Abstract: We discuss electronic and magnetic properties of Na$_x$Fe$_{1/2}$Mn$_{1/2}$O$_2$, a promising Na-ion battery cathode material. Using x-ray Compton scattering, SQUID magnetometry, and density-functional-theory based modeling, we probe how electrons and spins evolve during sodiation. By comparing Compton profiles of sodiated and desodiated samples, we show that oxygen 2$p$ orbitals drive the redox process, while transition-metal 3$d$ electrons become more delocalized, explaining the metallic phase at $x=2/3$. These profile differences define a quantitative descriptor for the sodiation range associated with improved conductivity. Electron holes on oxygen, reflected in oxygen magnetization, confirm the important role of oxygen in the electrochemical activity of the cathode.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12378v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Symmetries of Spin-Splitting Induced by Spin-Orbit Coupling in Non-magnetic Crystals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12396</link><description>arXiv:2602.12396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) leads to splitting of otherwise spin-degenerate bands in noncentrosymmetric materials, even if time-reversal symmetry is present. While this gives rise to well-known phenomena such as the Rashba and Dresselhaus effects, various other terms are allowed based on the point group of the crystal and the electronic Hamiltonian. In this study, we utilize point group representations to illustrate that four different types of SOC terms (Rashba, Dresselhaus, Weyl, and Ising) can emerge in periodic solids. We construct reciprocal space energy expressions for each type of SOC-induced splitting of opposite spin bands, and follow a similar procedure to also obtain minimal tight-binding models that capture all types of spin-splittings for subgroups of the cubic parent group $m\bar{3}m$. Furthermore, we also obtain a complete list of nodal features in the electronic band structure in these systems, distinguishing between crystallographic-symmetry-imposed nodal lines and those imposed by time-reversal-symmetry only. Finally, we conclude by presenting a list of materials that host each type of inversion-breaking SOC effects. Our classification of the spin-splitting symmetries in non-magnetic systems with SOC is the counterpart of the recent classification of spin-splitting symmetries in unconventional magnetic systems without SOC, such as altermagnets and odd-parity magnets. More broadly, our work provides a basis for studying superconductivity and other collective electronic phenomena that are impacted by SOC-induced band splittings in noncentrosymmetric materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12396v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Mechanism-driven CO2 Capture and Activation on Two-dimensional Transition-metal Diborides</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12562</link><description>arXiv:2602.12562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The urgent need to mitigate rising atmospheric CO2 levels motivates the search for stable, efficient, and tunable adsorbent materials. In this study, we employ first-principles density functional theory to investigate the adsorption of CO2 molecules on two-dimensional hexagonal transition-metal diboride monolayers, M2B2 (M = Sc, Y, Ti, Zr, Nb). The adsorption energies, structural distortions, and bonding characteristics are systematically analyzed to understand how the metal center governs CO2 activation. The calculated adsorption energies range from -1.84 to -2.16 eV (or -1.98 to -4.42 eV), with Ti2B2 and Sc2B2 exhibiting the strongest CO2 binding, while Y2B2, Zr2B2, and Nb2B2 show moderately strong chemisorption. Adsorption induces significant molecular activation, evidenced by elongated C-O bonds (1.27-1.29 Angstrom) and bent O-C-O angles (129-132 degrees), compared to the linear gas-phase configuration (1.17 Angstrom, 180 degrees). Charge analysis further reveals substantial electron transfer from the monolayer to CO2, consistent with strong chemisorption and structural deformation. Correspondingly, the shift toward less negative IpCOHP(Ef) values indicates a pronounced weakening of the internal C-O bonds, reflecting increased population of antibonding pi* orbitals. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations show that the activated CO2 species is thermally sensitive: while most M2B2 surfaces retain stable adsorption at 300 K, Ti2B2 drives spontaneous CO2 dissociation into CO and O, revealing a temperature-assisted activation pathway. These findings highlight how the choice of transition metal tunes electronic interactions, adsorption energetics, and activation pathways on M2B2 surfaces. Overall, this work identifies two-dimensional transition-metal diborides as promising candidates for next-generation CO2 capture and activation technologies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12562v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Magnetoplasmons in $N$-layer structures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12722</link><description>arXiv:2602.12722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a systematic framework to investigate the magnetoplasmons of multilayer two-dimensional electron systems by using the Kac--Murdock--Szeg\H{o} (KMS) Toeplitz matrix to consider interlayer Coulomb interactions. In the absence of interlayer tunneling, we show that the single-layer magnetoplasmon branch splits into $N$ collective modes -- one in-phase mode and $N-1$ out-of-phase modes -- and derive their asymptotic behaviors in the long-wavelength limit, as well as in the limit of large layer separation and strong magnetic fields. When interlayer tunneling is present, we clarify the magnetoplasmon dispersion, both qualitatively and quantitatively, by identifying the magnetoplasmon mode associated with each interband transition, as well as tunneling magnetoplasmons arising from interband transitions with the same Landau level index. Our study presents the hybridization between the modes governed by underlying symmetries, along with an enhanced tunneling magnetoplasmon gap exceeding the associated interband gap. The KMS-based analytic formalism thus provides a comprehensive physical understanding of magnetoplasmons in multilayer structures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12722v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Investigating Disordered Granular Matter via Ordered Geometric Fragmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12803</link><description>arXiv:2602.12803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of occupied volume under progressive fragmentation of granular matter is studied using a purely geometric model. Rather than modeling disorder directly, properties of disordered granular assemblies are investigated by analyzing an associated family of highly ordered reference configurations that provide sharp upper bounds on accessible volume. Grains are idealized as fragments derived from a hypothetical elongated parent prism with square cross section, sequentially sliced and reassembled into configurations that maximize the enclosed volume.
  Analytic expressions are derived for the maximal attainable volume at each fragmentation stage. The volume evolution is non-monotonic: initial fragmentation produces structures whose volume exceeds that of the original object, while further fragmentation leads to monotonic decrease converging to a limiting value of 5/4 times the initial volume, independent of the total number of fragments.
  The model reveals pairs of reassembled configurations built from geometrically indistinguishable building blocks yet enclosing different volumes. These conjugate configurations constitute purely geometric analogues of distinct phases connected by rearrangement-induced transitions. Explicit relations link the idealized construction to experimentally measurable grain parameters. Comparison with experimental data on cylindrical rods shows the predicted upper bound falls within the observed packing density range, demonstrating that the model captures essential geometric features despite its simplicity.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12803v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Turing patterns in Matrix-Weighted Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13080</link><description>arXiv:2602.13080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-driven instability is a fundamental mechanism underlying pattern formation in spatially extended systems. In almost all existing works, diffusion across the links of the underlying network is modeled through scalar weights, possibly complemented by cross-diffusion terms that are homogeneous across links. In this work, we investigate the emergence of Turing patterns on Matrix Weighted Networks (MWNs), a recently introduced framework in which each edge is associated with a matrix weight. Focusing on the class of coherent MWNs, we provide a novel characterization of coherence in terms of node-dependent orthonormal matrices, showing that link transformations can be written as relative rotations between nodes. This representation allows us to deal with coherent MWNs of any size and to introduce an orthonormal change of variables capable to reduce diffusion on a coherent MWN to diffusion on a standard weighted network with scalar weights. Building on this, we extend the classical Turing instability analysis to MWNs and derive the conditions under which a homogeneous equilibrium of the local dynamics loses stability due to matrix-weighted diffusion. Our results show how network topology, scalar weights, and inter-node transformations jointly shape pattern formation, and provide a constructive framework to analyze and design Turing patterns on matrix-weighted and higher-order networked systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.13080v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Physics-Informed Glass-Structure Descriptors for Assessing the Intrinsic Reactivity of Mixed Amorphous-Crystalline Precursors in Alkali-Activated Materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13101</link><description>arXiv:2602.13101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid and reliable assessment of the intrinsic reactivity of amorphous aluminosilicates is critical for their application in alkali-activated materials (AAMs) and blended cements. Although physics-informed glass-structure descriptors have demonstrated strong structure-reactivity relationships for predominantly amorphous systems, their extension to heterogeneous precursors with mixed crystalline-amorphous phases has been limited. Here, quantitative X-ray diffraction combined with bulk compositional analysis was used to reconstruct the effective amorphous compositions of five fly ashes (FAs) and three ground granulated blast-furnace slags (GGBSs). These compositions served as inputs for molecular dynamics simulations employing a melt-and-quench approach to generate atomic-scale structural models of the glassy phases. Based on these structures, the previously introduced descriptors, i.e., average metal oxygen dissociation energy and average metal oxygen bond strength, were refined to cover a broader compositional space spanning SiO2-Al2O3-TiO2-Fe2O3-CaO-MgO-MnO-Na2O-K2O. The refined descriptors exhibit strong inverse correlations with multiple independent reactivity indicators, including cumulative heat release from isothermal calorimetry, bound water content from thermogravimetric analysis, and compressive strength, for both single precursors and binary FA-GGBS blends activated with NaOH. These results demonstrate that physics-informed glass-structure descriptors can be extended from ideal amorphous systems to heterogeneous mixed-phase precursors and capture relative intrinsic reactivity trends in alkaline solutions. The proposed framework provides a transferable, structure-informed basis for comparative assessment of precursor reactivity that complements experimental testing and may inform precursor screening and mix designs for AAM and blended cement systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.13101v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Symmetric Gapped States and Symmetry-Enforced Gaplessness in 3-dimension</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12335</link><description>arXiv:2602.12335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a comprehensive framework for characterizing the infrared (IR) phases of a fermionic quantum theory in three spatial dimensions, based on its quantum anomalies associated with a finite symmetry. We uncover a fundamental dichotomy among these anomalies: the first class of anomalies can always be realized by symmetric gapped states, while the second class can never be realized by gapped states without breaking the given symmetry, establishing the phenomenon of symmetry-enforced gaplessness in these settings. Moreover, using the construction of symmetry extension, we construct the candidate gapped states that theories with the first class of anomalies can flow to in the IR. As an application, we provide concrete predictions of the candidate IR phases of (3+1)-dimensional gauge theories based on our results. Our results also suggest that systems with discrete chiral anomalies cannot be gapped out by adding arbitrary bosonic degrees of freedom.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12335v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Deconfinement from Thermal Tensor Networks: Universal CFT signature in (2+1)-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13124</link><description>arXiv:2602.13124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks offer a sign-problem-free approach to study lattice gauge theories, but extracting precise universal information associated with the deconfinement transition remains challenging. In this work, we study the deconfinement transition of (2+1)-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories at finite temperature using a thermal tensor network approach, where the partition functions at finite temperature are formulated as three-dimensional tensor networks. These tensor networks are first contracted in the temporal direction, and the subsequent coarse-graining in the spatial directions yields a renormalized transfer matrix, the spectrum of which directly encodes the universal conformal field theory data. In particular, by numerically extracting the central charge and scaling dimensions, we verify that the universality class of the thermal deconfinement transition matches the prediction of the Svetitsky-Yaffe conjecture for $N=2,3,5$. Moreover, we show that the $\mathbb{Z}_5$ theory at finite temperature exhibits an intermediate phase with an emergent U(1) symmetry. Critical couplings are determined via Gu-Wen ratios and agree with existing Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, extrapolating these critical couplings at finite temperature enables us to determine the deconfinement transition points for $N=2,3$ at zero temperature.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.13124v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] An Always-Accepting Algorithm for Transition Path Sampling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13130</link><description>arXiv:2602.13130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a one-way shooting algorithm for transition path sampling that accepts every proposed trajectory yet samples the correct transition path ensemble for systems with overdamped stochastic dynamics. The method is based on two key elements: a procedure to propose trajectories that are always reactive, and a reweighting scheme that corrects for the bias introduced by always accepting the proposed paths. This approach significantly improves the efficiency of transition path sampling by eliminating the cost associated with generating trajectories that are then rejected. We demonstrate the algorithm by investigating the formation of CO$_2$ clathrate hydrates along different reaction mechanisms, showing that the increased efficiency allows proper sampling of the formation of crystalline hydrates at temperatures and pressures that are difficult to access with conventional algorithms.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.13130v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Generation of wave turbulence in dipolar gases driven across their phase transitions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14123</link><description>arXiv:2410.14123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultracold quantum gases with long-range anisotropic interactions host novel exotic phases of matter, such as supersolids, exhibiting both rigid and superfluid characteristics. The impact of this interplay on the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of dipolar gases, and in particular its connection with universal turbulent behavior, remains highly unexplored. Here, upon considering a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate of dysprosium atoms being dynamically driven across the supersolid-superfluid phase transition and vice versa, we unveil the emergence of a robust nonequilibrium quasi-steady state. This state displays self-similar momentum distributions exhibiting algebraic decay at large momenta, with scaling exponents supporting the existence of wave turbulence. We demonstrate that supersolidity sustaining higher-lying momenta, associated with the roton minimum, promotes the development of turbulence. Our results provide a stepping stone toward unraveling and exploiting turbulent and self-similar behavior in anisotropically long-range interacting quantum gases amenable in current experiments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.14123v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Real-time adaptive tracking of fluctuating relaxation rates in superconducting qubits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09576</link><description>arXiv:2506.09576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fidelity of operations on a solid-state quantum processor is fundamentally bounded by environmental decoherence. Characterizing environmental fluctuations is challenging because the acquisition time of nonadaptive experimental protocols limits temporal precision and can average out rapid features of the underlying dynamics. Here, we overcome this temporal-resolution limit by two orders of magnitude using a field-programmable gate-array (FPGA) powered classical controller that adaptively and continuously tracks the relaxation-time fluctuations of two fixed-frequency superconducting transmon qubits, which exhibit average relaxation times of approximately 0.17 ms and occasionally exceed 0.5 ms. We report events in which the relaxation time switches by nearly an order of magnitude over timescales of just tens of milliseconds, rather than minutes or hours as previously reported. Our real-time Bayesian estimation protocol estimates relaxation times within a few milliseconds, close to the decoherence timescale itself. Our statistical analysis further suggests that some of these fast fluctuations arise from two-level systems switching at rates up to 10 Hz, four orders of magnitude faster than earlier reports. These results redefine the timescales relevant for calibration in superconducting quantum processing units, establish a reference for rapid relaxation-rate characterization in device screening, and improve our understanding of fast relaxation dynamics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.09576v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Universal properties of the many-body Lanczos algorithm at finite size</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17424</link><description>arXiv:2507.17424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the universal properties of the Lanczos algorithm applied to finite-size many-body quantum systems. Focusing on autocorrelation functions of local operators and on their infinite-time behaviour at finite size, we conjecture that in the large $n$ limit, the ratios between consecutive Lanczos coefficients should have specific scalings with the size of the lattice that we make precise and that depend on the hydrodynamic tail of the autocorrelation function. The scaling associated with strong or approximate zero-modes is also discussed. We support our conjecture with a numerical study of different models.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.17424v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Thermodynamic Isomorphism of Transformers: A Lagrangian Approach to Attention Dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08216</link><description>arXiv:2602.08216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an effective field-theoretic framework for analyzing Transformer attention through a thermodynamic lens. By constructing a Lagrangian on the information manifold equipped with the Fisher metric, we show that, within the Shannon--Boltzmann entropy framework, the Softmax function arises as a stationary solution minimizing a Helmholtz free energy functional. This establishes a formal correspondence between scaled dot-product attention and canonical ensemble statistics. Extending this mapping to macroscopic observables, we define an effective specific heat associated with fluctuations of the attention energy landscape. In controlled experiments on the modular addition task ($p = 19$--$113$), we observe a robust peak in this fluctuation measure that consistently precedes the onset of generalization. While no asymptotic power-law divergence is detected in this finite-depth regime, the reproducible enhancement of energy variance suggests a critical-like crossover accompanying representational reorganization. Our framework provides a unified statistical-mechanical perspective on attention scaling, training dynamics, and positional encoding, interpreting the phenomena as emergent properties of an effective thermodynamic system rather than isolated heuristics. Although the present results indicate finite-size crossover behavior rather than a strict phase transition, they motivate further investigation into scaling limits of deep architectures through fluctuation-based observables.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.08216v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] CacheMind: From Miss Rates to Why -- Natural-Language, Trace-Grounded Reasoning for Cache Replacement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12422</link><description>arXiv:2602.12422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cache replacement remains a challenging problem in CPU microarchitecture, often addressed using hand-crafted heuristics, limiting cache performance. Cache data analysis requires parsing millions of trace entries with manual filtering, making the process slow and non-interactive. To address this, we introduce CacheMind, a conversational tool that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable semantic reasoning over cache traces. Architects can now ask natural language questions like, "Why is the memory access associated with PC X causing more evictions?", and receive trace-grounded, human-readable answers linked to program semantics for the first time. To evaluate CacheMind, we present CacheMindBench, the first verified benchmark suite for LLM-based reasoning for the cache replacement problem. Using the SIEVE retriever, CacheMind achieves 66.67% on 75 unseen trace-grounded questions and 84.80% on 25 unseen policy-specific reasoning tasks; with RANGER, it achieves 89.33% and 64.80% on the same evaluations. Additionally, with RANGER, CacheMind achieves 100% accuracy on 4 out of 6 categories in the trace-grounded tier of CacheMindBench. Compared to LlamaIndex (10% retrieval success), SIEVE achieves 60% and RANGER achieves 90%, demonstrating that existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAGs) are insufficient for precise, trace-grounded microarchitectural reasoning. We provided four concrete actionable insights derived using CacheMind, wherein bypassing use case improved cache hit rate by 7.66% and speedup by 2.04%, software fix use case gives speedup of 76%, and Mockingjay replacement policy use case gives speedup of 0.7%; showing the utility of CacheMind on non-trivial queries that require a natural-language interface.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12422v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Arcalis: Accelerating Remote Procedure Calls Using a Lightweight Near-Cache Solution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12596</link><description>arXiv:2602.12596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern microservices increasingly depend on high-performance remote procedure calls (RPCs) to coordinate fine-grained, distributed computation. As network bandwidths continue to scale, the CPU overhead associated with RPC processing, particularly serialization, deserialization, and protocol handling, has become a critical bottleneck. This challenge is exacerbated by fast user-space networking stacks such as DPDK, which expose RPC processing as the dominant performance limiter. While prior work has explored software optimizations and FPGA-based offload engines, these approaches remain physically distant from the CPU's memory hierarchy, incurring unnecessary data movement and cache pollution. We present Arcalis, a near-cache RPC accelerator that positions a lightweight hardware engine adjacent to the last-level cache (LLC). Arcalis offloads RPC processing to dedicated microengines on receive and transmit paths that operate with cache-line latency while preserving programmability. By decoupling RPC processing logic, enabling microservice-specific execution, and positioning itself near the LLC to immediately consume data injected by network cards, Arcalis achieves 1.79-4.16$\times$ end-to-end speedup compared to the CPU baseline, while significantly reducing microarchitectural overhead by up to 88%, and achieves up to a 1.62$\times$ higher throughput than prior solutions. These results highlight the potential of near-cache RPC acceleration as a practical solution for high-performance microservice deployment.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12596v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] DPUConfig: Optimizing ML Inference in FPGAs Using Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12847</link><description>arXiv:2602.12847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogeneous embedded systems, with diverse computing elements and accelerators such as FPGAs, offer a promising platform for fast and flexible ML inference, which is crucial for services such as autonomous driving and augmented reality, where delays can be costly. However, efficiently allocating computational resources for deep learning applications in FPGA-based systems is a challenging task. A Deep Learning Processor Unit (DPU) is a parameterizable FPGA-based accelerator module optimized for ML inference. It supports a wide range of ML models and can be instantiated multiple times within a single FPGA to enable concurrent execution. This paper introduces DPUConfig, a novel runtime management framework, based on a custom Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent, that dynamically selects optimal DPU configurations by leveraging real-time telemetry data monitoring, system utilization, power consumption, and application performance to inform its configuration selection decisions. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that the RL agent achieves energy efficiency 95% (on average) of the optimal attainable energy efficiency for several CNN models on the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU102.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12847v1</guid></item><item><title>[The

To explore alternative strategies, we developed a high-dimensional immune profiling framework using 40-marker spectral flow cytometry to characterize peripheral blood from healthy individuals and treatment-naïve PDAC patients across disease stages. This platform identified over 70 immune cell subsets and revealed stage-associated immune remodeling, including the expansion of effector and memory T-cell populations, accompanied by reductions in naïve and selected regulatory and innate compartments.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00409-8?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Distinct mutational signature and clonal evolution in constitutional mismatch repair deficiency-associated high-grade gliomas</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00404-9?rss=yes</link><description>Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (CMMRD) is a rare cancer-predisposing syndrome. Recent studies have advanced our understanding of the genomic and epigenomic features of this disease, however, the mutational signatures and clonal evolution of CMMRD-associated high-grade gliomas (HGGs) requires further investigation. Herein, we analyzed the mutational signature and clonal evolution of 25 CMMRD-associated HGGs. Germline biallelic mutations in MSH6 (56.0%), PMS2 (36.0%), MLH1 (8.0%) were identified.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid

Abstract: We introduce stratified symmetry operators and stratified anomalies in quantum lattice systems as generalizations of onsite symmetry operators and onsite projective representations. A stratified symmetry operator is a symmetry operator that factorizes into mutually independent subsystem symmetry operators; its stratified anomaly is defined as the collection of anomalies associated with these subsystem operators. We develop a cellular chain complex formalism for stratified anomalies of internal symmetries and show that, in the presence of crystalline symmetries, they give rise to Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) constraints. This includes LSM anomalies and SPT-LSM theorems. We apply this framework to modulated $G$ symmetries, which are symmetries whose total symmetry group is ${G_\mathrm{tot} = G \rtimes G_\mathrm{s}}$, with $G_\mathrm{s}$ the crystalline symmetry group. Notably, a nonzero stratified anomaly within a fundamental domain of $G_\mathrm{s}$ (e.g., a unit cell) does not always imply an LSM anomaly for modulated symmetries. Instead, the existence of an LSM anomaly also depends on how $G_\mathrm{s}$ acts on $G$. When $G_\mathrm{s}$ is the lattice translation group, we find an explicit criterion for when a stratified anomaly causes an LSM anomaly, and classify LSM anomalies using homology groups of $G_\mathrm{s}$-invariant cellular chains. We illustrate this through examples of exponential and dipole symmetries with stratified anomalies, both in ${(1+1)}$D and ${(2+1)}$D, and construct a stabilizer code model of a modulated SPT subject to an SPT-LSM theorem.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11266v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Jamming-controlled stochasticity in metal-insulator switching</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11302</link><description>arXiv:2602.11302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling phase transitions is a fundamental part of physics and has been central to many technological revolutions, from steam engines to field-effect transistors. At present, there is strong interest in materials with strongly coupled structural and electronic phase transitions, which hold promise for energy-efficient technologies. Utilizing a structural phase transition and controlling its plasticity naturally leads to built-in memory, a key feature for emulating neurons and synapses in neuromorphic technologies. Here, $\textit{operando}$ Bragg X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy is used to study the evolution of the nano-domain distribution at the micron-scale in neuromorphic devices made from the archetypal Mott insulator vanadium dioxide. It is found that after electrical switching, slow nano-domain reconfiguration occurs on timescales of thousands of seconds and that the domains undergo a jamming transition, offering control over switching stochasticity at the micron scale. More precisely, repetitive above-threshold currents plastically drive the system into a jammed/glassy state where switching becomes deterministic, while sub-threshold currents erase the short-term memory contained in the nano-domain distribution, recovering stochastic switching, thus offering a path for in-device learning. The results illustrate the importance of studying the nanoscale physics associated with phase transitions in strongly correlated materials, even for macroscopic devices, and offer guidance for future device operation schemes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11302v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Gaussian Expansion Method for few-body states in two-dimensional materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11386</link><description>arXiv:2602.11386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of trions in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) monolayers using the Gaussian Expansion Method (GEM) adapted to two-dimensional systems. Excitons and trions in monolayer TMDCs with the chemical composition MX$_2$ in the 2H phase are studied systematically. We computed the associated exciton and trion binding energies. We find in addition to the known $J = 0$ trion the existence of a bound state with orbital angular momentum $J = 1$. The results for $J = 0$ are benchmarked against existing calculations from the Stochastic Variational Method (SVM) and Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). Furthermore, we analyze the trion internal structure and geometry through their probability density distributions, accounting for the effects of different material shows that GEM -- widely used in studies of strongly interacting few-body systems -- is well adapted to allow comprehensive and computationally efficient investigations of trions and potentially other weakly bound few-body states in layered materials. In addition, we systematically exploit the effect of strain and dieletric environment in the $J = 1$ trion predictions, illustrated for the MoS$_2$ monolayer example.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11386v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Metastable Dynamical Computing with Energy Landscapes: A Primer</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11390</link><description>arXiv:2602.11390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smartphones, laptops, and data centers are CMOS-based technologies that ushered our world into the information age of the 21st century. Despite their advantages for scalable computing, their implementations come with surprisingly large energetic costs. This challenge has revitalized scientific and engineering interest in energy-efficient information-processing designs. One current paradigm -- dynamical computing -- controls the location and shape of minima in potential energy landscapes that are connected to a thermal environment. The landscape supports distinguishable metastable energy minima that serve as a system's mesoscopic memory states. Information is represented by microstate distributions. Dynamically manipulating the memory states then corresponds to information processing. This framing provides a natural description of the associated thermodynamic transformations and required resources. Appealing to bifurcation theory, a computational protocol in the metastable regime can be analyzed by tracking the evolution of fixed points in the state space. We illustrate the paradigm's capabilities by performing 1-bit and 2-bit computations with double-well and quadruple-well potentials, respectively. These illustrate how dynamical computing can serve as a basis for designing universal logic gates and investigating their out-of-equilibrium thermodynamic performance.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11390v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Krylov space perturbation theory for quantum synchronization in closed systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11431</link><description>arXiv:2602.11431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly interacting quantum many-body systems are expected to thermalize, however, some evade thermalization due to symmetries. Quantum synchronization provides one such example of ergodicity breaking, but previous studies have focused on open systems. Here, motivated by the problem of ergodicity breaking in closed systems and the study of non-trivial dynamics, we investigate synchronization in a closed disordered Heisenberg spin chain. In the presence of large random disorder, strongly breaking the permutation symmetry of the system, we observe the emergence of spatial synchronization, where spins lock into locally synchronized patches. This behavior can be interpreted as a fragmentation of the global dynamical symmetry $S^+$ into a collection of local dynamical symmetries, each characterized by a distinct frequency. In the weak-disorder regime, still without permutation symmetry, we show that the synchronization mechanism can be understood perturbatively within Krylov space. In the absence of disorder, the Krylov space associated with the dynamical symmetry $S^+$ is two-dimensional. Introducing disorder couples this subspace to the remainder of the Krylov space. This coupling leads only to a second-order correction to the frequency of the dynamical symmetry, thereby preserving coherent oscillations despite the presence of small disorder. At stronger disorder, the perturbation modifies $S^+$ so that it acquires a finite lifetime, providing an example of a transient dynamical symmetry.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11431v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Thermodynamics of Shastry-Sutherland Model under Magnetic Field</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11589</link><description>arXiv:2602.11589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent experimental discovery of the $T$-linear specific heat in pressurized and magnetized Shastry-Sutherland Mott insulator SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$, we perform the state-of-the-art thermal tensor-network computation on the Shastry-Sutherland model under a magnetic field. Our simulation results suggest the existence of a symmetric intermediate phase with $T$-linear specific heat at low temperature, occupying a large parameter space and separating the plaquette-singlet phase and antiferromagnetic phase at low fields and other symmetry-breaking phases at high fields before the system is fully polarized. Such an unexpected novel state bears an astonishing similarity to the experimental findings in the material. It opens the door to further investigations of the possible liberation of deconfined magnetized Dirac spinons by the competing interactions in this highly frustrated quantum magnet model, and by the combined effects of magnetic field and pressure in the the associated Shastry-Sutherland Mott insulator SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11589v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spin-Chain Incipient Magnetocaloric Effect and Rare-Earth Controlled Switching in the Haldane-Chain System, R2BaNiO5</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11634</link><description>arXiv:2602.11634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have experimentally investigated the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) of a prototype spin-frustrated one-dimensional spin-chain system, the famous Haldane-chain system, R2BaNiO5 (R = Nd, Gd, Er, Dy). The significant MCE is observed far above long-range ordering, even in the paramagnetic region, which is attributed to the change in magnetic entropy due to short-range spin correlation arising from (low-dimensional) magnetic frustration. Such a spin-chain incipient MCE above long-range ordering is rarely reported. Interestingly, multiple magnetocaloric switching from conventional to inverse MCE (and vice versa) are observed below long-range magnetic ordering, as a function of temperature and magnetic field, for the R = Nd, Dy, and Er members. However, such MCE switching is absent in the Gd member, which is an S-state atom (orbital moment L = 0). Our systematic investigation of this series demonstrates that the interplay between crystal-electric field (CEF), strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and rare earth anisotropy of R-ions play an important role in spin reorientation, leading to multiple MCE switching due to intriguing changes in magnetic and lattice entropy. The maximum change of entropy for Er, Gd, Dy and Nd is 7.8, 6.8, 4.0 and 1.0 J Kg-1 K-1 respectively. Our study presents a pathway for tuning MCE switching and the MCE effect over large temperature regions in d-f coupled spin-frustrated and spin-chain oxide systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11634v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] First-order phase transition in atom-molecule quantum degenerate mixtures with coherent three-body recombination</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11637</link><description>arXiv:2602.11637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We map the phase diagram of a two-mode atom-molecule Bose-Einstein condensate with Fano-Feshbach and coherent three-body recombination (cTBR) terms. The standard second order phase transition observed as the molecular energy is tuned through the Feshbach resonance, is replaced by a first order transition when cTBR becomes prominent, due to a double-well structure in the free energy landscape. This transition is associated with atom-molecule entanglement, bistability, and molecular metastability. Our results establish cTBR as a powerful knob for quantum state engineering and control of reaction dynamics in ultracold chemistry.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11637v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Ordered states of undoped AB bilayer graphene: bias induced cascade of transitions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11647</link><description>arXiv:2602.11647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using mean-field theory, we determine the electronic phase diagram of undoped AB-stacked bilayer graphene in the presence of a transverse electric field. In addition to multiple competing electronic instabilities characterized by excitonic order parameters, our framework incorporates the long-range Coulomb energy associated with interlayer polarization. This long-range interaction plays a crucial role, as it significantly influences both the structure and the relative energies of the competing ordered states. We derive a set of self-consistency equations and solve them both numerically and analytically. Our findings reveal that, as the bias field is varied, the bilayer undergoes a cascade of first-order transitions between several ordered insulating phases for which order-parameter structures are explicitly identified. Some of these phases are characterized by two inequivalent single-particle gaps, whose magnitudes depend on the valley and spin quantum numbers. Field-driven transitions are accompanied by discontinuous and non-monotonic variations of the single-electron gap. We relate our results to Hartree-Fock numerical calculations and to experimental research, including observations of fractional metallic phases that emerge upon doping the bilayer system.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11647v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Phase-Space Topology and Spectral Flow in Screened Magnetized Plasmas</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11763</link><description>arXiv:2602.11763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological wave phenomena in continuous media are fundamentally challenged by unbounded spectra and the absence of a compact Brillouin zone, which obstruct conventional bulk--interface formulations. We develop a unified phase-space framework for screened magnetized plasma based on a pseudo-Hermitian formulation with a positive-definite metric, enabling a generalized Schr\"odinger description and a Weyl-symbol analysis of the bulk generator. We show that the bulk symbol hosts isolated band degeneracies acting as Berry--Chern monopoles, including a higher-order spin-1 degeneracy with topological charge $+2$ that generically splits into two spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ Weyl points under symmetry breaking. To characterize topology in this noncompact setting, we introduce a strip-gap Chern number associated with finite real-frequency strips of the bulk spectrum, extending band Chern topology to continuum systems. This invariant governs the spectral flow of interface modes induced by spatial variations of the magnetic field and establishes a bulk--interface correspondence at the level of phase-space symbols. By solving the interface eigenvalue problem, we demonstrate that the net spectral flow across the strip gap is determined by the enclosed monopole charge. We further show that this correspondence persists under collisional damping, provided that a finite strip gap remains and no exceptional points enter it. Our results provide a systematic phase-space framework for topological wave transport in continuous media beyond compact-band and idealized Hermitian settings.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11763v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method with spin-orbit coupling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11866</link><description>arXiv:2602.11866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is incorporated into the phaseless plane-wave-based auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (pw-AFQMC) method. This integration is implemented using optimized multiple-projector norm-conserving pseudopotentials, which are derived from the fully-relativistic (FR) atomic all-electron Dirac-like equation. The inclusion of SOC enables accurate phaseless pw-AFQMC calculations that capture both electronic correlation and SOC effects concurrently, greatly improving the method's applicability for studying systems containing heavy atoms. We discuss the form of FR pseudopotentials and detail the corresponding formulations of phaseless pw-AFQMC with a two-component Hamiltonian in the spinor basis. The accuracy of our approach is demonstrated by computing the dissociation energy of molecule I2 and the cohesive energy of bulk Pb, highlighting the large influence of SOC in both. Subsequently, we determine the transition pressure of the III-V compound InP from its zinc-blende to rock-salt phase by constructing and analyzing their respective equations of state.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11866v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Thermodynamic Stability and Hydrogen Bonds in Mixed Halide Perovskites</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12031</link><description>arXiv:2602.12031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of mixed halide perovskites against phase separation is crucial for their optoelectronic applications, yet difficult to rationalize due to the interplay of enthalpic, configurational, and dynamical effects. Here we present a simple thermodynamic framework for multicomponent halide perovskites of composition FA$_{1-x}$MA$_{x-y}$Cs$_y$Pb(I$_{1-z}$Br$_z$)$_3$, based on \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics. By decomposing the free energy of mixing into enthalpic, configurational, and rotational entropic contributions, we show that although the enthalpy of mixing is generally positive, the solid solutions are thermodynamically stable against phase separation due to the large configurational entropy associated with random substitution on cation and halide sublattices. Mixing reduces the rotational entropy of the organic cations, partially offsetting the configurational stabilization. However, within our model, this rotational penalty is not sufficient to overcome the configurational driving force, and a curvature analysis within a regular-solution model does not predict a miscibility gap for any of the mixing channels considered. Analysis of hydrogen-bond dynamics shows that MA--Y (Y = I, Br) interactions are more persistent than FA--Y interactions, while the dominant FA-donated N$-$H$\cdots$I hydrogen bonds remain nearly composition-invariant. Cs-containing mixtures, in which Cs$^{+}$ forms no hydrogen bonds, can nevertheless be thermodynamically stable. These results demonstrate that hydrogen bonding does not control thermodynamic stability in mixed halide perovskites. Instead, phase stability is governed by the balance between strong configurational entropy and a smaller, systematically destabilizing rotational-entropy correction.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12031v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Markov State Models for Tracking Reaction Dynamics on Catalytic Nanoparticles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12037</link><description>arXiv:2602.12037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markov state models (MSMs) are a powerful tool to analyze and coarse-grain complex dynamical data into interpretable kinetic processes. This capability is particularly important in heterogeneous catalysis, where a medley of reactants and intermediates interact on surfaces that might simultaneously experience structural fluctuations. For these very complex systems, standard transition state theory (TST) approaches are no longer appropriate, motivating alternative approaches that can retain dynamical complexity while providing physical insight. With machine learned interatomic potentials being more and more ubiquitous, directly simulating complex catalytic systems with molecular dynamics (MD) is becoming increasingly feasible. Extending MSMs to dynamically coarse grain MD simulation data of catalytic processes, we analyze hydrogen dynamics on rhodium catalysts with slab and nanoparticle geometries over a range of hydrogen surface concentrations. Somewhat counterintuitively, nanoparticle features, such as corners and edges, effectively slow down the association/dissociation process, and the cooperative behavior of hydrogen-hydrogen interactions leads to a non-monotonic concentration dependence of the rates, which would not be predicted with standard TST.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12037v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A critical assessment of bonding descriptors for predicting materials properties</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12109</link><description>arXiv:2602.12109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most machine learning models for materials science rely on descriptors based on materials compositions and structures, even though the chemical bond has been proven to be a valuable concept for predicting materials properties. Over the years, various theoretical frameworks have been developed to characterize bonding in solid-state materials. However, integrating bonding information from these frameworks into machine learning pipelines at scale has been limited by the lack of a systematically generated and validated database. Recent advances in high-throughput bonding analysis workflows have addressed this issue, and our previously computed Quantum-Chemical Bonding Database for Solid-State Materials was extended to include approximately 13,000 materials. This database is then used to derive a new set of quantum-chemical bonding descriptors. A systematic assessment is performed using statistical significance tests to evaluate how the inclusion of these descriptors influences the performance of machine-learning models that otherwise rely solely on structure- and composition-derived features. Models are built to predict elastic, vibrational, and thermodynamic properties typically associated with chemical bonding in materials. The results demonstrate that incorporating quantum-chemical bonding descriptors not only improves predictive performance but also helps identify intuitive expressions for properties such as the projected force constant and lattice thermal conductivity via symbolic regression.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12109v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Charged moments and symmetry-resolved entanglement from Ballistic Fluctuation Theory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12185</link><description>arXiv:2602.12185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The charged moments of a reduced density matrix provide a natural starting point for deriving symmetry-resolved R\'enyi and entanglement entropies, which quantify how entanglement is distributed among symmetry sectors in the presence of a global internal symmetry in a quantum many-body system. In this work, we study charged moments within the framework of Ballistic Fluctuation Theory (BFT). This theory describes large-scale ballistic fluctuations of conserved charges and associated currents and, by exploiting the height-field formulation of twist fields, gives access to the asymptotic behaviour of their two-point correlation functions. In Del Vecchio Del Vecchio et al. $[1]$, this approach was applied to the special case of branch-point twist fields used to compute entanglement entropies within the replica approach. Here, we extend those results by applying BFT to composite branch-point twist fields, obtained by inserting an additional gauge field. Focusing on free fermions, we derive analytic expressions for charged R\'enyi entropies both at equilibrium, in generalized Gibbs ensembles, and out of equilibrium following a quantum quench from $U(1)$ preserving pair producing integrable initial states. In the latter case, our results agree with the conjecture arising from the quasiparticle picture.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12185v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A physics-informed data-driven framework for modeling hyperelastic materials with progressive damage and failure</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11414</link><description>arXiv:2602.11414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a two-stage physics-informed, data-driven constitutive modeling framework for hyperelastic soft materials undergoing progressive damage and failure. The framework is grounded in the concept of hyperelasticity with energy limiters and employs Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to separately learn the intact (undamaged) elastic response and damage evolution directly from data. In Stage I, GPR models learn the intact hyperelastic response through volumetric and isochoric response functions (or only the isochoric response under incompressibility), ensuring energetic consistency of the intact response and satisfaction of fundamental principles such as material frame indifference and balance of angular momentum. In Stage II, damage is modeled via a separate GPR model that learns the mapping between the intact strain energy density predicted by Stage I models and a stress-reduction factor governing damage and failure, with monotonicity, non-negativity, and complete-failure constraints enforced through penalty-based optimization to ensure thermodynamic admissibility. Validation on synthetic datasets, including benchmarking against analytical constitutive models and competing data-driven approaches, demonstrates high in-distribution accuracy under uniaxial tension and robust generalization from limited training data to compression and shear modes not used during training. Application to experimental brain tissue data demonstrates the practical applicability of the framework and enables inference of damage evolution and critical failure energy. Overall, the proposed framework combines the physical consistency, interpretability, and generalizability of analytical models with the flexibility, predictive accuracy, and automation of machine learning, offering a powerful approach for modeling failure in soft materials under limited experimental data.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11414v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Experimental challenges and prospects for quantum-enhanced energy conversion: Stationary Fano coherence in V-type qutrits interacting with polarized incoherent radiation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11695</link><description>arXiv:2602.11695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum coherence offers potential for energy conversion technologies. It influences light absorption and emission, affecting energy conversion limits and efficiency. As a result, quantum coherence is being harnessed to boost performance in quantum heat engines, photocells, and photosynthetic-inspired platforms. Of particular interest in this context is the generation of Fano coherences, i.e., the formation of quantum coherences due to the interaction with the continuum of modes characterizing an incoherent process. We aim to formalize mathematically the possibility of achieving steady-state Fano coherence in a V-type three-level quantum system using polarized incoherent radiation, without requiring the energy difference between the excited levels to tend to zero. We perform this analysis by deriving the Bloch-Redfield equation from first-principles by quantizing the incoherent radiation. The resulting reduced dynamics of the system are analysed, so as to determine the lifetime of Fano coherence and identify the conditions under which it becomes stationary. We characterise distinct dynamical regimes, ranging from weak to strong pumping, in which steady-state Fano coherence emerges, and we quantitatively determine its magnitude. For each regime, we analyse the generation of Fano coherence as a function of both the intensity of the incoherent pumping and the energy splitting between the excited levels. We also assess how obtaining Fano coherence is modified by symmetric or asymmetric decay rates. These findings indicate that a three-level quantum system driven by polarized incoherent light can act as a robust resource for coherence-assisted energy conversion and storage. Finally, we discuss the experimental challenges associated with the implementation of the proposed model using an ensemble of Rubidium atoms.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11695v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Refined half-integer condition on RG flows</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12085</link><description>arXiv:2602.12085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Renormalization group flows are constrained by symmetries. Traditionally, we have made the most of 't Hooft anomalies associated to the symmetries. The anomaly is mathematically part of the data for the monoidal structure on symmetry categories. The symmetry categories sometimes admit additional structures such as braiding. It was found that the additional structures give further constraints on renormalization group flows. One of these constraints is the half-integer condition. The condition claims the following. Braidings are characterized by conformal dimensions. A symmetry object $c$ in a braided symmetry category surviving all along the flow thus has two conformal dimensions, one in ultraviolet $h_c^\text{UV}$ and the other in infrared $h_c^\text{IR}$. In a renormalization group flow with a renormalization group defect, they add up to a half-integer $h_c^\text{UV}+h_c^\text{IR}\in\frac12\mathbb Z$. We find a necessary condition for the sum to be half-integer. We solve some flows with the refined half-integer condition.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12085v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Superconductivity in overdoped cuprates can be understood from a BCS perspective!</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25767</link><description>arXiv:2510.25767v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We summarize key experimental studies of the low energy properties of overdoped cuprate high temperature superconductors and conclude that a theoretical understanding of the ``essential physics" is achievable in terms of a conventional Fermi-liquid treatment of the normal state, and a BCS mean-field treatment of the (d-wave) superconducting state. For this perspective to be consistent, it is necessary to posit that there is a crossover from a strongly correlated underdoped regime (where a different theoretical perspective is necessary) to the more weakly correlated overdoped regime. It is also necessary to argue that the various observed features of the overdoped materials that are inconsistent with this perspective can be attributed to the expected effects of the intrinsic disorder associated with most of the materials being solid state solutions (alloys). As a test of this idea, we make a series of falsifiable predictions concerning the expected behavior of an ``ideal" (disorder free) overdoped cuprate.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.25767v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Wigner Cat Phases: A finely tunable system for exploring the transition to quantum chaos</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22169</link><description>arXiv:2512.22169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A transition to quantum chaos is characterized by a finely tunable mixed random matrix ensemble. The {\it mixed Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (mGOE)} offers a pedagogically accessible framework for simulating {\it Many-Body Localization (MBL)} transitions. It can be tuned from chaotic to localized and heavy-tailed phases in a continuous fashion, providing an opportunity to explore new phases. We numerically study how the spectral properties of mGOE evolve across these transitions. Characterization of the transition to quantum chaos is computed and analyzed via empirical spectral density, nearest-neighbor spacing, and adjacent gap, with statistical uncertainty quantification that strengthens the robustness of the evidence for transitions. The transitions are identified as the {\it Wigner Cat Phases}, due to the shape of empirical spectral density, which depend on the tunable parameter. These simulated phases in mGOE provide a valuable framework to study the {\it Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH)} and its related transitions, representing a family of systems with tunable localization and disorder.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22169v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] MING: An Automated CNN-to-Edge MLIR HLS framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11966</link><description>arXiv:2602.11966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by the increasing demand for low-latency and real-time processing, machine learning applications are steadily migrating toward edge computing platforms, where Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are widely adopted for their energy efficiency compared to CPUs and GPUs. To generate high-performance and low-power FPGA designs, several frameworks built upon High Level Synthesis (HLS) vendor tools have been proposed, among which MLIR-based frameworks are gaining significant traction due to their extensibility and ease of use. However, existing state-of-the-art frameworks often overlook the stringent resource constraints of edge devices. To address this limitation, we propose MING, an Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR)-based framework that abstracts and automates the HLS design process. Within this framework, we adopt a streaming architecture with carefully managed buffers, specifically designed to handle resource constraints while ensuring low-latency. In comparison with recent frameworks, our approach achieves on average 15x speedup for standard Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) kernels with up to four layers, and up to 200x for single-layer kernels. For kernels with larger input sizes, MING is capable of generating efficient designs that respect hardware resource constraints, whereas state-of-the-art frameworks struggle to meet.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11966v1</guid></item><item><title>[Nature] Is social media addictive for teens?

Abstract: Cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) provides strong light-matter interactions that can be used for manipulating and detecting quantum states. The interaction can be enhanced by increasing the resonator's impedance, while approaching the quantum impedance ($h/e^2$) remains challenging. Edge plasmons emergent as chiral bosonic modes in the quantum Hall channels provide high quantized impedance of $h/ \nu e^2$ that can exceed 10 k$\Omega$ for the Landau-level filling factor $\nu \leq 2$, well beyond the impedance of free space. Here, we apply such a high-impedance plasmon mode in a quantum-Hall plasmon resonator to demonstrate dispersive detection of a nearby charge qubit formed in a double quantum dot. The phase shift in microwave transmission through the plasmon resonator follows the dispersive shift associated with the qubit state in agreement with the cQED theory. The high impedance allows us to perform dispersive detection of qubit spectroscopy with a plasmon resonator having a broad bandwidth. Leveraging these topological edge modes, our results establish two-dimensional topological insulators as a new platform of cQED.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.10472v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Antiferroaxial altermagnetism</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10641</link><description>arXiv:2602.10641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The antiferroaxial state is emerging as an important ferroic order in condensed matter systems. Here, we establish antiferroaxial altermagnetism as a broadly prevalent, generic, and microscopically grounded multiferroic mechanism, in which antiferroaxial counter-rotating distortions both induce altermagnetism and enable its deterministic and reversible switching. Within a unified Landau-theory and symmetry framework, we identify a symmetry-allowed trilinear invariant coupling the antiferroaxial order, the N\'{e}el vector, and the altermagnetic order, and derive general symmetry criteria for its occurrence. This coupling locks the induced altermagnetism to the antiferroaxial order, so that reversing the latter reverses the spin splitting and associated time-reversal-odd responses, such as anomalous Hall conductivity. We provide a practical spin group dictionary mapping N\'{e}el-vector representations to the resulting $d$-, $g$-, and $i$-wave antiferroaxial altermagnetism, validate the mechanism with ligand-rotation tight-binding models and first-principles calculations, and identify many candidate materials by screening the MAGNDATA and C2DB databases. Our results elevate antiferroaxiality to a universal ferroic control knob for structurally programmable altermagnetic spintronics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.10641v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Analytic Nonlinear Theory of Shear Banding in Amorphous Solids</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10677</link><description>arXiv:2602.10677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to offer an analytic theory of the shear banding instability in amorphous solids that are subjected to athermal quasi-static shear. To this aim we derive nonlinear equations for the displacement field, including the consequences of plastic deformation on the mechanical response of amorphous solids. The plastic events collectively induce distributed dipoles that are responsible for screening effects and the creation of typical length-scales that are absent in classical elasticity theory. The nonlinear theory exposes an instability that results in the creation of shear bands. By solving the weakly nonlinear amplitude equation we present analytic expressions for the displacement fields that is associated with shear bands, explaining the role of the elastic moduli that determine the width of a shear band from ductile to brittle characteristics. We derive an energy functional whose Hessian possesses an eigenvalue that goes to zero at the shear-banding instability, providing a prediction for the critical value of the accumulated stress that results in an instability.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.10677v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Field-driven Ion Pairing Dynamics in Concentrated Electrolytes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10257</link><description>arXiv:2602.10257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate ion pairing dynamics in electrolytes driven far from equilibrium using molecular simulations and nonequilibrium rate theory. Focusing on 0.5 M $\mathrm{LiPF_6}$ in water and acetonitrile under uniform electric fields, we compute transition path theory observables including reactive fluxes and mean first-passage times of ion pairing. Moreover, we introduce a dynamical proxy of free-ion population, where its field-induced change is strongly correlated with the nonlinear enhancement of conductivity, yielding an increase of $40 \ \%$ at 50 mV/{\AA} in acetonitrile, compared to less than $10 \ \%$ in aqueous electrolytes. Further kinetic analysis elucidates that Onsager's classical theory substantially overestimates field-induced enhancement of ion pair dissociation in molecular electrolytes. This discrepancy arises from solvent-mediated dynamical pathways and field-induced dielectric decrement that suppress ion pair dissociation within explicit solvents, highlighting that a faithful description of molecular details is essential. Our results provide a molecular interpretation of nonlinear electrolyte transport beyond continuum theories and establish a general framework for quantifying nonequilibrium reaction kinetics in condensed phase systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.10257v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Anomalous diffusion in convergence to effective ergodicity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08693</link><description>arXiv:1606.08693v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of diffusion is usually studied for particles or time-evolving systems. Similar in principle, such studies can be conducted by tracking how a given function of observable properties evolves over time-akin to the evolution of observable functions-referred to as functional-diffusion. This is not the same as the system's individual trajectories, but can be regarded as a meta-trajectory. Following this idea, we measure how the approach to ergodicity evolves over time for the observed magnetization of a full Ising model with an external field. We compute the diffusive behavior of the functional across a range of temperatures via Metropolis and Glauber single-spin-flip dynamics. The system's ensemble-averaged dynamics are computed using expressions from the exact solution. Power-law behavior in the approach to ergodicity provides a classification of anomalies in functional-diffusion, demonstrating nonlinear anomalous behavior over different temperature and field ranges. Studying the ergodicity convergence of these meta-trajectories can help validate and enhance the pedagogical understanding of nonequilibrium thermodynamic systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:1606.08693v5</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dielectric Properties of Single Crystal Calcium Tungstate</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21662</link><description>arXiv:2507.21662v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This investigation employed microwave whispering gallery mode (WGM) analysis to characterize the dielectric properties of a cylindrical, single-crystal sample of calcium tungstate (CaWO$_4$). Through investigation of quasi-transverse\hyp{}magnetic and quasi-transverse\hyp{}electric mode families, we can assess loss mechanisms and relative permittivity from room temperature down to cryogenic conditions. We report the biaxial permittivity values of $\epsilon_{||} = 9.029 \pm 0.009$ and $\epsilon_{\perp} = 10.761 \pm 0.01$ at $295$ K, and $\epsilon_{||} = 8.794 \pm 0.009$ and $\epsilon_{\perp} = 10.440 \pm 0.01$ at $4$ K. Components are denoted with respect to the c\hyp{}axis of the crystal unit cell. The parallel component agrees well with the published literature at MHz frequencies; however, the perpendicular component is $4.8$\% lower. The WGM technique offers greater precision, with accuracy limited primarily by the uncertainty in the crystal's dimensions. WGMs also serve as sensitive probes of lattice dynamics, enabling monitoring of temperature-dependent loss mechanisms. At room temperature, the measured loss tangents were $\tan\delta_{||}^{295,\mathrm{K}} = (4.1 \pm 1.4) \times 10^{-5}$ and $\tan\delta_{\perp}^{295,\mathrm{K}} = (3.64 \pm 0.92) \times 10^{-5}$. Upon cooling to 4 K, the loss tangents improved by approximately two orders of magnitude, reaching $\tan\delta_{||}^{4,\mathrm{K}} = (1.56 \pm 0.52) \times 10^{-7}$ and $\tan\delta_{\perp}^{4,\mathrm{K}} = (2.05 \pm 0.79) \times 10^{-7}$. These cryogenic values are higher than those reported in prior studies, likely due to a magnetic loss channel associated with an unidentified paramagnetic spin ensemble. These findings have implications for the use of CaWO$_4$ in applications such as spin-based quantum systems and cryogenic bolometry, highlighting the potential of WGMs for novel sensing applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.21662v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Magnetic field-induced momentum-dependent symmetry breaking in a kagome superconductor</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11341</link><description>arXiv:2512.11341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When multiple degrees of freedom share similar energy scales in quantum materials, intertwined electronic orders, which exhibit broken symmetries, are often strongly coupled. Recent studies on kagome superconductors such as CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ report rotational and time-reversal symmetry breaking linked to a charge density wave. Here, we observe a momentum-selective response of the electronic structure of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ to an external magnetic field. By performing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in a tuneable magnetic field, we demonstrate that the response of the electronic structure is compatible with piezomagnetism along with strong orbital selectivity. Our results show that the origin of the time-reversal symmetry breaking is associated with the vanadium Van Hove singularities at the onset of the charge density wave order. We also demonstrate the presence of fluctuations beyond the charge ordering temperature. Our results reveal that magnetic fields can be used as tuning knobs for disentangling intertwined orders in the momentum space for quantum materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.11341v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Topologically Protected Surface Altermagnetism on Antiferromagnets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10108</link><description>arXiv:2602.10108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnetism (AM) and its associated spin-transport phenomena are typically linked to spin-split electronic band structures in bulk materials. However, the crystal surface has a reduced symmetry with respect to the bulk, which can induce AM at the surface of conventional antiferromagnets (AFMs) $\unicode{x2013}$ a local effect which cannot be detected using bulk properties. In this work we define the symmetry conditions necessary for surface AM and show how it can be topologically protected, rendering it a robust effect. We provide a minimal model for one trivial and two topological examples of surface AM. We show that the spin spectral density, accessible by spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, can exhibit a $d$-wave-like altermagnetic character at the surface, even when the full band structure is completely spin degenerate. Our topological model describes the Dirac semimetal CuMnAs, which provides an existing realization of our theory. Our results identify crystal surfaces as a platform to realize robust, topology- and symmetry-driven unconventional magnetism beyond the bulk classification of magnetic materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.10108v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Two variants of the friendship paradox: The condition for inequality between them</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06176</link><description>arXiv:2511.06176v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The friendship paradox -- the observation that, on average, one's friends have more friends than oneself -- admits two common formulations depending on whether averaging is performed over edges or over nodes. These two definitions, the "alter-based" and "ego-based" means, are often treated as distinct but related quantities. This paper establishes their exact analytical relationship, showing that the difference between them is governed by the degree-degree covariance normalized by the mean degree. Explicit examples demonstrate the three possible cases of positive, zero, and negative covariance, corresponding respectively to assortative, neutral, and disassortative mixing patterns. The derivation further connects the covariance form to the moment-based expression introduced by Kumar, Krackhardt, and Feld [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 121, e2306412121 (2024)], which involves the (-1)st, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd moments of the degree distribution. The two formulations are shown to be equivalent, as they should be: the moment-based representation expands the same structural dependence that the covariance form expresses in its most compact and interpretable form. The analysis thus unifies node-level and moment-level perspectives on the friendship paradox, offering both a pedagogically transparent derivation and a direct bridge to recent theoretical developments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.06176v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Structural Theory of Information Backflow in Non-Markovian Relaxation: TC/TCL Formalism and Minimal Phase Diagrams</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09054</link><description>arXiv:2602.09054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a structural theory of information backflow in minimal non-Markovian relaxation processes within the framework of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. The approach is based on the time-convolution (TC) and time-convolutionless (TCL) projection-operator formalisms for reduced dynamics and on the doubling construction of non-equilibrium thermo field dynamics, which provides an embedding representation of dissipative evolution.
  We introduce a general backflow functional associated with a time-dependent information measure and derive generator-based sufficient conditions for the absence of backflow in terms of divisibility properties and effective relaxation rates. This allows a direct connection between memory kernels in generalized master equations and observable transient phenomena such as entropy overshoot and revival.
  Furthermore, we propose a decomposition of backflow into classical mixing and intrinsic contributions in the doubled representation, leading to a unified classification of transient regimes. Minimal classical and quantum two-state models are analyzed as analytically tractable examples, yielding explicit phase diagrams and recovering Mittag-Leffler-type fractional relaxation as a universal envelope of non-Markovian damping.
  The framework provides a constructive TC-to-TCL procedure for extracting effective rates and organizing memory-induced phenomena in a model-independent manner.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09054v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] ReLANCE: A Resource-Efficient Low-Latency Cortical Neural Acceleration Engine</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17392</link><description>arXiv:2510.17392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Cortical Neural Pool (CNP) architecture featuring a high-speed, resource-efficient CORDIC based Hodgkin-Huxley (RCHH) neuron model. Unlike shared CORDIC-based DNN approaches, the proposed neuron leverages modular and performance-optimised CORDIC stages with a latency-area trade-off. We introduce a novel Constraint-Aware Modular Parallelism (CAMP) with Precision &amp; Stability handling to leverage maximum speedup and utilisation of hardware through hardware software co-design. The FPGA implementation of the RCHH neuron shows 24.5% LUT reduction and 35.2% improved speed, compared to SoTA designs, with 70% better normalised root mean square error (NRMSE). Furthermore, the CNP exhibits 2.85x higher throughput (12.69 GOPS) than a functionally equivalent CORDIC-based DNN engine, with only a 0.35% accuracy drop relative to the DNN counterpart on the MNIST dataset. The overall results indicate that the design shows biologically accurate, low-resource spiking neural network implementations for resource-constrained edge AI applications. The reproducibility codes are publicly available at https://github.com/mukullokhande99/CNP RCHH, facilitating rapid integration and further development by researchers.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.17392v2</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Heritable changes in chromatin contacts associated with transgenerational susceptibility to diet-induced insulin dysregulation and obesity</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69214-5</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 12 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69214-5"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-69214-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Gestational exposure of mice to the obesogen tributyltin alters 3-D chromatin interactions in primordial germ cells leading to stable reduction of hepatic Ide expression and predisposing male descendants to insulin dysregulation and obesity.</description><author>Nature Communications</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69214-5</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Upon heating, the films undergo a discontinuous ferroelectric-to-paraelectric transition, during which partial relaxation is enabled by thermally active defect migration, likely associated with misfit dislocations. Upon cooling, the structure evolves relatively continuously, with &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; domains nucleating at the transition temperature to relieve anisotropic misfit strain, followed by gradual relaxation through domain wall evolution. These findings highlight the importance of determining the strain relaxation mediated by domain formation and, together with theoretical predictions, offer a framework for distinguishing strain–structure relationships in epitaxial thin films from those in bulk counterparts.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Materials Current Issue</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apm/article/14/2/021105/3379363/Revealing-intrinsic-strain-and-domain-evolution</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] NPC2 Suppresses Osteolytic Metastasis in Lung Adenocarcinoma via the AKT/mTOR Pathway and Tumor-Osteoclast Crosstalk</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00392-5?rss=yes</link><description>The lysosomal-related protein NPC2 affects the occurrence and development of tumors in terms of stemness, gene mutational burden and microsatellite instability of tumor cells. Here, combing with our previous scRNA-seq data, we identified the protective role of NPC2 in bone metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Bone metastases exhibited lower NPC2 expression compared to primary tumors, and low NPC2 expression was associated with poorer LUAD patient survival. NPC2 knockdown LUAD cells exhibited enhanced migration capability, and their supernatant accelerated the osteoclasts differentiation and maturation.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Thu,

Abstract: The rotational diffusion of a rigid spherical body decorated with dimers in an explicit fluid environment is reported. This model acts as a simplified representation of an enveloped virus bearing peplomers immersed in a coarse-grained fluid. Using dissipative particle dynamics, we explicitly study the hydrodynamic effects on the rotational diffusion of this virus-inspired particle subjected to oscillatory shear flow and confined between two solid-like surfaces. Since the rotational response depends on the type of imposed flow, we first characterize the oscillatory shear, identifying distinct flow regimes in terms of the so-called P\'eclet number, $Pe$. Our findings indicate that, under confinement, the rotational diffusivity is strongly modulated by the oscillatory flow amplitude and only weakly affected by the number of peplomers, since their effect is mainly determined by their dimeric structure and associated effective size. For high $Pe$, the rotational diffusion coefficient, $D_{r}$, tends to decrease as the number of peplomers ($N_{s}$) increases, whereas at low $Pe$, rotational diffusion becomes weakly dependent on the number of peplomers. However, at intermediate values of $Pe$, the interplay between oscillatory forcing and thermal fluctuations prevents the emergence of a clear trend between $D_{r}$ and $N_{s}$. Our results provide a clear picture of how, in confined environments, the interplay between fluid flow and thermal fluctuations affects the rotational diffusion of spiked particles, thereby helping to explain how fluid conditions can modify the alignment of peplomers with their potential targets.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09301v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Nodal-Surface and Flat-Band Driven Large Anomalous Nernst Effect in Epitaxial Ferromagnetic Weyl Metal Fe5Si3</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09460</link><description>arXiv:2602.09460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic topological materials such as Weyl and Dirac magnets exhibit unconventional electronic properties arising from the interplay between magnetic order and band topology, leading to remarkable thermomagnetic and thermoelectric effects. Here, we investigate the ANE in epitaxial thin films of the Weyl ferromagnet candidate Fe5Si3. A pronounced transverse Nernst response exceeding approximately 1.50 microvolt per kelvin is observed at room temperature, together with a giant anomalous Nernst angle of about 0.56, indicating highly efficient conversion between thermal gradients and transverse electric fields. Beyond the anomalous contribution, a sizable topological Nernst signal of approximately 0.43 microvolt per kelvin persists above room temperature, suggesting the possible presence of real-space Berry curvature associated with nontrivial spin textures. First-principles density functional theory calculations combined with symmetry analysis reveal an unconventional electronic structure in which Weyl nodal lines, nodal surfaces, and nearly flat bands coexist near the Fermi level. This rare concurrence of multiple topological band features produces a strongly enhanced and sharply energy-dependent Berry curvature, which governs both the magnitude and temperature evolution of the observed Nernst response. The close quantitative agreement between calculated anomalous Nernst conductivity and experimental results establishes the topological electronic structure as the dominant origin of the observed thermomagnetic transport, highlighting Fe5Si3 as a chemically simple, low-cost binary topological magnet for exploring both real-space and momentum-space Berry-curvature-driven thermoelectric phenomena.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09460v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Competing magnetic states in a non-coplanar Kagome magnet</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09479</link><description>arXiv:2602.09479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-collinear Kagome antiferromagnets (AFMs) Mn3X (X = Sn, Ga, Ge, Ir, Pt) can generate an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) despite vanishing net magnetization, enabled by broken time-reversal and inversion symmetries. However, strong in-plane anisotropy has limited studies of the AFM-AHE and electronic applications to coplanar spin configurations. Non-coplanar spin textures in these systems have been realized only in low temperature spin-glass states or at interfaces with heavy metals. Here, we report an intrinsic non-coplanar spin configuration persisting up to 400 K in cubic-phase Mn3Ge, originating from coexisting symmetric and antisymmetric exchange interactions. Competing magnetic states associated with this non-coplanar spin configuration give rise to an unconventional AHE with a magnetic-field-induced sign reversal and a hump-like feature. Our findings establish a platform for non-coplanar magnetism in AFM spintronics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09479v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Optical conductivity signatures of strong correlations and multiband superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09567</link><description>arXiv:2602.09567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the discovery of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates, there have been extensive efforts to unravel their electronic structure and pairing mechanism. In particular, understanding how the electronic structure evolves with doping is essential for clarifying theoretical models of superconductivity in nickelates. Here we present studies of the optical conductivity of Nd1-xSrxNiO2 thin films spanning the full phase diagram 0.025 &lt; x &lt; 0.30 using spectroscopic ellipsometry. The data are consistent with a two-band Drude model, which allows the decomposition of the intraband response into distinct contributions. One is from a "narrow" Drude term which we associate with electron bands, and the other a "broad" Drude term linked to the hole band with strong correlations. Increasing Sr doping leads to an expansion of the hole band spectral weight, and a corresponding reduction in the electron band, indicative of the multiband electronic structure and a doping-dependent reconstruction of the Fermi surface. Both doping and temperature-dependent optical spectra display significant spectral weight transfer from high to low energy, a hallmark of strong electronic correlations. In the superconducting state at optimal doping (x = 0.15), both electron and hole bands contribute to the superconducting condensate, signifying multiband superconductivity.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09567v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Pressure-induced superconductivity beyond magnetic quantum criticality in a Kondo ferromagnet</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09654</link><description>arXiv:2602.09654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions are an established setting for emergent phenomena driven by strong electronic correlations, including strange metals and unconventional superconductivity. These have been explored extensively in Kondo lattice materials tuned to an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point (QCP), but superconductivity emerging near ferromagnetic quantum criticality is not yet observed, and the conditions under which it occurs in proximity to ferromagnetism are undetermined. Here, we report a new setting for superconductivity in the ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice material Ce5CoGe2, where there is a ferromagnetic ground state at ambient pressure, which evolves to antiferromagnetism under applied pressures. The antiferromagnetic transition is suppressed to a zero-temperature QCP, which is accompanied by strange-metal behavior. Superconductivity does not occur at the QCP, but instead appears at pressures beyond the magnetic instability. These findings suggest that Ce5CoGe2 represents a distinct class of correlated materials exhibiting a unique scenario for the emergence of superconductivity, likely associated with unconventional pairing mechanisms beyond spin-fluctuations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09654v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Direct Visualization of Room-temperature Stair-stepped Quantum Spin Hall States in Bi4Br4</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09660</link><description>arXiv:2602.09660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological insulators host exotic quantum phenomena such as the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect, which enables dissipationless one-dimensional edge conduction. Realizing such states at room temperature and on a macroscopic scale is essential for energy-efficient electronics and quantum technologies, yet remains a fundamental challenge due to material limitations. Here, using microwave impedance microscopy, we directly visualize robust QSH states persisting up to 300 K in {\alpha}-Bi4Br4 nanowires. This stability and scalability are enabled by a stair stepped stacking configuration, a multilayer geometry in which QSH edge states from individual layers remain spatially decoupled. This configuration circumvents the stringent alignment and layer number constraints of previous proposals, allowing robust stair-stepped QSH (SS-QSH) conduction in structures several micrometers long and hundreds of nanometers high. Magnetic field and temperature dependent measurements confirm their intrinsic topological nature. Crucially, the SS-QSH and bulk signals scale with nanowire height, verifying the stair stepped origin. Our results are also successfully reproduced by finite-element analysis simulations. This work establishes {\alpha} Bi4Br4 as a practical platform for high temperature topological electronics and demonstrates a generalizable stacking strategy for designing scalable QSH systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09660v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Toroidal Confinement and Beyond: Vorticity-Defined Morphologies of Dipolar $^{164}$Dy Quantum Droplets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09683</link><description>arXiv:2602.09683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation, stability, and dynamics of 3D ring-shaped and multipole vortical quantum droplets (QDs) in non-rotating dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates held in a toroidal trapping potential. The QD dynamics are investigated in the framework of the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which includes long-range dipole-dipole interactions (DDI) and the beyond-mean-field Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) term, revealing the emergence of self-bound states. Stable stationary solutions for multipole QDs with different values of the topological charge (vorticity $S$) are shaped as necklace-like modes, with the number of \textquotedblleft beads" (multipole's order) $n=2S$, up to $S=6$. The stability area of the multipoles shrinks with the increase of $S$. For higher values of $S$ the centrifugal effect associated with the phase winding destabilizes the annular density and drives the formation of fragmented multipole droplet states. The dependence of the chemical potential, total energy and peak density on the norm (number of particles) and $S$ is produced. These findings uncover the stabilizing effect of the LHY correction and DDI anisotropy in maintaining complex QD states in the non-rotating configurations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09683v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Orbital piezomagnetic polarizability of pure insulating altermagnets in two dimensions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10076</link><description>arXiv:2602.10076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distinctive symmetry properties of pure altermagnets make them natural candidates for piezomagnetism. Previous work motivated by the piezomagnetic properties of altermagnets has primarily focused on the spin magnetization response to applied strain. In this paper we study orbital piezomagnetic effects--the orbital magnetization response to applied strain--in minimal lattice models of pure insulating altermagnets in two dimensions. We obtain general microscopic expressions for the orbital magnetization in the presence of strain, as well as the orbital piezomagnetic polarizability, i.e., the defining response characteristic of pure altermagnets. We apply these expressions to three specific tetragonal lattice models, two corresponding to $d$-wave altermagnets and one describing a $g$-wave altermagnet. Whereas the $d$-wave altermagnets are associated with a linear piezomagnetic polarizability, the $g$-wave altermagnet exhibits a nonlinear piezomagnetic effect. Our analysis reveals how the polarizabilities are related to and determined by the Berry curvature of the occupied bands. Connections to materials of current interest are discussed.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.10076v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Topologically Protected Surface Altermagnetism on Antiferromagnets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10108</link><description>arXiv:2602.10108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism (AM) and its associated spin-transport phenomena are typically linked to spin-split electronic band structures in bulk materials. However, the crystal surface has a reduced symmetry with respect to the bulk, which can induce AM at the surface of conventional antiferromagnets (AFMs) -- a local effect which cannot be detected using bulk properties. In this work we define the symmetry conditions necessary for surface AM and show how it can be topologically protected, rendering it a robust effect. We provide a minimal model for one trivial and two topological examples of surface AM. We show that the spin spectral density, accessible by spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, can exhibit a $d$-wave-like altermagnetic character at the surface, even when the full band structure is completely spin degenerate. Our topological model describes the Dirac semimetal CuMnAs, which provides an existing realization of our theory. Our results identify crystal surfaces as a platform to realize robust, topology- and symmetry-driven unconventional magnetism beyond the bulk classification of magnetic materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.10108v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] TC/TCL and NETFD Correspondence Principles for Information Backflow: A Structural Monotonicity Theorem and Minimal Phase Diagrams</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09054</link><description>arXiv:2602.09054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a unified structural framework for information backflow in minimal non-Markovian relaxation processes. The central idea is to interpret non-Markovianity as an embedding phenomenon in which observable degrees of freedom exchange information with hidden auxiliary sectors. Our approach is based on two standard formalisms in nonequilibrium physics: (i) the time-convolution (TC) and time-convolutionless (TCL) projection-operator master equations, and (ii) the correspondence principle of non-equilibrium thermo field dynamics (NETFD), which provides a doubling construction equivalent to an embedding of density-operator dynamics into a vector evolution in an enlarged space. We define a general information-backflow functional N_I associated with an information quantity I(t) and derive sufficient conditions for the absence of backflow (N_I = 0) in terms of divisibility properties of the instantaneous TCL generator. We further introduce a decomposition of backflow into classical and intrinsic thermo-field entanglement contributions, leading to a classification of transient overshoot and revival phenomena in a model-independent manner. Minimal classical and quantum two-state models are discussed as analytically tractable examples, recovering Mittag-Leffler fractional relaxation as a universal envelope. We also provide a constructive TC-to-TCL algorithm for extracting effective rates and producing phase diagrams of backflow.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09054v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Volume-law protection of metrological advantage</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09086</link><description>arXiv:2602.09086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although entanglement can boost metrological precision beyond the standard quantum limit, the advantage often disappears with particle loss. We demonstrate that scrambling safeguards precision by dispersing information about the encoded parameter into many-body correlations. For Haar-random scrambling unitaries, we derive exact formulas for the average quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the reduced state after tracing out lost particles. The result exhibits a threshold; any remaining subsystem larger than $N/2$ recovers the full QFI, while smaller subsystems contain negligible information. We link this threshold to the scrambling-induced transition from area-law to volume-law entanglement and the associated growth of the Schmidt rank. We outline two realizations -- a brickwork circuit and chaotic XX-chain evolution -- and demonstrate the protection of one-axis-twisted probes against the loss of up to half of the particles.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09086v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Topology and higher-order global synchronization on directed and hollow simplicial and cell complexes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09715</link><description>arXiv:2602.09715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order networks encode the many-body interactions of complex systems ranging from the brain to biological transportation networks. Simplicial and cell complexes are ideal higher-order network representations for investigating higher-order topological dynamics where dynamical variables are not only associated with nodes, but also with edges, triangles, and higher-order simplices and cells. Global Topological Synchronization (GTS) refers to the dynamical state in which identical oscillators associated with higher-dimensional simplices and cells oscillate in unison. On standard unweighted and undirected complexes this dynamical state can be achieved only under strict topological and combinatorial conditions on the underlying discrete support. In this work we consider generalized higher-order network representations including directed and hollow complexes. Based on an in depth investigation of their topology defined by their associated algebraic topology operators and Betti numbers, we determine under which conditions GTS can be observed. We show that directed complexes always admit a global topological synchronization state independently of their topology and structure. However, we demonstrate that for directed complexes this dynamical state cannot be asymptotically stable. While hollow complexes require more stringent topological conditions to sustain global topological synchronization, these topologies can favor both the existence and the stability of global topological synchronization with respect to undirected and unweighted complexes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09715v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Symmetric preferences, asymmetric outcomes: Tipping dynamics in an open-city segregation model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09795</link><description>arXiv:2602.09795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schelling's model of segregation demonstrates that even in the absence of social or governmental interventions, individuals with mild in-group preferences can self-organize into strongly segregated neighborhoods. Many variants of this celebrated model have been proposed by assuming agents tend to increase their satisfaction. Complementary to this traditional, utility-based approach, we model residential moves using satisfaction-independent reaction rates in a spatially extended chemical reaction network. The resulting model exhibits a counter-intuitive phenomenon: despite symmetric in-group preferences, the system undergoes a tipping transition at a critical preference level, beyond which one agent type dominates. We characterize this asymmetric phase transition in details using mean-field analysis, numerical simulations and finite size scaling methods. We find that while the transition shares key features with the Ising universality class, such as $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking and similar exponent ratios, the full set of critical exponents does not match any known universality class.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09795v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Framework for (non-)adiabatic chiral state conversion: from non-Hermitian Hamiltonians to Liouvillians</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09881</link><description>arXiv:2602.09881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adiabatic chiral state conversion (CSC) is one of the many counterintuitive effects associated with non-Hermitian physics. In quantum systems, numerous works have demonstrated this phenomenon under both non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and Lindblad evolution. However, despite considerable progress, the physical mechanism behind it has been a subject of debate. In this work, we present a unified framework that explains CSC in any non-Hermitian system, encompassing non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, Lindblad, and hybrid settings. Our framework relies on perturbative, non-adiabatic corrections to adiabatic evolution and consistently predicts CSC with only the lowest-order corrections. We demonstrate its efficacy with models of single and coupled dissipative qubits, obtaining analytical solutions for the conversion fidelity. Our analysis further reveals the role of non-perturbative dynamics, which can be present even in apparently slow trajectories. We show that this property can be utilised to considerably enhance state conversion. Finally, we demonstrate that CSC can be observed in a model without the presence of exceptional points.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09881v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Intermediate scattering function of a gravitactic circle swimmer</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15192</link><description>arXiv:2411.15192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze gravitaxis of a Brownian circle swimmer by deriving and characterizing analytically the experimentally measurable intermediate scattering function (ISF). To solve the associated Fokker-Planck equation we use a spectral-theory approach and find formal expressions in terms of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the overdamped-noisy-driven-pendulum problem. We further perform a Taylor series of the ISF in the wavevector to read off the cumulants up to the fourth order. We focus on the skewness and kurtosis analyzed for four observation directions in the 2D-plane. Validating our findings involves conducting Langevin-dynamics simulations and interpreting the results using a harmonic approximation. The skewness and kurtosis are amplified as the orienting torque approaches the intrinsic angular drift of the circle swimmer from above, highlighting deviations from Gaussian behavior. Transforming the ISF to the comoving frame, again a measurable quantity, reveals gravitactic effects and diverse behaviors spanning from diffusive motion at low wavenumbers to circular motion at intermediate and directed motion at higher wavenumbers.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.15192v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Rare Trajectories in a Prototypical Mean-field Disordered Model: Insights into Landscape and Instantons</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00107</link><description>arXiv:2505.00107v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For disordered systems within the random first-order transition (RFOT) universality class, such as structural glasses and certain spin glasses, the role played by activated relaxation processes is rich to the point of perplexity. Over the last decades, various efforts have attempted to formalize and systematize such processes in terms of instantons similar to the nucleation droplets of first-order phase transitions. In particular, Kirkpatrick, Thirumalai, and Wolynes proposed in the late '80s an influential nucleation theory of relaxation in structural glasses. Already within this picture, however, the resulting structures are far from the compact objects expected from the classical droplet description. In addition, an altogether different type of single-particle hopping-like instantons has recently been isolated in molecular simulations. Landscape studies of mean-field spin glass models have further revealed that simple saddle crossing does not capture relaxation in these systems. We present here a landscape-agnostic study of rare dynamical events, which delineates the richness of instantons in these systems. Our work not only captures the structure of metastable states, but also identifies the point of irreversibility, beyond which activated relaxation processes become a fait accompli. An interpretation of the associated landscape features is articulated, thus charting a path toward a complete understanding of RFOT instantons.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.00107v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Magnetic-Field-Induced Geometric Response of Mean-Field Projectors: Streda Formula and Orbital Magnetization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07001</link><description>arXiv:2510.07001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the magnetic-field response of interacting electron systems within mean-field theory using perturbation theory. We show that the linear response of the mean-field density-matrix to a weak magnetic field is purely geometric: it depends only on wavefunction derivatives, the Berry connections linking the occupied and unoccupied subspaces, and is independent of the interaction potential and the quasiparticle dispersion. This leads to compact, gauge-invariant projector expressions for both the St\v{r}eda formula and the formula for orbital magnetization. Our calculation explicitly elucidates the role of exchange and self-consistency in defining current vertices for orbital magnetization calculations. Our work establishes a direct connection between mean-field theory, quantum geometry and the non-interacting topological band theory.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.07001v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The impact of spurious imaginary phonon modes on thermal properties of Metal-organic Frameworks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07295</link><description>arXiv:2602.07295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metal-organic Frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as potential candidates for direct air capture (DAC) of green house gases and water. Thermal properties of MOFs, such as their heat capacity, are used to determine the energy penalty associated with the adsorbent retrieval during the Temperature Swing Adsorption process. To aid exploration of the vast experimental design space of MOFs for such applications, computational methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT) or surrogate machine learning models trained on DFT data have been developed for obtaining phonon-derived heat capacities of MOFs. However, the high cost of explicit phonon computation in large and flexible nanoporous MOFs often necessitates the use of small supercells or lower convergence criteria which decrease predictive accuracy. These approximations often result in spurious imaginary phonon modes which are commonly ignored in practice. At present, there is no clear consensus in the literature on what magnitude of negative frequency or what fraction of imaginary modes can be considered acceptable. Here, we systematically demonstrate that spurious imaginary phonon modes can introduce substantial errors in heat capacity estimates, leading to incorrect ranking of MOFs in thermal-property-based screening. We further show that benchmarking machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) against DFT datasets containing spurious imaginary modes can misrepresent models that predict physically meaningful phonon spectra for dynamically stable MOFs. Finally, we introduce a simple, rapid post-processing workflow that can be applied to standard phonon calculations to effectively correct heat capacity estimates and account for spurious imaginary modes in MOFs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.07295v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum metrology through spectral measurements in quantum optics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04300</link><description>arXiv:2509.04300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuously monitored quantum systems are emerging as promising platforms for quantum metrology, where a central challenge is to identify measurement strategies that optimally extract information about unknown parameters encoded in the complex quantum state of emitted radiation. Different measurement strategies effectively access distinct temporal modes of the emitted field, and the resulting choice of mode can strongly impact the information available for parameter estimation. While a ubiquitous approach in quantum optics is to select frequency modes through spectral filtering, the metrological potential of this technique has not yet been systematically quantified. We develop a theoretical framework to assess this potential by modeling spectral detection as a cascaded quantum system, allowing us to reconstruct the full density matrix of frequency-filtered photonic modes and to compute their associated Fisher information. This framework provides a minimal yet general method to benchmark the performance of spectral measurements in quantum optics, allowing to identify optimal filtering strategies in terms of frequency selection, detector linewidth, and metrological gain accessible through higher-order frequency-resolved correlations and mean-field engineering. These results lay the groundwork for identifying and designing optimal sensing strategies in practical quantum-optical platforms.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.04300v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Accelerating Post-Quantum Cryptography via LLM-Driven Hardware-Software Co-Design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09410</link><description>arXiv:2602.09410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is crucial for securing data against emerging quantum threats. However, its algorithms are computationally complex and difficult to implement efficiently on hardware. In this paper, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate the hardware-software co-design process for PQC, with a focus on the FALCON digital signature scheme. We present a novel framework that leverages LLMs to analyze PQC algorithms, identify performance-critical components, and generate candidate hardware descriptions for FPGA implementation. We present the first quantitative comparison between LLM-driven synthesis and conventional HLS-based approaches for low-level compute-intensive kernels in FALCON, showing that human-in-the-loop LLM-generated accelerators can achieve up to 2.6x speedup in kernel execution time with shorter critical paths, while highlighting trade-offs in resource utilization and power consumption. Our results suggest that LLMs can minimize design effort and development time by automating FPGA accelerator design iterations for PQC algorithms, offering a promising new direction for rapid and adaptive PQC accelerator design on FPGAs.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09410v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Development of an Energy-Efficient and Real-Time Data Movement Strategy for Next-Generation Heterogeneous Mixed-Criticality Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09554</link><description>arXiv:2602.09554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial domains such as automotive, robotics, and aerospace are rapidly evolving to satisfy the increasing demand for machine-learning-driven Autonomy, Connectivity, Electrification, and Shared mobility (ACES). This paradigm shift inherently and significantly increases the requirement for onboard computing performance and high-performance communication infrastructure. At the same time, Moore's Law and Dennard Scaling are grinding to a halt, in turn, driving computing systems to larger scales and higher levels of heterogeneity and specialization, through application-specific hardware accelerators, instead of relying on technological scaling only. Approaching ACES requires this substantial amount of compute at an increasingly high energy-efficiency, since most use cases are fundamentally resource-bound. This increase in compute performance and heterogeneity goes hand in hand with a growing demand for high memory bandwidth and capacity as the driving applications grow in complexity, operating on huge and progressively irregular data sets and further requiring a steady influx of sensor data, increasing pressure both on on-chip and off-chip interconnect systems. Further, ACES combines real-time time-critical with general compute tasks on the same physical platform, sharing communication, storage, and micro-architectural resources. These heterogeneous mixed-criticality systems (MCSs) place additional pressure on the interconnect, demanding minimal contention between the different criticality levels to sustain a high degree of predictability. Fulfilling the performance and energy-efficiency requirements across a wide range of industrial applications requires a carefully co-designed process of the memory system with the use cases as well as the compute units and accelerators.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09554v1</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Catalysis] Direct synthesis of phenyl isocyanate by carbonylation of nitrobenzene, catalyzed by palladium/phenanthroline complexes: promoting effect of phosphorus acids</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021951726000874?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: Available online 9 February 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of Catalysis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Doaa R.

T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data from UK Biobank (UKB) participants were utilized to develop a Three-Dimensional Vision Transformer (3D-ViT) model for predicting brain age and computing BAG, an imaging-derived indicator of biological aging. Causal BAG-CVD relationships were assessed through bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR). The results substantiated significant brain-heart interactions, revealing that Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) and Chronic Ischaemic Heart Disease (CIH) were associated with decelerated brain aging (OR=0.783; OR=0.847), while an elevated BAG correlated with a reduced risk of AMI and CIH (OR=0.954; OR=0.969).</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00362-7?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Parallel processing of distinct facial signals for the rapid evaluation of social agents.</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00353-6?rss=yes</link><description>The distributed model of primate face perception proposes that distinct facial signals, such as emotional valence and sex, are processed by separate neural mechanisms. A key prediction is that cues about a face’s emotion and sex are extracted at different processing stages. To test this, we decoded time-resolved patterns of brain activity evoked by a large set of unfamiliar, naturalistic faces. Behavioural ratings were first collected to characterise the perceived emotional valence and sex of 900 faces.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00353-6?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Foraging theory, which is rooted in ecology and evolutionary theory, has helped advance this pursuit but has largely focused on individual decision-making processes. In this article, we extend beyond individual agents and propose social foraging as a promising avenue to study social decisions. We synthesize key socio-cognitive elements of social interactions that are particularly amenable to study through foraging paradigms, such as social inference, coordination and collective behavior, especially in humans.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid

Abstract: Metal-organic Frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as potential candidates for direct air capture (DAC) of green house gases and water. Thermal properties of MOFs, such as their heat capacity, are used to determine the energy penalty associated with the adsorbent retrieval during the Temperature Swing Adsorption process. To aid exploration of the vast experimental design space of MOFs for such applications, computational methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT) or surrogate machine learning models trained on DFT data have been developed for obtaining phonon-derived heat capacities of MOFs. However, the high cost of explicit phonon computation in large and flexible nanoporous MOFs often necessitates the use of small supercells or lower convergence criteria which decrease predictive accuracy. These approximations often result in spurious imaginary phonon modes which are commonly ignored in practice. At present, there is no clear consensus in the literature on what magnitude of negative frequency or what fraction of imaginary modes can be considered acceptable. Here, we systematically demonstrate that spurious imaginary phonon modes can introduce substantial errors in heat capacity estimates, leading to incorrect ranking of MOFs in thermal-property-based screening. We further show that benchmarking machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) against DFT datasets containing spurious imaginary modes can misrepresent models that predict physically meaningful phonon spectra for dynamically stable MOFs. Finally, we introduce a simple, rapid post-processing workflow that can be applied to standard phonon calculations to effectively correct heat capacity estimates and account for spurious imaginary modes in MOFs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.07295v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Theory of Integer Quantum Hall Effect in Irrational Magnetic Field</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07461</link><description>arXiv:2602.07461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conventional theory of the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) fails for irrational magnetic fields owing to the breakdown of magnetic translational symmetry. Here, based on the recently proposed incommensurate energy band (IEB) theory, we present a universal IQHE theory that does not rely on magnetic translation symmetry and is applicable to both rational and irrational magnetic fluxes. Using the square lattice as a paradigmatic example, we first show that the IEB framework provides a superior description of its energy spectrum in a magnetic field, as it explicitly reveals the momentum-space distribution of eigenstates. Key to our IQHE theory is that each gap in the IEB spectrum is intrinsically labeled by an integer pair (m,g), defined by the corresponding Bragg planes. When the Fermi energy lies within such a gap, the occupied electron states $N_{\text{occ}}$ is determined by the k-space volume enclosed by these Bragg planes, leading to the fundamental relation $N_{\text{occ}}/N_0 = m(\phi/\phi_0) + g$. Through St\v{r}eda formula, this leads directly to the quantized Hall conductance $\sigma_{xy} = m e^2/h$ under arbitrary magnetic fields. Our work resolves the long-standing problem of IQHE under irrational flux, and establishes a new paradigm for IQHE.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.07461v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Yielding behaviour of glasses under shear deformation at constant pressure</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07650</link><description>arXiv:2602.07650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer simulations of yielding of glasses under shear have typically been performed under constant volume, strain controlled protocols. However, volumetric effects, such as the dilatancy associated with plastic rearrangements, and the observed reduction of density in shear bands, make it interesting to consider constant pressure shear protocols. We present a computational investigation on the nature of yielding of glasses under constant-pressure conditions, for different pressures. For uniform shear, the stress-strain curves at different pressures differ only by the stress scale. We find stable shear bands under cyclic shear whose steady-state width increases with an increase in external pressure, with density within shear bands being lower compared to the average values reached. Cyclically sheared well annealed glasses yield with a discontinuous dilation at the yield point, whereas the poorly annealed glasses undergo compaction before yielding accompanied by dilation. The external pressure influences the quantitative mechanical response of the glasses, but the qualitative behaviour is similar at different pressures, and remains the same as that of yielding at the constant-volume strain-controlled conditions. We discuss directions along with further investigations may be pursued, based on the results presented.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.07650v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Engineering a Bound State in the Continuum via Quantum Interference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07809</link><description>arXiv:2602.07809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanical interaction potentials typically support either localized bound states below the dissociation threshold or delocalized scattering states above it. While bound states are energetically isolated, scattering states embed a quantum system in a continuum of environmental modes, making dissipation and loss intrisic features of open quantum systems. A striking exception are bound states in the continuum (BICs), which remain localized despite lying within the scattering continuum due to destructive interference. It was predicted that such states can arise from the interference of two Feshbach resonances coupled to a common continuum, yet this mechanism has remained experimentally inaccessible in genuine quantum systems. Here we demonstrate the formation of such an interference-stabilized state in ultracold collisions of ${}^6$Li atoms by coherently coupling two tunable Feshbach resonances using Floquet engineering. At a critical parameter point, both elastic and inelastic coupling to the continuum vanish, yielding a molecular state above the dissociation threshold. Loss spectroscopy, quench dynamics, and rf-photoassociation directly reveal the resulting decoupling from scattering states. Our observations are quantitatively captured by full coupled-channel calculations and a minimal non-Hermitian model, identifying a Friedrich-Wintgen BIC. Our results establish quantum interference as a powerful mechanism for controlling openness in quantum matter and for engineering non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.07809v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Epitaxial lift-off of La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ membranes enabled by BaO sacrificial layers and restoration of the Curie temperature</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07831</link><description>arXiv:2602.07831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrathin complex-oxide membranes provide a powerful platform for strain engineering, interfacial control, and heterogeneous integration; however, their formation remains constrained by the availability and performance of suitable water-soluble sacrificial layers. This letter demonstrates that barium oxide (BaO) serves as a highly efficient and rapidly dissolving water-soluble sacrificial layer, enabling the epitaxial lift-off and transfer of ultrathin La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO) membranes onto SiO$_x$/Si substrates. LSMO membranes with a thickness of approximately 8 nm are released using a BaO sacrificial layer grown by molecular beam epitaxy, while high crystallinity is preserved and Ba interdiffusion is limited to a narrow interfacial region of approximately 0.5 nm. Post-transfer oxygen annealing at 600 ${}^\circ$C increases the Curie temperature ($T_C$) from 342 K to 346 K by eliminating Mn$^{2+}$ states associated with oxygen vacancies generated through oxygen extraction into the BaO layer. These results show that BaO provides a fast, scalable, and compositionally simple route for complex-oxide membrane release, while brief oxygen annealing is essential to restore the optimal Mn valence state and achieve the intrinsic high $T_C$.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.07831v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Direct Evidence of a Near-Ideal Jeff = 1/2 Ground State in Triangular-Lattice Na2BaCo(PO4)2</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08361</link><description>arXiv:2602.08361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the local Co 3d electronic structure of Na2BaCo(PO4)2 using polarization-dependent X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) in combination with full multiplet cluster calculations. We employed the line-fitting inverse partial fluorescence yield (IPFY) technique to obtain accurate XAS spectra from strong insulating materials. Our combined experimental and theoretical analysis reveals a very small effective trigonal distortion of only 11 meV in the CoO6 octahedra, indicating a close to ideal condition to render a ground state with the Jeff = 1/2 character. With our cluster model we were also able to simulate magnetic susceptibility measurements along different directions in the crystal. These findings highlight Na2BaCo(PO4)2 as a promising platform for exploring exotic magnetic phenomena associated with Jeff = 1/2 ground states on triangular lattices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.08361v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Precipitation induced recrystallisation (PIX) in a Ti-Fe-Mo bcc-superalloy driven by lattice misfit</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08572</link><description>arXiv:2602.08572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beta-Ti bcc-superalloys, comprising an A2 beta-Ti matrix reinforced by ordered intermetallic B2 beta-prime-TiFe precipitates, exhibit an unusual recrystallisation that occurs with no externally applied strain (i.e. no thermomechanical processing). Thermal ageing at 750 degrees Celsius for 72 h results in refinement of the grain size from 364 um to 30 um. This grain refinement is driven by discontinuous precipitation of beta-prime-TiFe lamellae with the beta-Ti matrix from grain/phase boundaries, which is associated with significant misorientation and increased dislocation density, attributed as precipitation induced recrystallisation (PIX).</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.08572v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Equilibrium-like statistical mechanics in space-time for a deterministic traffic model far from equilibrium</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08991</link><description>arXiv:2602.08991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by earlier numerical evidence for a percolation-like transition in space-time jamming, we present an analytic description of the transient dynamics of the deterministic traffic model elementary cellular automaton rule 184 (ECA184). By exploiting the deterministic structure of the dynamics, we reformulate the problem in terms of a height function constructed directly from the initial condition, and obtain an equilibrium statistical mechanics-like description over the lattice configurations. This formulation allows macroscopic observables in space-time, such as the total jam delay and jam relaxation time, as well as microscopic jam statistics, to be expressed in terms of geometric properties of the height function. We thereby derive the associated scaling forms and recover the critical exponents previously observed in numerical studies. We discuss the physical implications of this space-time geometric approach.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.08991v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] High-resolution numerical simulations of turbulent non-catalytic reverse water gas shift</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08365</link><description>arXiv:2602.08365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A green transition in aviation requires a drastic upscaling of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The power-to-liquid process for the production of CO2-neutral jet fuel via electricity, called e-SAF, directly replaces fossil jet fuel without having to change infrastructure, aeroplanes, or jet-engines. The process combines green hydrogen with industrial exhaust gas, or captured carbon dioxide, in a circular economy concept. A key element of the e-SAF production plant is the reactor where syngas is produced. Traditional reactors use catalytic technology, which faces severe challenges due to the reduced performance over time because of catalyst degradation, clogging, and breakup due to embrittlement. A high-potential alternative is the catalyst-free reverse water-gas-shift (RWGS) reactor concept.
  The primary aim of this paper is to investigate the fundamental aspects of the catalyst-free RWGS process, such as reaction kinetics and the interactions between turbulence and chemistry. The secondary aim is to identify how a typical combustion subgrid scale models for Large Eddy Simulations (LES) perform when the chemical reactions are endothermic, in contrast to the strong endothermicity associated with classical combustion.
  It is found that even small traces of O2 in the CO2 stream can significantly increase the production rate of CO. This is attributed to the increased pool of OH. The effect is strongest at atmospheric pressure and less pronounced at higher pressure. By using the temporal jet framework to study turbulence-chemistry interactions, an algebraic equation for the prediction of the CO conversion time in a turbulent flow as a function of Damkohler number and chemical timescale is employed. Finally, it is concluded that the PaSR LES subgrid model designed for combustion reactions perform well also for the endothermic reverse water-gas-shift reaction.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.08365v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Non-Hermitian Renormalization Group from a Few-Body Perspective</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08705</link><description>arXiv:2602.08705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity plays a fundamental role in open quantum systems and describes a wide variety of effects of interactions with environments, including quantum measurement. However, understanding its consequences in strongly interacting systems is still elusive due to the interplay between non-perturbative strong correlations and non-Hermiticity. While the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) method has been applied to tackle this problem, its foundation, based on the existence of the partition function, is ill-defined. In this paper, we establish a microscopic foundation of the non-Hermitian RG method from a few-body perspective. We show that the invariance of the scattering amplitude under RG transformations enables us to rigorously derive the non-Hermitian RG equation, giving a physically transparent interpretation of RG flows. We discuss a detailed structure of such RG flows in a non-relativistic two-body system with inelastic two-body loss, and show its relation to a non-Hermitian quantum scale anomaly. Our analysis suggests that non-Hermitian complex potentials often used in high-energy physics can be interpreted as being caused by quantum measurement, where the detection of elastically scattered particles updates the observer's knowledge, resulting in a nonunitary state change of the system. We apply our formalism to nuclear physics, find the emergence of a critical semicircle, and show that several nuclei are located near the critical semicircle in the coherent neutron-nucleus scattering. We also propose that the localized dineutron in two-neutron halo nuclei can be interpreted as the quantum measurement effect on the imaginary potential associated with absorption into the core nucleus. Our result bridges different contexts of non-Hermitian systems in high-energy and atomic, molecular, and optical physics, opening an interdisciplinary playground of non-Hermitian few-body physics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.08705v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Higher-order Hall response arises from octupole order and scalar spin chirality in a noncollinear antiferromagnet</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10747</link><description>arXiv:2304.10747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noncollinear antiferromagnets can generate a transverse electrical response known as the anomalous Hall effect, even though they possess almost no net magnetization. The microscopic origin of this behaviour, however, has remained unclear because conventional measurement geometries mix different contributions to the measured response. Here, we show that applying magnetic fields in selected in-plane directions allows us to disentangle the mechanisms underlying the Hall effect in a representative noncollinear antiferromagnet. By suppressing any dipole-related signal, we isolate a purely octupole-driven Hall response that exhibits a characteristic three-fold angular symmetry. At low magnetic fields, we further observe an additional Hall-like contribution that arises from the scalar spin chirality associated with noncoplanar spin textures. Combining symmetry analysis, first-principles calculations, and transport measurements, we reveal that octupole order, dipole moments, and chirality coexist and contribute in distinct field regimes. These findings establish a framework for identifying and controlling complex magnetic order parameters for spintronic applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2304.10747v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Break-down of the relationship between {\alpha}-relaxation and equilibration in hydrostatically compressed metallic glasses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13636</link><description>arXiv:2409.13636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Glasses encode the memory of any thermo-mechanical treatment applied to them. This ability is associated to the existence of a myriad of metastable amorphous states which can be probed through different experimental pathways. It is usually assumed that this memory can be erased in the supercooled liquid, and that this process occurs on a time scale controlled by the {\alpha}-relaxation. We find that this assumption does not apply for hydrostatically compressed glasses. Annealing under pressure a prototypical metallic glass can irreversibly modify its dynamics, thermodynamics and structure, reduce the atomic mobility and lead to structural modifications of the first coordination shells which reduce the thermal stability with respect to a glass annealed in absence of pressure. When heated above their glass transition temperature, these compressed glasses do not convert into the pristine supercooled liquid, implying the existence of an additional process, beyond the {\alpha}-relaxation, contributing to the equilibrium recovery of the material. These results establish pressure as a powerful tool for engineering non-equilibrium glassy materials with tailored properties, while deepening our understanding of relaxation dynamics in disordered systems under extreme conditions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2409.13636v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Susceptibility for extremely low external fluctuations and critical behaviour of Greenberg-Hastings neuronal model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22629</link><description>arXiv:2506.22629v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the scaling behaviour of the fluctuation susceptibility associated with the average activation in the Greenberg-Hastings neural network model and its relation to microscopic spontaneous activation. We found that, as the spontaneous activation probability tends to zero, a clear finite size scaling behaviour in the susceptibility emerges, characterized by critical exponents which follow already known scaling laws. This shows that the spontaneous activation probability plays the role of an external field conjugated to the order parameter of the dynamical activation transition. The roles of different kinds of activation mechanisms around the different dynamical phase transitions exhibited by the model are characterized numerically and using a mean field approximation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.22629v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Fluctuation-induced giant magnetoresistance in charge-neutral graphene</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09988</link><description>arXiv:2512.09988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Johnson-Nyquist noise associated with the intrinsic conductivity of the electron liquid, induces fluctuations of the electron density in charge-neutral graphene devices. In the presence of external electric and magnetic fields, the fluctuations of charge density and electric current induce a fluctuating hydrodynamic flow. We show that the resulting advection of charge produces a fluctuation contribution to the macroscopic conductivity of the system, $\sigma_{\mathrm{fl}}$, and develop a quantitative theory of $\sigma_{\mathrm{fl}}$. At zero magnetic field, $\sigma_{\mathrm{fl}}$ diverges logarithmically with the system size and becomes rapidly suppressed at relatively small fields. This results in giant magnetoresistance of the system.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.09988v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Non-Universality from Conserved Superoperators in Unitary Circuits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11407</link><description>arXiv:2409.11407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important result in the theory of quantum control is the "universality" of $2$-local unitary gates, i.e. the fact that any global unitary evolution of a system of $L$ qudits can be implemented by composition of $2$-local unitary gates. Surprisingly, recent results have shown that universality can break down in the presence of symmetries: in general, not all globally symmetric unitaries can be constructed using $k$-local symmetric unitary gates. This also restricts the dynamics that can be implemented by symmetric local Hamiltonians. In this paper, we show that obstructions to universality in such settings can in general be understood in terms of superoperator symmetries associated with unitary evolution by restricted sets of gates. These superoperator symmetries lead to block decompositions of the operator Hilbert space, which dictate the connectivity of operator space, and hence the structure of the dynamical Lie algebra. We demonstrate this explicitly in several examples by systematically deriving the superoperator symmetries from the gate structure using the framework of commutant algebras, which has been used to systematically derive symmetries in other quantum many-body systems. We clearly delineate two different types of non-universality, which stem from different structures of the superoperator symmetries, and discuss its signatures in physical observables. In all, our work establishes a comprehensive framework to explore the universality of unitary circuits and derive physical consequences of its absence.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2409.11407v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Uncertainty Principle from Operator Asymmetry</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06760</link><description>arXiv:2509.06760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The uncertainty principle is fundamentally rooted in the algebraic asymmetry between observables. We introduce a new class of uncertainty relations grounded in the resource theory of asymmetry, where incompatibility is quantified by an observable's intrinsic, state-independent capacity to break the symmetry associated with another. This ``operator asymmetry,'' formalized as the incompatibility norm, leads to a variance-based uncertainty relation for pure states that can be tighter than the standard Robertson bound. Most significantly, this framework resolves a long-standing open problem in quantum information theory: the formulation of a universally valid, product-form uncertainty relation for the Wigner-Yanase skew information. We demonstrate the practical power of our framework by deriving tighter quantum speed limits for the dynamics of nearly conserved quantities, which are crucial for understanding non-equilibrium phenomena such as prethermalization and many-body localization. This work provides both a new conceptual lens for understanding quantum uncertainty and a powerful, versatile toolkit for its application.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.06760v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Short-term plasticity recalls forgotten memories through a trampoline mechanism</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22848</link><description>arXiv:2511.22848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze continuous Hopfield associative memories augmented by additional, rapid short-term associative synaptic plasticity. Through the cavity method, we determine the boundary between the retrieval and forgetting, or spin-glass phase, of the network as a function of the fraction of stored memories and the neuronal gain. We find that short-term synaptic plasticity yields marginal improvements in critical memory capacity. However, through dynamical mean field theory, backed by extensive numerical simulations, we find that short-term synaptic plasticity has a dramatic impact on memory retrieval above the critical capacity. When short-term synaptic plasticity is turned on, the combined neuronal and synaptic dynamics descends a high-dimensional energy landscape over both neurons and synapses. The energy landscape over neurons alone is thus dynamic, and is lowered in the vicinity of recent neuronal patterns visited by the network, just like the surface of a trampoline is lowered in the vicinity of regions recently visited by a heavy ball. This trampoline-like reactivity of the neuronal energy landscape to short-term plasticity in synapses can lead to the recall of stored memories that would otherwise have been forgotten. This occurs because the dynamics without short-term plasticity transiently moves towards a stored memory before departing away from it. Thus short-term plasticity, operating during the transient, lowers the energy in the vicinity of the stored memory, eventually trapping the combined neuronal and synaptic dynamics at a fixed point close to the stored memory. In this manner, short-term plasticity enables the recall of memories that would otherwise be forgotten, by trapping transients that would otherwise escape. We furthermore find an optimal time constant for short-term synaptic plasticity, matched to the transient dynamics, to empower recall of forgotten memories.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.22848v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Deep learning of committor for ion dissociation and interpretable analysis of solvent effects using atom-centered symmetry functions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09468</link><description>arXiv:2512.09468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The association and dissociation of ion pairs in water are fundamental to physical chemistry, yet their reaction coordinates are complex, involving not only interionic distance but also solvent-mediated hydration structures. These processes are often represented by free-energy landscapes constructed from collective variables (CVs), such as interionic distance and water bridging structures; however, it remains uncertain whether such representations reliably capture the transition pathways between the two associated and dissociated states. In this study, we employ deep learning to identify reaction coordinates for NaCl ion pair association and dissociation in water, using the committor as a quantitative measure of progress along the transition pathway through the transition state. The solvent environment surrounding the ions is encoded through descriptors based on atom-centered symmetry functions (ACSFs), which serve as input variables for the neural network. In addition, an explainable artificial intelligence technique is applied to identify ACSFs that contribute to the reaction coordinate. A comparative analysis of their correlation with CVs representing water bridging structures, such as interionic water density and the number of water molecules coordinating both ions, further provides a molecular-level interpretation of the ion association-dissociation mechanism in water.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.09468v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Chitosan/alginate bionanocomposites adorned with mesoporous silica nanoparticles for bone tissue engineering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22192</link><description>arXiv:2601.22192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The regeneration of oral and craniofacial bone defects ranging from minor periodontal and peri-implant defects to large and critical lesions imposes a substantial global health burden. Conventional therapies are associated with several limitations, highlighting the development of a unique treatment strategy, such as tissue engineering. A well-designed scaffold for bone tissue engineering should possess biocompatibility, biodegradability, mechanical strength, and osteoconductivity. For this purpose, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were synthesized and incorporated at different ratios (10, 20, and 30%) into alginate/chitosan (Alg/Chit)-based porous composite scaffolds fabricated through the freeze-drying method. The MSN incorporation significantly improved the mechanical strength of the scaffolds while showing a negligible decreasing effect on the porosity. All of the samples showed desirable swelling behaviors, which is beneficial for cell attachment and proliferation. The MSN-containing scaffolds indicated a decreased hydrolytic degradation in an MSN percentage-dependent manner. The fabricated scaffolds did not depict cytotoxic characteristics. The Alg/Chit/MSN30 scaffolds not only showed noncytotoxic properties, but also increased the cell viability significantly compared to the control group. The biomineralization properties of the MSN-containing nanocomposite scaffolds were significantly higher than the Alg/Chit composite, suggesting the potential of these nanoparticles for bone tissue engineering applications. Taken together, it is concluded that the Alg/Chit/ MSN30 scaffolds are considerable substances for bone tissue regeneration, and MSN has a great tissue engineering potential in addition to its extensive biomedical applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22192v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Teaching Experiences using the RVfpga Package</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14954</link><description>arXiv:2411.14954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The RVfpga course offers a solid introduction to computer architecture using the RISC-V instruction set and FPGA technology. It focuses on providing hands-on experience with real-world RISC-V cores, the VeeR EH1 and the VeeR EL2, developed by Western Digital a few years ago and currently hosted by ChipsAlliance. This course is particularly aimed at educators and students in computer science, computer engineering, and related fields, enabling them to integrate practical RISC-V knowledge into their curricula. The course materials, which include detailed labs and setup guides, are available for free through the Imagination University Programme website. We have used RVfpga in different teaching activities and we plan to continue using it in the future. Specifically, we have used RVfpga as the main experimental platform in several bachelor/master degree courses; we have completed several final bachelor/master degree projects based on this platform; we will conduct a microcredential about processor design based on RVfpga; we have adapted RVfpga to a MOOC in the edX platform; and we have shared RVfpga worldwide through one-day hands-on workshops and tutorials. This paper begins by discussing how the RVfpga course matches the latest IEEE/ACM/AAAI computing curriculum guidelines. It then details various teaching implementations we have conducted over recent years using these materials. Finally, the paper examines other courses similar to RVfpga, comparing their strengths and weaknesses.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.14954v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Report for NSF Workshop on AI for Electronic Design Automation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14541</link><description>arXiv:2601.14541v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report distills the discussions and recommendations from the NSF Workshop on AI for Electronic Design Automation (EDA), held on December 10, 2024 in Vancouver alongside NeurIPS 2024. Bringing together experts across machine learning and EDA, the workshop examined how AI-spanning large language models (LLMs), graph neural networks (GNNs), reinforcement learning (RL), neurosymbolic methods, etc.-can facilitate EDA and shorten design turnaround. The workshop includes four themes: (1) AI for physical synthesis and design for manufacturing (DFM), discussing challenges in physical manufacturing process and potential AI applications; (2) AI for high-level and logic-level synthesis (HLS/LLS), covering pragma insertion, program transformation, RTL code generation, etc.; (3) AI toolbox for optimization and design, discussing frontier AI developments that could potentially be applied to EDA tasks; and (4) AI for test and verification, including LLM-assisted verification tools, ML-augmented SAT solving, security/reliability challenges, etc. The report recommends NSF to foster AI/EDA collaboration, invest in foundational AI for EDA, develop robust data infrastructures, promote scalable compute infrastructure, and invest in workforce development to democratize hardware design and enable next-generation hardware systems.

Ferroptosis, a form of programmed cell death, is closely associated with thyroid cancer prognosis and represents a potential therapeutic target. This study evaluated the antitumor effects of ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD)-mediated RAS-selective lethal 3 (RSL3) delivery to induce ferroptosis in ATC. Microbubbles (MBs) loaded with ferroptosis inducer RSL3 were synthesized and intravenously administered in a nude mouse ATC model, followed by localized ultrasound irradiation to enable targeted intratumoral drug release.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00368-8?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Functional characterization of BAP1 mutations in genome edited cholangiocarcinoma organoids: role in cell death and drug responses</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00357-3?rss=yes</link><description>Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a genetically heterogeneous malignancy of the bile ducts with limited effective treatments and variable chemotherapeutic responses.

Currently, genetic testing can identify causative mutations in 30% of SRNS cases, highlighting the need for complementary pre-treatment stratification approaches.

The discovery in axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) of a regeneration-associated gene identified as either Kazald1 or Kazald2 led us to investigate its evolution via an extensive cross-species analysis. Molecular phylogeny inference identified the gene as Kazald2, and revealed an undescribed four-member Kazald gene family in jawed vertebrates. Synteny comparisons demonstrated that this family originated in the two-round whole genome duplication event.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00309-3?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Development of immune-derived molecular markers for coronary heart disease via multimachine learning</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00228-2?rss=yes</link><description>Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major cardiovascular disorder primarily caused by coronary atherosclerosis, and early, sensitive diagnosis remains a clinical challenge.

However, electrically tunable NDR commonly trades tunability for circuit complexity, area, and power, constraining practical integration and fast reconfigurability. Here, we demonstrate optical control of negative differential photoresistance (NDPR) in a vertical two-dimensional tunnel junction based on Nb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; tunnel barrier. Under illumination, the photocurrent rises with bias and then falls beyond a threshold, forming a clear NDPR region. The effective negative photoresistance is continuously tuned by light power, and wavelength, spanning ∼−1 to −17 MΩ within our measurement window, while the device, as a photodetector, retains high sensitivity (responsivity up to ∼0.49 AW&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). Wavelength-dependent measurements indicate multiple photocurrent-generation pathways and suggest that the NDPR onset correlates with the Nb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;'s band structure. We further carry out simulations by integrating a lumped NDPR element into an LC oscillator circuit, which yields self-oscillation and effectively enhances the resonator quality factors. These results establish adjustable NDPR in a 2D van der Waals tunneling platform and enable light-programmable impedance for reconfigurable optoelectronics, suggesting promising potential for all-optical communication systems.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/6/063103/3379232/Negative-differential-photoresistance-for</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Gate-dependent modulation of rectification characteristics of organic electrochemical rectifiers</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/6/063304/3379054/Gate-dependent-modulation-of-rectification</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Organic Electrochemical Rectifiers (OECRs), derived from Organic Electrochemical Transistors, are promising components for flexible electronics and bioelectronic circuits due to their tunable rectifying behavior. In this study, we investigate the effect of gate electrode material on the rectification performance of OECRs using platinum (Pt), silver (Ag), and copper (Cu) gates. Our results reveal that the gate electrode potential, established through electric double layer formation at the gate/electrolyte interface, significantly influences channel conductivity and sets the intrinsic potential difference between the OECR terminals. Devices with Pt and Ag gates exhibit clear diode-like rectification, while the Cu-gated device displays non-diode-like behavior. Spectro-electrochemical measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy confirm that negative gate electrode potentials (Ag and Cu) induce hole depletion in the channel. Open-circuit potential measurements further reveal a nonlinear potential profile along the channel in the absence of external bias. These findings demonstrate that the intrinsic gate potential is a critical design parameter that governs electrochemical doping, potential distribution, and the overall rectification characteristics of OECRs.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid

Abstract: In this work we present a cavity-enhanced InAs/$\mathrm{In_{0.53}Al_{0.23}Ga_{0.24}As}$ quantum dot (QD) single-photon source in the telecom C-band with a record-low biexciton emitter decay time of \SI{67.4(2)}{ps} under resonant two-photon excitation (TPE). We observe strong multiphoton suppression associated with $g^{(2)}_\mathrm{X}(0) = 0.006(1)$ and $g^{(2)}_\mathrm{XX}(0) = 0.007(1)$ for the exciton (X) and biexciton (XX) emission, respectively. Due to a asymmetric Purcell enhancement of the XX-X cascade, the two-photon interference (TPI) visibility of XX photons under $\pi$-pulse excitation of $V_{\rm{TPI}} = 90(3)\%$ reaches the theoretical limit and clearly exceeds the $\sim60\%$ expected for standard XX-X cascades without photonic engineering. Furthermore, adding a second timed laser pulse coinciding with XX emission energy, we demonstrate stimulated TPE in the telecom C-Band. The result is an improved TPI visibility of the X photons of $V_{\rm{TPI}}=0.69(3)$ compared to TPE with $V_{\rm{TPI}}=0.61(4)$, with both being reduced compared to the theoretical values due to present dephasing effects. The advances presented in this work hold important promises for the implementation of advanced schemes of quantum communication using deterministic quantum light sources.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06140v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Thermal Einstein-de Haas Effect Induced by Chiral Phonons in Carbon Nanotubes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06392</link><description>arXiv:2602.06392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of chirality on phonon thermal transport in semiconducting chiral single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) using lattice dynamics combined with Boltzmann transport theory. We find that transverse acoustic and optical phonon modes, which are degenerate in nonchiral zigzag and armchair SWCNTs, are split in chiral SWCNTs, giving rise to finite phonon angular momentum associated with circular motion of individual atoms. This angular momentum is most efficiently generated in small-diameter nanotubes with intermediate chiral angles. Consequently, chiral SWCNTs are predicted to undergo thermally induced rigid-body rotation with an experimentally observable angular velocity via the thermal Einstein-de Haas effect.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06392v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spin splitting, Kondo correlation and singlet-doublet quantum phase transition in a superconductor-coupled InSb nanosheet quantum dot</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06573</link><description>arXiv:2602.06573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We realize a superconductor-coupled quantum dot (QD) in an InSb nanosheet, a 2D platform promising for studies of topological superconductivity. The device consists of a superconductor-QD-superconductor junction, where a bottom bilayer gate defines the QD and allows tuning of its coupling to the superconducting leads. The QD exhibits large $g$-factors and strong spin-orbit coupling. Transport measurements reveal Coulomb diamond-shaped differential conductance features with even-odd alternating sizes and pronounced conductance lines associated with the superconducting gap, confirming a few-electron, superconductor-coupled regime. At an odd electron occupation, Kondo signatures emerge, including a zero-bias peak that splits with magnetic field and is logarithmically suppressed at elevated temperatures. We further observe a doublet-singlet quantum phase transition, manifested by a clear change of Andreev bound states from crossing to anticrossing as the coupling strength increases. These results underscore the rich physics of InSb nanosheet QDs and their promise for topological quantum devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06573v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Mean-Field Theory for Heider Balance under Heterogeneous Social Temperatures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06342</link><description>arXiv:2602.06342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heider balance theory provides a fundamental framework for understanding the formation of friendly and hostile relations in social networks. Existing stochastic formulations typically assume a uniform social temperature, implying that all interpersonal relations fluctuate with the same intensity. However, studies show that social interactions are highly heterogeneous, with broad variability in stability, volatility, and susceptibility to change. In this work, we introduce a generalized Heider balance model on a complete graph in which each link is assigned its own social temperature. Within a mean-field formulation, we derive a distribution-dependent self-consistency condition for the collective opinion state and identify the criteria governing the transition between polarized and non-polarized configurations. This framework reveals how the entire distribution of interaction heterogeneity shapes the macroscopic behavior of the system. We show that the functional form of the inverse-temperature distribution, in particular whether it is light-tailed or heavy-tailed, leads to qualitatively distinct phase diagrams. We also establish universal bounds for the critical transition, where the homogeneous-temperature limit provides a universal lower bound for the critical mean of an inverse-temperature distribution governing the transition. Numerical simulations confirm the theoretical predictions and highlight the nontrivial effects introduced by heterogeneity. Our results provide a unified route to understanding structural balance in realistic social systems and lay the groundwork for extensions incorporating fluctuations beyond mean field, external fields, and network topologies beyond the complete graph.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06342v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Field theories and quantum methods for stochastic reaction-diffusion systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13377</link><description>arXiv:2409.13377v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex systems are composed of many particles or agents that move and interact with one another. The underlying mathematical framework to model many of these systems must incorporate the spatial transport of particles and their interactions, as well as changes to their copy numbers, all of which can be formulated in terms of stochastic reaction-diffusion processes. The probabilistic representation of these processes is complex because of combinatorial aspects arising due to nonlinear interactions and varying particle numbers. This review presents the main field theory representations of stochastic reaction-diffusion systems, which handle these issues `under-the-hood'. First, we focus on bringing techniques familiar to theoretical physicists -- such as second quantization, Fock space, and path integrals -- back into the classical domain of reaction-diffusion systems. We demonstrate how various field theory representations can all be unified under a single basis-independent representation. We then extend existing quantum-based methods and notation to work directly on the level of the unifying representation, and we illustrate how they can be used to consistently obtain previous known results, such as numerical discretizations and relations between model parameters at multiple scales. Throughout the work, we contextualize how these representations mirror well-known models of chemical physics depending on their spatial resolution, as well as the corresponding macroscopic limits. The framework presented here may find applications in a diverse set of scientific fields, including physical chemistry, theoretical ecology, epidemiology, game theory and socio-economical models of complex systems. The presentation is done in a self-contained educational and unifying manner such that it can be followed by researchers across several fields.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2409.13377v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Tachyonic and parametric instabilities in an extended bosonic Josephson junction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10543</link><description>arXiv:2410.10543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics and decay of quantum phase coherence for Bose-Einstein condensates in tunnel-coupled quantum wires. The two elongated Bose-Einstein condensates exhibit a wide variety of dynamic phenomena where quantum fluctuations can lead to a rapid loss of phase coherence. We investigate the phenomenon of self-trapping in the relative population imbalance of the two condensates, particularly $\pi$-trapped oscillations that occur when also the relative phase is trapped. Though this state appears stable in mean-field descriptions, the $\pi$-trapped state becomes dynamically unstable due to quantum fluctuations. Nonequilibrium instabilities result in the generation of pairs excited from the condensate to higher momentum modes. We identify tachyonic instabilities, which are associated with imaginary parts of the dispersion relation, and parametric resonance instabilities that are triggered by oscillations of the relative phase and populations. At early times, we compute the instability chart of the characteristic modes through a linearized analysis and identify the underlying physical process. At later times, the primary instabilities trigger secondary instabilities due to the build-up of non-linearities. We perform numerical simulations in the Truncated Wigner approximation in order to observe the dynamics also in this non-linear regime. Furthermore, we discuss realistic parameters for experimental realizations of the $\pi$-trapped state in ultracold atom setups.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.10543v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Structural Chirality and Natural Optical Activity across the $\alpha$-to-$\beta$ Phase Transition in SiO$_2$ and AlPO$_4$ from first-principles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03047</link><description>arXiv:2510.03047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Natural optical activity (NOA), the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light, has traditionally been associated with structural chirality. However, this relationship has often been oversimplified, leading to conceptual misunderstandings, particularly when attempts are made to directly correlate structural handedness with optical rotatory power. In reality, the relationship between chirality and NOA is more nuanced: optical activity can arise in both chiral and achiral crystal structures, and the sign of the rotation cannot necessarily be inferred from the handedness of the space group. % In this work, we conduct a first-principles investigation of natural optical activity in SiO$_2$ and AlPO$_4$ crystals, focusing on their enantiomorphic structural phase transition from high-symmetry hexagonal ($P6_422$ or $P6_222$) to low-symmetry trigonal ($P3_121$ or $P3_221$) space groups. This transition, driven by the condensation of a zone-center $\Gamma_3$ phonon mode, reverses the screw axis type given by the space group symbol while leaving the sign of the optical activity unchanged. By following the evolution of the structure and the optical response along the transition pathway, we clarify the microscopic origin of this behavior. We demonstrate that the sense of optical rotation is determined not by the nominal helicity of the screw axis given in the space group symbol, but by the atomic-scale helicity of the most polarizable atoms of the structure.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.03047v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Renormalization of Interacting Random Graph Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07186</link><description>arXiv:2510.07186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random graphs offer a useful mathematical representation of a variety of real world complex networks. Exponential random graphs, for example, are particularly suited towards generating random graphs constrained to have specified statistical moments. In this investigation, we elaborate on a generalization of the former where link probabilities are conditioned on the appearance of other links, corresponding to the introduction of interactions in an effective generalized statistical mechanical formalism. When restricted to the simplest non-trivial case of pairwise interactions, one can derive a closed form renormalization group transformation for maximum coordination number two on the corresponding line graph. Higher coordination numbers do not admit exact closed form renormalization group transformations, a feature that paraphrases the usual absence of exact transformations in two or more dimensional lattice systems. We introduce disorder and study the induced renormalization group flow on its probability assignments, highlighting its formal equivalence to time reversed anisotropic drift-diffusion on the statistical manifold associated with the effective Hamiltonian. We discuss the implications of our findings, stressing the long wavelength irrelevance of certain classes of pair-wise conditioning on random graphs, and conclude with possible applications. These include modeling the scaling behavior of preferential effects on social networks, opinion dynamics, and reinforcement effects on neural networks, as well as how our findings offer a systematic framework to deal with data limitations in inference and reconstruction problems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.07186v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Compact self-matched gyrators using edge magnetoplasmons</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05439</link><description>arXiv:2602.05439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal microwave components are indispensable in quantum information processing and cryogenic measurement. Conventional implementations, however, are bulky and incompatible with on-chip scalable integration. Recent efforts to develop compact on-chip alternatives often rely on active modulation or complex circuit architectures, which introduce additional losses and degrade performance. We demonstrate the realization of compact, self-impedance-matched gyrators based on edge magnetoplasmons in a two-dimensional electron gas. Gyrators can be used as building blocks for other non-reciprocal elements such as isolators and circulators. Our devices achieve gyration from 0.2 to 2 GHz, tunable by moderate out-of plane magnetic fields below 400 mT, and sub-mm footprint, two orders of magnitude smaller than conventional ferrite-based components. Using an electrode geometry predicted to minimize reflections, we achieve insertion losses as low as 2 to 4 dB. The self-matched design framework we utilize is broadly applicable, and can be implemented in a wide variety of non-reciprocal device architectures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05439v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Hyperfine-resolved optical spectroscopy of ultracold $^{87}$Rb$^{133}$Cs molecules: the $\mathrm{b}\,^3\Pi_0$ metastable state</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24660</link><description>arXiv:2510.24660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using an ultracold gas of $^{87}$Rb$^{133}$Cs molecules, we perform hyperfine-resolved spectroscopy of transitions from the vibronic ground state to the lowest rovibrational states of the electronic state $\mathrm{b}\,^3\Pi_0$, as a function of magnetic field. These transitions are spin forbidden, resulting in narrow linewidths, and feature near-diagonal Franck-Condon factors. We develop a model of the hyperfine and Zeeman structure that includes coupling between the $0^+$ and $0^-$ components of $\mathrm{b}\,^3\Pi_0$. We fit the spectra to obtain rotational and hyperfine coupling constants. We measure transition dipole moments associated with specific transitions by directly observing Rabi oscillations as a function of a resonant laser pulse duration. Using resonant $\pi$ pulses, we prepare molecules in the electronically excited state and directly measure the spontaneous emission rate.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.24660v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] The Avatar Cache: Enabling On-Demand Security with Morphable Cache Architecture</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06433</link><description>arXiv:2602.06433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sharing of the last-level cache (LLC) among multiple cores makes it vulnerable to cross-core conflict- and occupancy-based attacks. Despite extensive prior work, modern processors still employ non-secure set-associative LLCs. Existing secure LLC designs broadly fall into two categories: (i) randomized and (ii) partitioned. The state-of-the-art randomized design, Mirage, mitigates conflict-based attacks but incurs significant area overhead (20% additional storage) and design complexity. Partitioned LLCs mitigate both conflict- and occupancy-based attacks, but often suffer from large performance overheads (on average over 5% and up to 49%), require OS support in set-based schemes, or face scalability issues in way-based schemes. These factors pose major obstacles to the industrial adoption of secure LLCs. This paper asks whether strong LLC security can be achieved with minimal changes to a conventional set-associative LLC, enabling security only when needed while preserving low performance, power, and area overheads. We propose Avatar, a secure and morphable LLC that supports three modes: non-secure (Avatar-N), randomized secure (Avatar-R), and partitioned secure (Avatar-P), and can switch dynamically between them. Avatar closely resembles a conventional set-associative LLC, facilitating industrial adoption. Avatar-R introduces extra invalid entries and leverages high associativity to provide a strong security guarantee with little capacity loss, achieving only one set-associative eviction per $10^{30}$ years, while incurring 1.5% storage overhead, a 2.7% increase in static power, and a 0.2% slowdown over a 16~MB baseline. Avatar-P mitigates both conflict- and occupancy-based attacks with only a 3% performance overhead, substantially outperforming prior way-based partitioned LLCs. When security is unnecessary, Avatar switches to Avatar-N to maximize performance and energy efficiency.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06433v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] FeNN-DMA: A RISC-V SoC for SNN acceleration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00732</link><description>arXiv:2511.00732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a promising, energy-efficient alternative to standard Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and are particularly well-suited to spatio-temporal tasks such as keyword spotting and video classification. However, SNNs have a much lower arithmetic intensity than ANNs and are therefore not well-matched to standard accelerators like GPUs and TPUs. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are designed for such memory-bound workloads, and here we present a novel, fully-programmable RISC-V-based system-on-chip (FeNN-DMA), tailored to simulating SNNs on modern UltraScale+ FPGAs. We show that FeNN-DMA has comparable resource usage and energy requirements to state-of-the-art fixed-function SNN accelerators, yet it supports more complex neuron models and network topologies, and can simulate up to 16 thousand neurons and 256 million synapses per core. Using this functionality, we demonstrate state-of-the-art classification accuracy on the Spiking Heidelberg Digits, Neuromorphic MNIST and Braille tactile classification tasks.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.00732v2</guid></item><item><title>[Nature] How to stop the survey-taking AI chatbots that threaten to upend social science</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00386-2</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature, Published online: 09 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00386-2"&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-026-00386-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Researchers need new bot-detection strategies that exploit the limits of human reasoning rather than AI weaknesses.</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00386-2</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] When machine learning models learn chemistry II: applying WISP to real-world examples</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2026/DD/D5DD00399G</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/image/GA?id=D5DD00399G" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2026, Advance Article&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00399G, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Kerrin Janssen, Jan M.

This article introduces a mathematical model that captures these oscillations. It describes the formation and dissolution of an oxide layer, determining the oxide composition and the electrostatic potential perpendicular to the electrode. Oscillationsoccur if the following three conditions are met: the etching speed increases with defects in the oxide layer, the defect density decreases with increasing electric field at the Si-oxide interface,and a sufficient time delay exists between production and etching of the oxide.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00334-2?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Spin–orbit coupling signatures in polycrystalline bismuth thin films</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/6/063102/3378915/Spin-orbit-coupling-signatures-in-polycrystalline</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Bismuth is recognized as one of the elemental solids with the strongest intrinsic spin–orbit coupling (SOC) and is widely used to induce topological characteristics in hetero-structures, particularly in chalcogenide-based material systems. Precise control over the crystalline quality and phase purity of bismuth is crucial for its characteristic topological features which can be achieved via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). In this work, we investigate the electronic transport properties of MBE-grown Bi thin films deposited on Si(111) substrates. Robust spin–orbit coupling is manifested through pronounced weak anti-localization features observed under both out-of-plane and in-plane magnetic fields. In addition, a planar Hall response consistent with Rashba-type SOC emerges at room temperature, underscoring the strong interfacial and structural asymmetry in these MBE-grown Bi films. These films display a temperature-driven sign reversal in the Hall carrier concentration, indicating a transition in the dominant carrier type. Collectively, these observations advance the fundamental understanding of SOC-mediated transport in low-dimensional Bi and open avenues for engineering Rashba-dominated states in functional hetero-structures.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/6/063102/3378915/Spin-orbit-coupling-signatures-in-polycrystalline</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] High-order harmonics generation in MoS 2  nanosheets in the presence of CdSe and CdSe/V 2 O 5  quantum dots</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/6/061101/3378914/High-order-harmonics-generation-in-MoS2-nanosheets</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Engineering nonlinear optical responses in two-dimensional materials via heterostructure design is emerging as a powerful approach for next-generation photonic devices. Although perturbative nonlinear effects in these systems are well studied, their connection to nonperturbative processes such as high-harmonic generation (HHG) remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the HHG from few-layer MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets integrated with CdSe and passivated CdSe/V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; quantum dots (QDs). The hybrid structures exhibit pronounced enhancement in harmonic intensity and a clear extension of the harmonic cutoff relative to pristine MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. We demonstrate that interfacial charge-transfer dynamics—previously associated with the dominant contribution to the third-order susceptibility χ&lt;sup&gt;(3)&lt;/sup&gt;—also govern the efficiency of HHG, thereby establishing a direct link between perturbative and nonperturbative regimes in these 0D–2D hybrids. The carrier injection from the QDs increases the electron–hole population participating in HHG, while the moderated response in passivated QD systems highlights the role of interfacial potential barriers. These results provide a unified physical picture of nonlinear optical processes in hybrid nanostructures and offer design principles for enhancing coherent light generation.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/6/061101/3378914/High-order-harmonics-generation-in-MoS2-nanosheets</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Conductivity decay in freshly fabricated TFB films</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/6/061901/3378907/Conductivity-decay-in-freshly-fabricated-TFB-films</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Understanding the hole transport layers is fundamental to improve the stability of quantum-dot light-emitting diodes. This study investigates the short-term conductivity decay of freshly fabricated poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-co-N-(4-(3-methylpropyl))diphenylamine) (TFB) films under applied voltage. In addition, the conductivity decay of freshly prepared TFB films can be partially recovered after short-term storage. The phenomenon is also observed in other hole transporting materials, such as PVK and PF8Cz. The decay dynamics can be described using the Kohlrausch–Williams–Watts stretched-exponential function. The temperature-dependent relaxation time extracted from the decay curves obeys an Arrhenius law, yielding an activation energy of  0.18  ±  0.03 eV. This value is in good agreement with the calculated reorganization energy associated with the hopping transport of charge carriers. Based on the results, conductivity decay of freshly fabricated TFB films during the initial short-term period can be explained by the coupling between electric field-induced polarization and carrier transport (denoted as polarization–conduction coupling).&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/6/061901/3378907/Conductivity-decay-in-freshly-fabricated-TFB-films</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] In situ  analysis of SiO 2  films etched under cryogenic conditions using H 2 /F 2 /Ar gas mixture plasma</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/6/061602/3378902/In-situ-analysis-of-SiO2-films-etched-under</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;High aspect ratio hole etching processes require high-speed etching of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; films. Cryogenic etching significantly increases the etch rates of these two films by lowering the substrate temperature. However, the etching behavior and mechanisms in the temperature range below −70 °C remain unclear. In this work, we investigate the etching behavior of blanket SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; films, from 25 to −200 °C, and examine the mechanisms through &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;in situ&lt;/span&gt; analyses. Our results show that the etch rate at −100 °C is approximately 3.2 times higher than that at 25 °C, and is associated with the highest etching efficiency in our experiments. This enhancement in the etch rate is attributed to the co-adsorption of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and HF, which increases the number of etchants on the SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; surface. At temperatures lower than −100 °C, the solidification of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O reduces the co-adsorption of HF, decreasing the etch rate. At temperatures below −150 °C, the etch rate declines further, owing to the reduced volatility of the reaction product SiF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. These findings provide valuable insights for optimizing etching processes under cryogenic conditions.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/6/061602/3378902/In-situ-analysis-of-SiO2-films-etched-under</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Auxiliary Linker-Enabled Local Protonation Boosts the Ammonia Electrosynthesis in Heterometallic Metal–Organic Frameworks</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c20755</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c20755/asset/images/medium/ja5c20755_0005.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c20755&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 19:48:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c20755</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] High-Energy Hybridized States Enable Long-Lived Hot Electrons in Cobaloxime-Silicon Nanocrystal System</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c19326</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c19326/asset/images/medium/ja5c19326_0006.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c19326&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 19:19:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c19326</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Fused Rubrene Derivatives with Embedded Seven-Membered Rings: Curvature-Dependent Photophysical and Semiconductor Properties</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c22771</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c22771/asset/images/medium/ja5c22771_0010.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c22771&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 18:40:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c22771</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Unraveling the Mechanism of a Co(−I)–Ga Photoreductant in the Catalytic Hydrodefluorination of Electron-Rich Fluoroarenes</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c16672</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c16672/asset/images/medium/ja5c16672_0012.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c16672&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 18:22:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c16672</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Science: Table of Contents] H2S‐Releasing Aspirin Nanoparticles Alleviate Endometriosis and Associated Anxiety</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202520787?af=R</link><description>Advanced Science, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Science: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 18:11:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/advs.202520787</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] ZBED6–IGF2–PIK3C3 Autophagy Axis Drives ccRCC Progression: a Multi-Omics Integration Study</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00327-5?rss=yes</link><description>Autophagy supports clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) progression, yet its upstream regulatory mechanisms remain to be fully defined. Integrating bulk, single-cell, and spatial transcriptomics, we identify a regulatory axis wherein the transcription factor ZBED6 activates expression of the autophagy-initiating kinase PIK3C3 via repression of IGF2, thereby driving pro-tumorigenic autophagy. Spatial analysis confirms co-localization of ZBED6 and PIK3C3 in tumor tissues. Using genes associated with this axis, we develop a six-gene prognostic signature that stratifies patients with distinct survival outcomes and differential responses to immunotherapy and targeted therapy.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00327-5?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Photoredox Unmasking of Aromatic C–H Bonds in Living Environments Enabled by Thianthrenium Salts</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.6c00530</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.6c00530/asset/images/medium/ja6c00530_0007.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.6c00530&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 15:30:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.6c00530</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Single-Channel Saturation at the Quantum Conductance Limit in Single-Molecule Junctions</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c18067</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c18067/asset/images/medium/ja5c18067_0006.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c18067&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 15:29:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c18067</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Development of Substrate-Directed Activity-Based Probes via Disulfide-Trapping for Site-Specific Interrogation of Nucleosomal Deubiquitination</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c20156</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c20156/asset/images/medium/ja5c20156_0008.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c20156&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 14:33:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c20156</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Managing Active Hydrogen Species on Ternary Copper-Based Catalyst for Efficient Electrochemical Ammonia Synthesis from Nitrate</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c21149</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c21149/asset/images/medium/ja5c21149_0006.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c21149&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 14:32:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c21149</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Spin-Conserved Hot Charge Transfer Exciton Formation and Cooling at the Two-Dimensional Semiconductor Interface</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c20527</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c20527/asset/images/medium/ja5c20527_0006.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c20527&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 14:31:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c20527</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Hepatocytes functionally reprogrammed by KIAA1199-high colorectal cancer cells favour the accumulation of pro-metastatic Egr1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neutrophils</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69250-1</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 07 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69250-1"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-69250-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;KIAA1199 is upregulated in colorectal cancer (CRC), associated with metastasis and poor clinical outcomes.

To better understand APOL1-related pathologies, we examined genetic drivers of circulating APOL1 in individuals of African and European ancestry across multiple cohorts using three proteomic technologies (Olink, SomaLogic, mass spectrometry). Disease-associated APOL1 G1 and G2 variants were strong cis-pQTLs for plasma APOL1 measured by Olink and SomaLogic, but not mass spectrometry.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Sat, 07

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been considered as a next-generation disruptive photovoltaic technology, yet their advancement is constrained by the complexity of perovskite recipe with high-dimensional material and process design space. Despite the impressive general reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs), they struggle with two limitations for application in PSCs: an inability to align general semantics with the perovskite domain knowledge, and an inefficiency in navigating high-dimensional perovskite material and recipe design spaces. To address these limitations, we introduce a domain-knowledge-guided framework PVK-LLM, a specialized model to serve as an expert to bridge general semantics with perovskite domain knowledge. By integrating this domain knowledge into a hierarchical Bayesian Optimization workflow, our approach efficiently navigates the high-dimension design space on a solar cell simulator platform. The domain knowledge resolves cold-start problems while dynamically adapting to simulator feedback. Moreover, in an individual wet-lab experiment aimed at maximizing power conversion efficiency (PCE), our framework autonomously proposes a novel synergistic four-component recipe comprising specialized organic passivation recipe (3MTPAI, PDAI2, EDAI2, and PipDI) which has not been reported in existing literature. This AI-designed recipe effectively achieves a champion PCE value of over 26.0 %, approaching world records achieved through extensive expert trial-and-error. Our approach can effectively enable LLM comprehend the domain knowledge, which can efficiently navigate in a high-dimensional, capable to accelerate the advancement in real-world perovskite as well as other material science development.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04914v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Constraints on stability and renormalization group flows in nonequilibrium matter</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04961</link><description>arXiv:2602.04961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive constraints on renormalization group (RG) flows and stability of phases in nonequilibrium systems using quantum information inequalities. These constraints involve conditional mutual information (CMI), which quantifies correlations between spatially separated regions not mediated by their surroundings. First, assuming CMI is UV finite, we show that the scaling function associated with CMI is monotonic along the RG flow. This implies a non-perturbative stability criterion: a fixed point with smaller CMI cannot be destabilized toward one with larger CMI. Second, we bound the CMI of a convex mixture of states in terms of the CMI of individual components. We use this inequality to infer perturbative stability of spontaneous symmetry breaking states against quantum channels that explicitly break symmetry. We illustrate these constraints through several examples, including decoherence-driven transitions in classical symmetry-broken states, strong-to-weak symmetry breaking criticality in two dimensions, and even transitions in pure quantum states. We also discuss implications for classical nonequilibrium steady states.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04961v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Josephson Dynamics of 2D Bose-Einstein Condensates in Dual-Core Trap: Homogeneous, Droplet-Droplet, and Vortex-Vortex Regimes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05001</link><description>arXiv:2602.05001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of a two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate mixture, loaded into a dual-core trap, when beyond-mean-field effects are taken into account, are considered. The effects of quantum fluctuations are described by the Lee-Huang-Yang correction terms in the extended coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations. The spatially uniform and inhomogeneous BEC cases are studied. In the first case, the parameter regimes associated with macroscopic quantum tunnelling, self-trapping, and revival-like localisation dynamics are found. The Josephson oscillation frequencies for both the zero-phase and the $\pi$-phase modes are derived. As the total atom number varies, the dynamics exhibit a nontrivial bifurcation structure: along the zero-phase branch, two pitchfork bifurcations generate bistability and hysteresis, while the $\pi$-phase branch shows a single pitchfork bifurcation. In the second case, the Josephson dynamics for quantum droplets and vortices are investigated. Predictions for the oscillation frequencies of the atomic population between quantum droplets are obtained and fully validated by direct numerical simulations of coupled extended GP equations. The existence of the Andreev-Bashkin nondissipative drag through simulations of droplet-droplet interactions is shown. The Josephson dynamics of vortex states are studied. Vortices with topological charge $S$ and sufficiently small particle number are typically unstable, breaking up into $S+1$ (occasionally $S+2$) fundamental fragments, with the breakup time increasing as the particle number grows. Unstable asymmetric vortices show splitting and/or crescent-like instability. For vortices with sufficiently large norms, long-time simulations confirm robust stability against small perturbations; in this regime, Josephson oscillations and Andreev-Bashkin-type entrainment for vortex states with charges $S=1, 2$, and $3$ are investigated.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05001v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Strong radial electric field scaling near nanoscale conductive filaments and the ReRAM resistive switching mechanism</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05067</link><description>arXiv:2602.05067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics underlying reset in bipolar resistive memory has been the subject of decades of controversy and has been identified as the primary barrier to resistive memory technology development. This manuscript introduces a nanoscale effect in current carrying conductors, whereby surface charge induced radial electric fields are found to be inversely proportional to the radius of the conductive path. This nanoscale effect is then applied to explain the negative resistance switching (reset) mechanism in filamentary metal oxide resistive switching memory devices (memristors). Previous explanations for the negative resistive switching mechanism state that diffusion constitutes the radial driving mechanism for oxygen ions, and drift under electric fields is restricted to the direction parallel to current flow. This explanation conflicts with retention and microscopy data collected in a subset of devices presented in literature. We demonstrate that the electric field's dependency on the on the radius of a nanoscale conductive path can result in radial fields on the order of 10^5 to 10^6 V/cm at only -1 V bias, sufficient to govern the negative resistance switching mechanism in filamentary metal oxides. By accounting for this nanoscale size effect, long standing anomalous experimental data about the negative (reset) resistance switching mechanism in bipolar filamentary resistive memory devices is finally reconciled. Wide understanding of surface charges and associated electric fields in nanoscale conductive paths could prove important for further scaling of integrated circuits and aid in elucidating many nanoscale phenomena.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05067v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spin current generation via magnetic skyrmion, bimeron, and meron crystals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05332</link><description>arXiv:2602.05332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin current offers a promising route toward energy-efficient and high-speed information processing. Developing efficient methods for their generation remains a central challenge in spintronics. Here, we investigate spin current generation via two-dimensional topological spin textures: a skyrmion crystal (SkX) with out-of-plane magnetization, a bimeron crystal (BmX) with in-plane magnetization, and a meron crystal (MX) with zero net magnetization. We show that these distinct spin textures generate spin currents with characteristic spin polarization directions. In the absence of spin--orbit coupling, the SkX and BmX generate spin currents polarized along their magnetization directions, whereas the MX yields no spin current. Upon introducing spin--orbit coupling, while the behavior of the SkX does not qualitatively change, the BmX generates nonzero spin currents in multiple polarization directions. Notably, the MX, despite its zero net magnetization, exhibits a pronounced spin current with out-of-plane spin polarization, driven by an enhanced spin Berry curvature associated with characteristic band degeneracy. We further demonstrate that the electronic and spin transport properties of each texture are governed by their magnetic symmetries. Our results highlight the topological spin textures as efficient sources of spin current even without net magnetization, expanding the design for spintronics devices based on topological magnetic metals.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05332v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] First-principles study of photovoltaic and thermoelectric properties of AgBiSCl2</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05355</link><description>arXiv:2602.05355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work systematically investigates the potential of the hybrid anion semiconductor AgBiSCl2 for photovoltaic and thermoelectric applications, aiming to provide theoretical guidance for high-performance energy conversion devices. Structural analysis reveals favorable ductility and a relatively low Debye temperature. Analysis of interatomic interactions indicates that Ag-S and Ag-Cl bonds are relatively weak, resulting in local structural softness and enhanced lattice anharmonicity. These weak bonds facilitate phonon scattering and give rise to low-frequency localized rattling vibrations primarily associated with Ag atoms, contributing to reduced lattice thermal conductivity. In contrast, Bi-S bonds exhibit stronger, directional interactions, which help stabilize the overall structure. The coexistence of weak bonding and strong lattice coupling enables favorable modulation of thermal transport properties.Optically, AgBiSCl2 possesses a high static dielectric constant and exhibits strong absorption in the ultraviolet region. In terms of thermal transport, phonon spectrum exhibit mode hardening with temperature increasing. The localized Ag vibrations intensify the anharmonicity, reducing phonon lifetimes and group velocities.For electronic transport, the p-type material maintains a higher Seebeck coefficient than the n-type, while the latter shows greater electrical conductivity. At 700 K, the figure of merit reaches 0.77 for p-type and 0.69 for n-type AgBiSCl2, indicating promising high-temperature thermoelectric performance.In summary, AgBiSCl2 exhibits excellent potential for dual photovoltaic and thermoelectric applications. Its unique bonding features and lattice response mechanisms offer valuable insights into designing multifunctional energy conversion materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05355v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Compact self-matched gyrators using edge magnetoplasmons</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05439</link><description>arXiv:2602.05439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal microwave components are indispensable in quantum information processing and cryogenic measurement. Conventional implementations, however, are bulky and incompatible with on-chip scalable integration. Recent efforts to develop compact on-chip alternatives often rely on active modulation or complex circuit architectures, which introduce additional losses and degrade performance. We demonstrate the realization of compact, self-impedance-matched gyrators based on edge magnetoplasmons in a two-dimensional electron gas. Gyrators can be used as building blocks for other non-reciprocal elements such as isolators and circulators. Our devices achieve gyration from 0.2 to 2 GHz, tunable by moderate out-of plane magnetic fields below 400 mT, and sub-mm footprint, two orders of magnitude smaller than conventional ferrite-based components. Using an electrode geometry predicted to minimize reflections, we achieve insertion losses as low as 2 to 4 dB. The self-matched design framework we utilize is broadly applicable, and can be implemented in a wide variety of non-reciprocal device architectures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05439v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Reducing the Computational Cost Scaling of Tensor Network Algorithms via Field-Programmable Gate Array Parallelism</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05900</link><description>arXiv:2602.05900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving the computational efficiency of quantum many-body calculations from a hardware perspective remains a critical challenge. Although field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have recently been exploited to improve the computational scaling of algorithms such as Monte Carlo methods, their application to tensor network algorithms is still at an early stage. In this work, we propose a fine-grained parallel tensor network design based on FPGAs to substantially enhance the computational efficiency of two representative tensor network algorithms: the infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD) and the higher-order tensor renormalization group (HOTRG). By employing a quad-tile partitioning strategy to decompose tensor elements and map them onto hardware circuits, our approach effectively translates algorithmic computational complexity into scalable hardware resource utilization, enabling an extremely high degree of parallelism on FPGAs. Compared with conventional CPU-based implementations, our scheme exhibits superior scalability in computation time, reducing the bond-dimension scaling of the computational cost from $O(D_b^3)$ to $O(D_b)$ for iTEBD and from $O(D_b^6)$ to $O(D_b^2)$ for HOTRG. This work provides a theoretical foundation for future hardware implementations of large-scale tensor network computations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05900v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spontaneous Parity Breaking in Quantum Antiferromagnets on the Triangular Lattice</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05901</link><description>arXiv:2602.05901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frustration on the triangular lattice has long been a source of intriguing and often debated phases in many-body systems. Although symmetry analysis has been employed, the role of the seemingly trivial parity symmetry has received little attention. In this work, we show that phases induced by frustration are systematically shaped by an implicit rule of thumb associated with spontaneous parity breaking. This principle enables us to anticipate and rationalize the regimes and conditions under which nontrivial phases emerge. For the spin-$S$ antiferromagnetic XXZ model, we demonstrate that a controversial parity-broken phase appears only at intermediate values of $S$. In bilayer systems, enhanced frustration leads to additional phases, such as supersolids, whose properties can be classified by their characteristic parity features. Benefiting from our improved tensor network contraction techniques, we confirm these results through large-scale tensor-network calculations. This study offers an alternative viewpoint and a systematic approach for examining the interplay between spin, symmetry, and frustration in many-body systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05901v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Tunable multi-magnon Floquet topological edge states</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20049</link><description>arXiv:2508.20049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that periodically time-modulating the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in a two-dimensional magnon insulator may induce a topological phase transition that results in the presence of robust edge modes. To this end, we study a square lattice of spins interacting via an XXZ Heisenberg model with a ferromagnetic longitudinal coupling and antiferromagnetic transverse coupling, as well as the aforementioned time-modulated DMI. The topologically protected edge states of this system are composed of coherent superpositions of single-magnon excitations and two magnon bound states. Furthermore, we show that the chirality of the edge states can be controlled by adjusting the relative phase for the drive on the DMI associated with nearest neighbors in the x and y directions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.20049v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Shape-specific fluctuations of an active colloidal interface</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08567</link><description>arXiv:2509.08567v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by a recently synthesizable class of active interfaces formed by linked self--propelled colloids, we investigate the dynamics and fluctuations of a phoretically (chemically) interacting active interface with roto--translational coupling. We enumerate all steady--state shapes of the interface across parameter space and identify a regime where the interface acquires a finite curvature, leading to a characteristic ''C--shaped'' topology, along with persistent self--propulsion. In this phase, the interface height fluctuations obey Family--Vicsek scaling but with novel exponents: a dynamic exponent $z_h \approx 0.5$, a roughness exponent $\alpha_h \approx 0.9$ and a super--ballistic growth exponent $\beta_h \approx 1.7$. In contrast, the orientational fluctuations of the colloidal monomers exhibit a negative roughness exponent, reflecting a surprising smoothness law, where steady--state fluctuations diminish with increasing system size. Together, these findings point towards a unique non--equilibrium universality class associated with self--propelled interfaces of non--standard shape.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.08567v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Average density of Bloch electrons in a homogeneous magnetic field: A second-order response</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08761</link><description>arXiv:2511.08761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the average density of a three-dimensional multiband crystal of arbitrary symmetry, metal or insulator, to first and second order in a weak homogeneous magnetic field. To linear order and for insulators, the density follows the well-known Streda formula, but for metals there is an extra contribution from the orbital magnetic moments at the Fermi surface. To second order the average density depends on several microscopic processes. Among these, the quantum metric tensor plays an important role by generating a pseudo-magnetic moment resulting from the rotation of the Bloch wave functions in the complex projective plane. We also discuss the implications of our results for the volume and pressure. The method we develop is explicitly gauge invariant, considers intraband and interband processes on equal footing, accommodates relaxation processes, and can be readily extended to other observables.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.08761v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Ion Jump Motion as the Background for Muon Diffusion in Battery Materials Research Using $\mu$SR</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21013</link><description>arXiv:2511.21013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) in ion diffusion were performed using the {\sl extended} Kubo-Toyabe (KT) relaxation function $G_z^{\rm EA}(t)$ that incorporates an Edwards-Anderson type autocorrelation function for the jump motion of ions. The analysis of the generated $\mu$SR spectra using the conventional KT function $G_z^{\rm KT}(t;\Delta_{\rm KT},\nu_{\rm KT})$ (mimicking the previous analysis procedure) suggest that the anomalous peak in the fluctuation rate $\nu_{\rm KT}$ around a specific temperature $T^*$ and associated decrease of the linewidth $\Delta_{\rm KT}$ above $T^*$, often observed in the previous $\mu$SR studies on ion diffusion, originate from the sharp increase in the ion jump rate $\nu_{\rm i}$ against that of the muon $\nu_\mu$ with increasing temperature. This indicates that a more detailed reanalysis of the vintage data using $G_z^{\rm EA}(t)$ is useful for the proper evaluation of $\nu_{\rm i}$ and $\nu_\mu$. Meanwhile, it also suggests that the $\mu$SR results showing no such anomaly convey little information on ion diffusion.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.21013v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Topological hybridisation of plasmons with ferrimagnetic magnons</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18995</link><description>arXiv:2601.18995v3 Announce Type: replace

Using a combined microscopic-macroscopic framework for plasmon-magnon coupling, we show that plasmons and magnons strongly hybridize over both GHz and THz frequency ranges, enabling experimental access well above cryogenic temperatures. Moreover, the developed approach provides an efficient and natural classification of the topology of the hybrid modes, rooted in the phase winding of the plasmon-magnon coupling induced by spin-momentum locking and the associated chiral winding of the electronic spin along the Fermi contours. Finally, we identify experimentally accessible manifestations of the hybridization, such as topological interface modes and an anomalous thermal Hall response.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18995v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dynamics of string breaking and revival in a Rydberg atomic chain</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04141</link><description>arXiv:2602.04141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: String breaking is one of the most representative non-perturbative dynamics processes in confinement theory, typically associated with the creation of particle-antiparticle pairs. In this paper, we take a one-dimensional Rydberg atomic chain to theoretically study the dynamical of finite-length string state. Under different string tension conditions, we find that the string dynamics exhibits two clearly distinguishable evolution characteristics: one is that the string breaks and the system enters a superposition state space containing multiple meson state configurations; the other is localized string dynamics, in which the string undergoes local breaking but can then recombine and return to a state close to the initial structure, with the breaking and recombination processes recurring over a long time scale. Through the analysis of the evolution of different meson state configurations, we visually depict the redistribution of configuration weights during the string breaking process, and reveal the observable recovery characteristics of the string after breaking. Further analysis shows that the enhancement of quantum fluctuations can increase the weight of the double-meson state configurations in the system wave function without changing the dominant dynamical behavior. The above results present a rich picture of string breaking dynamics in a one-dimensional Rydberg atomic chain and provide insights for studying confinement physics and related gauge field theory phenomena on quantum simulation platforms.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04141v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Recovery dynamics of a gap-engineered transmon after a quasiparticle burst</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08104</link><description>arXiv:2505.08104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ionizing radiation impacts create bursts of quasiparticle density in superconducting qubits. These bursts temporarily degrade qubit coherence which can be detrimental for quantum error correction. Here, we experimentally resolve quasiparticle bursts in 3D gap-engineered transmon qubits by continuously monitoring qubit transitions. Gap engineering allows us to reduce the burst detection rate by a factor of five. This reduction falls four orders of magnitude short of that expected if the quasiparticles were to quickly thermalize to the cryostat temperature. We associate the limited effect of gap engineering with the slow thermalization of the phonons in our chips after the burst.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.08104v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] System-Level Isolation for Mixed-Criticality RISC-V SoCs: A "World" Reality Check</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05002</link><description>arXiv:2602.05002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As RISC-V adoption accelerates, domains such as automotive, the Internet of Things (IoT), and industrial control are attracting growing attention. These domains are subject to stringent Size, Weight, Power, and Cost (SWaP-C) constraints, which have driven a shift toward heterogeneous Systems-on-Chip (SoCs) integrating general-purpose CPUs, tightly coupled accelerators, and diverse I/O devices with different integrity levels. While such integration improves cost efficiency and performance, it introduces a fundamental safety and security challenge: enforcing system-level isolation in mixed-criticality environments. Although RISC-V International has proposed several hardware isolation primitives, including RISC-V Worlds, IOPMP, and SmMTT, their interoperability, scalability, and suitability for real-time systems remain insufficiently understood. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of these primitives from the perspective of practical heterogeneous SoC designs. We implement an IOPMP, a World-based checker, and a modified RISC-V World checker that addresses key limitations of the baseline specification, and evaluate their trade-offs in terms of security guarantees and power-performance-area (PPA). Our results show that the World-based checker introduces a fixed, configuration-independent access latency, achieving lower worst-case delay than the evaluated alternatives while scaling predictably with system size. At the macro level, we estimate that the proposed modifications reduce SoC area by up to approximately 5% compared to a baseline design. All artifacts will be released as open source, and we expect these findings to directly contribute to the evolution and ratification of RISC-V specifications, as well as to the design of future RISC-V SoCs.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05002v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] CGRA4ML: A Hardware/Software Framework to Implement Neural Networks for Scientific Edge Computing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15561</link><description>arXiv:2408.15561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scientific community increasingly relies on machine learning (ML) for near-sensor processing, leveraging its strengths in tasks such as pattern recognition, anomaly detection, and real-time decision-making. These deployments demand accelerators that combine extremely high performance with programmability, ease of integration, and straightforward verification. We present cgra4ml, an open-source, modular framework that generates parameterizable CGRA accelerators in synthesizable SystemVerilog RTL, tailored to common ML compute patterns found in scientific applications. The framework supports seamless system integration through AXI-compliant interfaces and open-source DMA components, and it includes automatic firmware generation for programming the accelerator. A comprehensive verification suite and a runtime firmware stack further support deployment across diverse SoC platforms. cgra4ml provides a modular, full-stack infrastructure, including a Python API, SystemVerilog hardware, TCL toolflows, and a C runtime, which facilitates easy integration and experimentation, allowing scientists to focus on innovation rather than dealing with the intricacies of hardware design and optimization.

As multigene models outperform single-gene markers, they are crucial for advancing clinical decision-making. From 4 microarray datasets (n=859) and a large OC cohort (n=1793), we identified 87 overall survival (OS) and/or progression-free survival (PFS)-associated genes. Multigene models revealed that 25 combinations and 5 combinations were predicted at least 5-year OS and 5-year PFS, respectively. Notably, compared with all combinations of 4 randomly selected genes, combinations involving ALDH1A2, DCN, GATA6, and PDGFRA were frequent among the top 20 OS models; 6 combinations predicted at least 50-month OS, and tissue microarray (155 OC samples) analyses confirmed this.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00307-X?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Interferon Signaling Gene Expression and DNA Methylation Interactions in Sjögren's Disease via Mendelian Randomization</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00325-1?rss=yes</link><description>Sjögren's disease (SD) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by dysregulated interferon (IFN) signaling, but the causal genes and regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. We integrated transcriptomic, epigenomic, and genetic data using summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) and colocalization analyses. Meta-analysis of three datasets (N=124) identified 331 differentially expressed IFN-associated genes enriched in immune cells. SMR analysis of blood and MSG eQTL/mQTL with SD GWAS identified five causal genes: SH2B3, LGALS9, CD40, GRB2, and DTX3L.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 00:00:00

Abstract: Understanding defects in atomically thin van der Waals (vdW) semiconductors is essential for advancing their use in next-generation optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices. Here, we apply a combination of various impedance spectroscopy techniques to two-dimensional (2D) vdW GaSe doped with silicon (Si) to reconstruct deep trap states across the full bandgap. Deep-level transient spectroscopy reveals three distinct deep states 0.31, 0.88, and 1.40 eV below the conduction band edge. Complementary deep-level optical spectroscopy and photocapacitance measurements identify three deep states at 1.4 and 1.8 eV below the conduction band edge, and 2.0 eV above the valence band edge, with thermal admittance spectroscopy providing additional verification and further resolving two trap states, at 0.16 eV above the valence band edge and at 0.26 eV below the conduction band edge. By comparing the experimentally extracted ionization energies with the predictions of density functional theory, our results attribute these trap states primarily to Si-related defects and metal vacancies. This work presents a comprehensive defect map of Si-doped GaSe, providing critical insights into carrier trapping mechanisms that are essential for optimizing the design of 2D material-based devices for industrial applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03964v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dynamics of string breaking and revival in a Rydberg atomic chain</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04141</link><description>arXiv:2602.04141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: String breaking is one of the most representative nonperturbative dynamics processes in confinement theory, typically associated with the creation of particle-antiparticle pairs. In this paper, we take a one-dimensional Rydberg atomic chain to theoretically study the dynamical of finite-length string state. Under different string tension conditions, we find that the string dynamics exhibits two clearly distinguishable evolution characteristics: one is that the string breaks and the system enters a superposition state space containing multiple meson state configurations; the other is localized string dynamics, in which the string undergoes local breaking but can then recombine and return to a state close to the initial structure, with the breaking and recombination processes recurring over a long time scale. Through the analysis of the evolution of different meson state configurations, we visually depict the redistribution of configuration weights during the string breaking process, and reveal the observable recovery characteristics of the string after breaking. Further analysis shows that the enhancement of quantum fluctuations can increase the weight of the double-meson state configurations in the system wave function without changing the dominant dynamical behavior. The above results present a rich picture of string breaking dynamics in a one-dimensional Rydberg atomic chain and provide insights for studying confinement physics and related gauge field theory phenomena on quantum simulation platforms.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04141v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Restoring Sparsity in Potts Machines via Mean-Field Constraints</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04200</link><description>arXiv:2602.04200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ising machines and related probabilistic hardware have emerged as promising platforms for NP-hard optimization and sampling. However, many practical problems involve constraints that induce dense or all-to-all couplings, undermining scalability and hardware efficiency. We address this constraint-induced density through two complementary approaches. First, we introduce a hardware-aware native formulation for multi-state probabilistic digits (p-dits) that avoids the locally dense intra-variable couplings required by binary Ising encodings. We validate p-dit dynamics by reproducing known critical behavior of the 2D Potts model. Second, we propose mean-field constraints (MFC), a hybrid scheme that replaces dense pairwise constraint couplings with dynamically updated single-node biases. Applied to balanced graph partitioning, MFC achieves solution quality comparable to exact all-to-all constraint formulations while dramatically reducing graph density. Finally, we demonstrate the practical impact of restored sparsity by an FPGA implementation, enabling orders-of-magnitude acceleration over CPU-based solvers. Together, these results outline a pathway for scaling constrained optimization on probabilistic hardware.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04200v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Piezomagnetic transport in van der Waals noncoplanar Antiferromagnets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04245</link><description>arXiv:2602.04245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The piezomagnetic effect-strain-induced linear modulation of magnetization, arises in magnets with broken time-reversal symmetry (BTRS), offering a pathway to bidirectional strain-based control of magnetism, which is an essential straintronic and spintronic functionality in solids. Metallic antiferromagnets with BTRS provide an ideal platform to study this effect through transport measurements, yet experimental demonstrations are limited. Van der Waals (vdW) nanomagnets, with their mechanical flexibility, are particularly promising for realizing large piezomagnetic responses and effective transport control. Here we demonstrate piezomagnetic control of electronic transport in nano-devices of the vdW antiferromagnets CoNb$_3$S$_6$ and CoTa$_3$S$_6$, archetypal vdW metals with BTRS that exhibit a spontaneous Hall effect. Applying uniaxial strain linearly modulates both the antiferromagnetic transition temperature and coercive field, consistent with strain-driven tuning of exchange coupling, key signatures of the piezomagnetic effect. Moreover, spontaneous Hall effect is controllable via strain, evidencing piezomagnetic tuning of Berry curvature and its associated geometric transport. These findings establish piezomagnetism as a powerful route to manipulate antiferromagnetic transport, opening avenues for straintronic and spintronic applications in vdW magnetic systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04245v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Revealing the interfacial kinetic mechanisms in high-entropy doped Na$_3$V$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ through electrochemical investigation and distribution of relaxation times</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04372</link><description>arXiv:2602.04372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We designed a high-entropy doped NASICON cathode, Na$_3$V$_{1.9}$(CrMoAlZrNi)$_{0.1}$(PO$_4$)$_3$ and investigate its electrochemical performance for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) to understand the diffusion mechanism including distribution of relaxation times analysis of interfacial kinetics. This trace doping induces high-entropy mixing at the vanadium site, tuning the lattice and enhancing specific capacity, activating V$^{4+}$/V$^{5+}$ redox couple 3.95~V. Interestingly, it delivers a reversible capacity of 119~mAh~g$^{-1}$ at 0.1~C, and demonstrate excellent stability of 68\% after 1000 cycles at 10~C. The calculated diffusion coefficient values are found within the range of \(10^{-11}\)--\(10^{-13}~\mathrm{cm^2\,s^{-1}}\). The systematic investigation of temperature and voltage-dependent impedance data using the distribution of relaxation times provides deeper insights into the underlying charge-transfer and transport processes. The full cells with hard carbon delivers 326~Wh~kg$^{-1}$ (with respect to cathode mass) at $\approx$3.2~V and retained $\sim$79\% capacity after 100 cycles at 2~C. Our study opens new avenues for developing high-entropy doped cathodes for enhanced structural stability, extended redox activity, and optimized electrochemical kinetics for practical implementation of SIBs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04372v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Transport Properties of Active Particles Moving on Adjustable Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04732</link><description>arXiv:2602.04732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active adaptive matter has attracted considerable interest due to its rich, largely unexplained dynamics and its relevance to a wide range of synthetic and biological materials. An important subclass of such systems consists of active particles that can remodel the network in which they move. Here, we introduce a minimal yet versatile model of active particles moving on an adjustable network. In this model, particles undergo discrete run-and-tumble motion along the links of a triangular lattice and leave behind a trail of temporarily blocked links. These closed links cannot be traversed by other particles and reopen only after a characteristic healing time. The resulting trail-mediated blocking mechanism is fundamentally distinct from more familiar interactions such as excluded-volume effects. In the high-persistence limit, we find a qualitative contrast between the two mechanisms: while steric blocking leads to reduced diffusivity with increasing persistence, trail-induced blocking causes diffusivity to increase monotonically. We characterize this fundamental difference and the associated, unexpected transport properties, and discuss potential applications of our findings.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04732v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dimensional crossover of bound complexes in a two-species Bose-Hubbard lattice: correlations and dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04741</link><description>arXiv:2602.04741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the equilibrium and nonequilibrium formation of four-particle complexes in a balanced two-species Bose-Hubbard model with repulsive intra- and attractive inter-species interactions. Using exact diagonalization, we characterize the transition from weakly- to strongly-correlated dimer and tetramer states along the one- to two-dimensional crossover in coupled-chain geometries by combining local correlation signatures with global diagnostics such as the binding energy and interspecies entanglement entropy. We show that transverse connectivity between chains qualitatively reshapes the phase diagram, substantially enlarging the tetramer region and, in particular, stabilizing weakly bound tetramers when compared to the one-dimensional chains. By tuning the interchain hopping, we identify a transition from a degenerate manifold of spatially separated dimers to a localized tetramer ground state, driven by the lifting of one-dimensional configurational degeneracies and an associated kinetic-energy gain. Finally, we demonstrate interaction and geometric quench protocols to dynamically prepare these complexes with high fidelity. Our results provide a microscopic framework for engineering and probing few-body bosonic bound states in tunable lattice geometries.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04741v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A brief review of evolutionary game dynamics in the reinforcement learning paradigm</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04150</link><description>arXiv:2602.04150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperation, fairness, trust, and resource coordination are cornerstones of modern civilization, yet their emergence remains inadequately explained by the persistent discrepancies between theoretical predictions and behavioral experiments. Part of this gap may arise from the imitation learning paradigm commonly used in prior theoretical models, which assumes individuals merely copy successful neighbors according to predetermined, fixed rules. This review examines recent advances in evolutionary game dynamics that employ reinforcement learning (RL) as an alternative paradigm. In RL, individuals learn through trial and error and introspectively refine their strategies based on environmental feedback. We begin by introducing key concepts in evolutionary game theory and the two learning paradigms, then synthesize progress in applying RL to elucidate cooperation, trust, fairness, optimal resource coordination, and ecological dynamics. Collectively, these studies indicate that RL offers a promising unified framework for understanding the diverse social and ecological phenomena observed in human and natural systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04150v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Theory of Speciation Transitions in Diffusion Models with General Class Structure</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04404</link><description>arXiv:2602.04404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Models generate data by reversing a stochastic diffusion process, progressively transforming noise into structured samples drawn from a target distribution. Recent theoretical work has shown that this backward dynamics can undergo sharp qualitative transitions, known as speciation transitions, during which trajectories become dynamically committed to data classes. Existing theoretical analyses, however, are limited to settings where classes are identifiable through first moments, such as mixtures of Gaussians with well-separated means. In this work, we develop a general theory of speciation in diffusion models that applies to arbitrary target distributions admitting well-defined classes. We formalize the notion of class structure through Bayes classification and characterize speciation times in terms of free-entropy difference between classes. This criterion recovers known results in previously studied Gaussian-mixture models, while extending to situations in which classes are not distinguishable by first moments and may instead differ through higher-order or collective features. Our framework also accommodates multiple classes and predicts the existence of successive speciation times associated with increasingly fine-grained class commitment. We illustrate the theory on two analytically tractable examples: mixtures of one-dimensional Ising models at different temperatures and mixtures of zero-mean Gaussians with distinct covariance structures. In the Ising case, we obtain explicit expressions for speciation times by mapping the problem onto a random-field Ising model and solving it via the replica method. Our results provide a unified and broadly applicable description of speciation transitions in diffusion-based generative models.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04404v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions in Boundary Time Crystals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04792</link><description>arXiv:2602.04792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of a dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) in a dissipative collective-spin model that exhibits the boundary time crystal (BTC) phase. We initialize the system in the ground state of the Hamiltonian in either the BTC or the non-BTC phase, and drive it across the BTC transition. The driving is done by an abrupt quench or by a finite-time linear ramp of a Hamiltonian control parameter under Markovian Lindblad dynamics. We diagnose DQPTs through zeros of the fidelity-based Loschmidt echo between the initial state and the evolving mixed state, which induce nonanalytic cusp-like features in the associated rate function. For quenches into the BTC phase, the Loschmidt echo exhibits repeated zeros due to the emergent time-periodic steady state, whereas for quenches into the non-BTC phase, the overlap vanishes and remains zero once the dynamics relaxes to a stationary state. We further show that the DQPT persists under the ramp protocol followed by unitary evolution with the final Hamiltonian. Finally, we analyze the finite-size scaling of the first critical time and find convergence to a constant in the thermodynamic limit, with distinct power-law approaches for the quench and the ramp protocols.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04792v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spin-momentum Locking and Topological Vector Charge Response with Conserved Spin</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03301</link><description>arXiv:2304.03301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-momentum locking plays a fundamental role in spintronics and, more broadly, is an important concept in condensed matter physics. In 2D and 3D, spin-momentum locking typically does not allow spin-conservation because the spin-1/2 operators of electrons anticommute. Instead, here we study spin-momentum locking terms with conserved, commuting pseudospins built from a combination of spin and orbitals. We find that 2D spin-momentum locking terms with conserved pseudospins generally lead to linearly dispersing modes at low-energy with anomalous charge and pseudospin currents. To cure the anomaly we show that such anomalous modes can be realized on the surface of a 3D Weyl semimetal (or an associated weak topological insulator) with a nonzero mixed spin-momentum quadrupole moment, which is determined by the momentum location and pseudospin eigenvalues of Weyl points at the Fermi level. Crucially, this mixed quadrupole moment captures a mixed pseudospin-charge bulk response that cancels the anomaly of surface modes, and can generate a giant 3D spin Hall effect, among other phenomena.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2304.03301v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Deterministic scale-invariant dynamics in a logistic Game-of-Life model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07189</link><description>arXiv:2411.07189v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scale invariance is a hallmark of criticality in complex dynamical systems. While random external inputs or tunable stochastic interactions are typically required to produce critical behavior, it remains unclear whether scale-invariant dynamics can emerge from purely deterministic interactions. Here, we address this question by studying the asymptotic dynamics of the logistic Game of Life (GOL), a deterministic-parameter extension of Conway's GOL. In this system, we identify three distinct asymptotic phases separated by two fundamentally different critical points. The first critical point, associated with an unusual form of self-organized criticality, separates a sparse-static phase from a sparse-dynamic phase. The second critical point corresponds to a deterministic percolation transition between the sparse-dynamic phase and a third, dense-dynamic phase. In addition, we observe power-law cluster size distributions with unconventional critical exponents not found in standard equilibrium systems. Overall, our work paves the way for studying emergent scale invariance in purely deterministic systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.07189v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interplay of localization and topology in disordered dimerized array of Rydberg atoms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07720</link><description>arXiv:2505.07720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg tweezer arrays provide a platform for realizing spin-1/2 Hamiltonians with long-range tunneling that decays as a power law with distance. We numerically investigate the effects of positional disorder and dimerization on the properties of excited states in such a one-dimensional system. Our model allows for continuous tuning of both the dimerization pattern and the disorder strength. Within the parameter space constrained by our geometry, we show that both mechanisms lead to a localized phase that does not resemble standard MBL. This phase can be understood as an ensemble of distinct Hilbert space fragmented realizations induced by small inter-spin separations. As dimerization is commonly associated with Symmetry Protected Topological (SPT) physics, we also examine the SPT states across the entire energy spectrum. Despite a partial spin-glass order, we argue that the system hosts an extensive fraction of SPT states.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.07720v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Crossover between intrinsic and temperature-assisted regimes in spin-orbit torque switching of antiferromagnetic order</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27138</link><description>arXiv:2510.27138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intensive studies have been made on antiferromagnets as candidate materials for next generation memory bits due to their ultrafast dynamics reaching picosecond time scales. Recent demonstrations of electrical bidirectional switching of antiferromagnetic states have attracted significant attention. However, under the presence of significant Joule heating that destabilizes the magnetic order, the timescales associated with the switching can be limited to nanoseconds or longer. Here, we present the observation of a crossover in the switching behavior of the chiral antiferromagnet Mn3Sn by tuning the magnetic layer thickness. While Joule heating interferes with switching in thicker devices, we find clear signatures of an intrinsic spin-orbit torque mechanism as the thickness is reduced, avoiding the heating effect. The suppression of heating enables switching without significant attenuation of the readout signal using pulses shorter than those required by temperature-assisted mechanisms. The crossover into the spin-orbit torque switching behavior clarifies the potential for achieving ultrafast switching as expected from the picosecond spin dynamics of antiferromagnets. Our results lay the groundwork for designing antiferromagnetic memory devices that can operate at ultrafast timescales.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.27138v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Polymer-assisted wet-chemical synthesis and characterization of zinc sulphide nanoparticles by hydrothermal and co-precipitation methods</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07554</link><description>arXiv:2601.07554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zinc sulphide (ZnS) is a non-toxic, wide-bandgap II-VI semiconductor with well-established optoelectronic properties. In this work, ZnS quantum dots (QDs) were synthesized using polymer-assisted wet-chemical routes, namely hydrothermal processing and room-temperature co-precipitation. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) were employed as capping agents to investigate their influence on particle growth, dispersion, and optical behaviour. Room-temperature co-precipitation produced ZnS QDs with crystallite sizes as small as 2.03 nm, whereas hydrothermal synthesis at elevated temperature resulted in larger crystallites exceeding approximately 6 nm. X-ray diffraction confirmed the formation of cubic zinc-blende ZnS in all samples, with peak broadening and minor lattice parameter variations associated with nanoscale dimensions. UV-visible absorption spectra exhibited systematic shifts in the absorption edge, with optical bandgap values ranging from 3.60 eV to 3.80 eV, consistent with size-dependent quantum confinement effects. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering measurements verified effective polymer capping and particle size distribution, with PVP providing stronger growth suppression and improved dispersion compared to PEG. These results provide insight into the role of polymer-nanocrystal interactions in wet-chemical synthesis and demonstrate how synthesis route and polymer chemistry influence the structural and optical properties of ZnS nanoparticles.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07554v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Crypto-RV: High-Efficiency FPGA-Based RISC-V Cryptographic Co-Processor for IoT Security</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04415</link><description>arXiv:2602.04415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryptographic operations are critical for securing IoT, edge computing, and autonomous systems. However, current RISC-V platforms lack efficient hardware support for comprehensive cryptographic algorithm families and post-quantum cryptography. This paper presents Crypto-RV, a RISC-V co-processor architecture that unifies support for SHA-256, SHA-512, SM3, SHA3-256, SHAKE-128, SHAKE-256 AES-128, HARAKA-256, and HARAKA-512 within a single 64-bit datapath. Crypto-RV introduces three key architectural innovations: a high-bandwidth internal buffer (128x64-bit), cryptography-specialized execution units with four-stage pipelined datapaths, and a double-buffering mechanism with adaptive scheduling optimized for large-hash. Implemented on Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA at 160 MHz with 0.851 W dynamic power, Crypto-RV achieves 165 times to 1,061 times speedup over baseline RISC-V cores, 5.8 times to 17.4 times better energy efficiency compared to powerful CPUs. The design occupies only 34,704 LUTs, 37,329 FFs, and 22 BRAMs demonstrating viability for high-performance, energy-efficient cryptographic processing in resource-constrained IoT environments.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04415v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] A Parameterizable Convolution Accelerator for Embedded Deep Learning Applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04044</link><description>arXiv:2602.04044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolutional neural network (CNN) accelerators implemented on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are typically designed with a primary focus on maximizing performance, often measured in giga-operations per second (GOPS). However, real-life embedded deep learning (DL) applications impose multiple constraints related to latency, power consumption, area, and cost. This work presents a hardware-software (HW/SW) co-design methodology in which a CNN accelerator is described using high-level synthesis (HLS) tools that ease the parameterization of the design, facilitating more effective optimizations across multiple design constraints. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed design methodology is able to outperform non-parameterized design approaches, and it can be easily extended to other types of DL applications.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04044v1</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Environmental and societal costs of maize production decrease by addressing the uncertainty in nitrogen rate recommendations</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68988-y</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 05 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68988-y"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-68988-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Excess nitrogen fertilization in maize production harms the environment and society, yet farmers face yield risks when reducing inputs.

Abstract: Quantum criticality in the presence of strong quenched randomness remains a challenging topic in modern condensed matter theory. We show that the topology and anomaly associated with average symmetry can be used to predict certain nontrivial universal properties. Our focus is on systems subject to average Lieb--Schultz--Mattis constraints, where lattice translation symmetry is preserved only on average, while on-site symmetries remain exact. We argue that in the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking, the system must exhibit critical correlations of local operators in two distinct ways: (i) for some operator $O_e$ charged under exact symmetries, the first absolute moment correlation $\overline{|\langle O_e(x)O^{\dagger}_e(y)\rangle|}$ decays slowly; and (ii) for some operator $O_a$ charged under average symmetries, the first-moment correlation $\overline{\langle O_a(x)O^{\dagger}_a(y)\rangle}$ decays slowly. We verify these predictions in a few examples: the random-singlet Heisenberg spin chain in one dimension, and the disordered free-fermion critical states in symmetry class BDI in one and two dimensions. Surprisingly, even for these well-studied systems, our anomaly-based argument reveals critical correlations overlooked in previous literature. We also discuss the experimental feasibility of measuring these critical correlations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02648v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Revealing Short- and Long-range Li-ion diffusion in Li$_2$MnO$_3$ from finite-temperature dynamical mean field theory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02807</link><description>arXiv:2602.02807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Li$_2$MnO$_3$ remains a crucial component of the Li-excess layered cathode family, $(1-x)\,\mathrm{LiMO_2} + x\,\mathrm{Li_2MnO_3}$ ($M$ = Mn, Ni, Co, \dots), but its role in limiting Li-ion mobility remains under debate. Here we combine DFT+$U$, finite-temperature DMFT with a continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo impurity solver, and nudged-elastic-band (NEB) calculations to investigate Li$^+$ migration for a single Li vacancy in paramagnetic Li$_2$MnO$_3$. Dynamical electronic correlations within DMFT substantially reduce the activation energies of the lowest-barrier pathways, yielding $E_a = 0.18$ eV for the shortest-range Li jump and $E_a = 0.50$ eV for the next-lowest pathway. The 0.18 eV barrier quantitatively reproduces the short-range activation energy extracted from $\mu^+$SR measurements, whereas the 0.50 eV barrier is consistent with the long-range transport activation energy obtained from ac-impedance measurements. This single-vacancy, paramagnetic DMFT description therefore provides a coherent explanation of both local and macroscopic probes without requiring highly clustered vacancy configurations or strong extrinsic disorder, an assumption compatible with nearly stoichiometric Li$_2$MnO$_3$ powders. Our results highlight the importance of finite-temperature dynamical correlations for Li-ion migration in correlated oxides and provide a framework for incorporating strong Coulomb interactions in future studies of transition-metal oxide battery materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02807v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Violation of local equilibrium thermodynamics in one-dimensional Hamiltonian-Potts model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02946</link><description>arXiv:2602.02946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate non-equilibrium phase coexistence associated with a first-order phase transition by numerically studying a one-dimensional Hamiltonian-Potts model with fractional spatial derivatives. The fractional derivative is introduced so as to reproduce the low-wavenumber density of states of the standard two-dimensional model, allowing phase coexistence to occur in a minimal one-dimensional setting under steady heat conduction. By imposing a constant heat flux through boundary heat baths, we observe stable coexistence of ordered and disordered phases separated by a stationary interface. We find that the temperature at the interface systematically deviates from the equilibrium transition temperature, demonstrating a clear violation of the local equilibrium description. This deviation indicates that equilibrium metastable states can be stabilized and controlled by a steady heat current. Furthermore, the interface temperature obtained in our simulations is in quantitative agreement with the prediction of global thermodynamics for non-equilibrium steady states. These results confirm that the breakdown of local equilibrium and the stabilization of metastable states are intrinsic features of non-equilibrium first-order phase transitions, independent of spatial dimensionality. Our study thus provides a minimal and controlled numerical model for exploring the fundamental limits of thermodynamic descriptions in non-equilibrium steady states.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02946v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Calculating Feynman diagrams with matrix product states</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03598</link><description>arXiv:2602.03598v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of a laser-pumped two-dimensional spinless Holstein model within a semiclassical framework, focusing on the melting and recovery of long-range charge-density-wave order. Accurately describing this process requires fully nonadiabatic electron-lattice dynamics, which is computationally demanding due to the need to resolve fast electronic motion over long time scales. By analyzing the structure of the lattice force during nonequilibrium evolution, we show that the force naturally separates into a smooth quasi-adiabatic component and a residual bath-like contribution associated with fast electronic fluctuations. The quasi-adiabatic component depends only on the instantaneous local lattice configuration and can be efficiently learned using machine-learning techniques, while a minimal Langevin description of the bath term captures the essential features of the recovery dynamics. Combining these elements enables efficient and scalable simulations of long-time nonequilibrium dynamics on large lattices, providing a practical route to access driven correlated systems beyond the reach of direct nonadiabatic approaches.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03761v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spin and Charge Conductivity in the Square Lattice Fermi-Hubbard Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03771</link><description>arXiv:2602.03771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical properties are notoriously difficult to compute in numerical treatments of the Fermi-Hubbard model, especially in two spatial dimensions. However, they are essential in providing us with insight into some of the most important and less well-understood phases of the model, such as the pseudogap and strange metal phases at relatively high temperatures, or unconventional superconductivity at lower temperatures, away from the commensurate filling. Here, we use the numerical linked-cluster expansions to compute spin and charge optical conductivities of the model at different temperatures and strong interaction strengths via the exact real-time-dependent correlation functions of the current operators. We mitigate systematic errors associated with having a limited access to the long-time behavior of the correlators by introducing fits and allowing for non-zero Drude weights when appropriate. We compare our results to available data from optical lattice experiments and find that the Drude contributions can account for the theory-experiment gap in the DC spin conductivity of the model at half filling in the strong-coupling region. Our method helps paint a more complete picture of the conductivity in the two-dimensional Hubbard model and opens the door to studying dynamical properties of quantum lattice models in the thermodynamic limit.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03771v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Emergent correlations in the selected link-times along optimal paths</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03800</link><description>arXiv:2602.03800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of first-passage percolation (FPP), we investigate the statistical properties of the selected link-times (SLTs) -the random link times comprising the optimal paths (or geodesics) connecting two given points. We focus on weakly disordered square lattices, whose geodesics are known to fall under the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. Our analysis reveals universal power-law decays with the end-to-end distance for both the average and standard deviation of the SLTs, along with an intricate pattern of long-range correlations, whose scaling exponents are directly linked to KPZ universality. Crucially, the SLT distributions for diagonal and axial paths exhibit significant differences, which we trace back to the distinct directed and undirected nature, respectively, of the underlying geodesics. Moreover, we demonstrate that the SLT distribution violates the conditions of the central limit theorem. Instead, SLT sums follow the Tracy-Widom distribution characteristic of the KPZ class, which we associate with evidence for the emergence of high-order long-range correlations in the ensemble.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03800v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Temperature driven false vacuum decay in coherently coupled Bose superfluids</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03834</link><description>arXiv:2602.03834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relaxation of a quantum field from a metastable state (false vacuum) to a stable one (true vacuum), also known as false vacuum decay, is a fundamental problem in quantum field theory and cosmology. We study this phenomenon using a two-dimensional interacting and coherently coupled Bose-Bose mixture, a platform that has already been employed experimentally to investigate false vacuum decay in one dimension. In such a mixture, it is possible to define an effective magnetization that acts as a quantum field variable. Using the Stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SGPE), we prepare thermal equilibrium states in the false vacuum and extract decay rates from the magnetization dynamics. The decay rates show an exponential dependence on temperature, in line with the thermal theory of instantons. Since the SGPE is based on complex scalar fields, it also allows us to explore the behavior of the phase, which turns out to become dynamic during decay. Our results confirm the SGPE as an effective tool for studying coupled magnetization and phase dynamics and the associated instanton physics in ultracold quantum gases.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03834v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Equilibrium measures for higher dimensional rotationally symmetric Riesz gases</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03047</link><description>arXiv:2602.03047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study equilibrium measures for Riesz gases in dimension $d$ with pairwise interaction kernel $|x-y|^{-s}$, subject to radially symmetric external fields. We characterise broad classes of confining potentials for which the equilibrium measure is supported on the unit ball and admits an explicit density. Our main contribution is a converse construction: starting from a prescribed radially symmetric equilibrium density given as a power series in the squared radius, we determine the associated external potential and establish the corresponding Euler-Lagrange variational conditions. A key ingredient in the proof is an identity between two ${}_3F_2$ hypergeometric functions evaluated at unit argument, which is of independent interest. As applications, we identify the external potentials corresponding to equilibrium densities proportional to $(1-|x|^2)^\alpha$, $\alpha&gt;-1$, and show that these potentials can be expressed in terms of Gauss hypergeometric functions ${}_2F_1$, reducing to polynomials for special values of $\alpha$. We also determine the equilibrium measure associated with purely power-type external potentials, often referred to as Freud or Mittag--Leffler potentials in the context of log gases, for which the equilibrium density admits an explicit ${}_2F_1$ representation. Furthermore, we apply our framework to a Coulomb gas in dimension $d+1$ confined by a harmonic potential to the half-space. We derive a necessary condition under which the equilibrium measure is fully supported on the boundary hyperplane of dimension $d$, with the induced density corresponding to that of a Riesz gas with exponent $s=d-1$.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03047v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Gauging Modulated Symmetries via Multiple Gauge Symmetry Operators and Adaptive Quantum Circuits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15834</link><description>arXiv:2503.15834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an extended framework for the simultaneous gauging of modulated symmetries in $(d+1)$ dimensions, employing {\it multiple} gauge symmetry operators whose corresponding gauging procedures must be carried out simultaneously. Simultaneous gauging can capture a broader class of dualities than sequential gauging, the latter corresponding to the conventional gauging applied in successive steps. In general, performing simultaneous gauging and conventional gauging in sequence constitutes the most general framework for gauging modulated symmetries. We further show that the associated duality transformations can be implemented via adaptive state preparation protocols. As a concrete example, we consider a dipole symmetry in $(2+1)$D and illustrate both the simultaneous gauging procedure and the adaptive preparation protocol. Interestingly, we find that the intermediate state of the simultaneous gauging/adaptive circuit corresponds to a symmetry-protected topological phase protected by the dipole bundle symmetry. Finally, we utilize the duality to analyze the phase diagram of the rank-2 toric code under transverse fields.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.15834v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Generalized Tube Algebras, Symmetry-Resolved Partition Functions, and Twisted Boundary States</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02159</link><description>arXiv:2409.02159v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of generalized tube algebras which describe how finite, non-invertible global symmetries of bosonic 1+1d QFTs act on operators which sit at the intersection point of a collection of boundaries and interfaces. We develop a 2+1d symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT) picture of boundaries and interfaces which, among other things, allows us to deduce the representation theory of these algebras. In particular, we initiate the study of a character theory, echoing that of finite groups, and demonstrate how many representation-theoretic quantities can be expressed as partition functions of the SymTFT on various backgrounds, which in turn can be evaluated explicitly in terms of generalized half-linking numbers. We use this technology to explain how the torus and annulus partition functions of a 1+1d QFT can be refined with information about its symmetries. We are led to a vast generalization of Ishibashi states in CFT: to any multiplet of conformal boundary conditions which transform into each other under the action of a symmetry, we associate a collection of generalized Ishibashi states, in terms of which the twisted sector boundary states of the theory and all of its orbifolds can be obtained as linear combinations. We derive a generalized Verlinde formula involving the characters of the boundary tube algebra which ensures that our formulas for the twisted sector boundary states respect open-closed duality. Our approach does not rely on rationality or the existence of an extended chiral algebra; however, in the special case of a diagonal RCFT with chiral algebra $V$ and modular tensor category $\mathscr{C}$, our formalism produces explicit closed-form expressions - in terms of the $F$-symbols and $R$-matrices of $\mathscr{C}$, and the characters of $V$ - for the twisted Cardy states, and the torus and annulus partition functions decorated by Verlinde lines.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2409.02159v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] TurboFuzz: FPGA Accelerated Hardware Fuzzing for Processor Agile Verification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10400</link><description>arXiv:2509.10400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Verification is a critical process for ensuring the correctness of modern processors. The increasing complexity of processor designs and the emergence of new instruction set architectures (ISAs) like RISC-V have created demands for more agile and efficient verification methodologies, particularly regarding verification efficiency and faster coverage convergence. While simulation-based approaches now attempt to incorporate advanced software testing techniques such as fuzzing to improve coverage, they face significant limitations when applied to processor verification, notably poor performance and inadequate test case quality. Hardware-accelerated solutions using FPGA or ASIC platforms have tried to address these issues, yet they struggle with challenges including host-FPGA communication overhead, inefficient test pattern generation, and suboptimal implementation of the entire multi-step verification process.
  In this paper, we present TurboFuzz, an end-to-end hardware-accelerated verification framework that implements the entire Test Generation-Simulation-Coverage Feedback loop on a single FPGA for modern processor verification. TurboFuzz enhances test quality through optimized test case (seed) control flow, efficient inter-seed scheduling, and hybrid fuzzer integration, thereby improving coverage and execution efficiency. Additionally, it employs a feedback-driven generation mechanism to accelerate coverage convergence. Experimental results show that TurboFuzz achieves up to 2.23x more coverage collection than software-based fuzzers within the same time budget, and up to 571x performance speedup when detecting real-world issues, while maintaining full visibility and debugging capabilities with moderate area overhead.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.10400v2</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Predator-prey temporal niche partitioning under human disturbance: a meta-analysis</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69113-9</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 04 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69113-9"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-69113-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Humans alter the daily timing of animal activity, potentially reshaping predator–prey interactions.

Optical frequency combs enable technologies ranging from timing, LiDAR, and ultra-stable signal sources. Microwave frequency combs are analogous to optical frequency combs, but often leverage electronic nonlinearity for comb generation. Generating microwave frequency combs using piezoelectric mechanical resonators would enable this behavior in a more compact form factor, thanks to the shorter acoustic wavelengths. In this work, we demonstrate a microwave frequency comb leveraging thermal nonlinearity in high quality factor (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Q&lt;/span&gt;), overmoded acoustic resonators in thin-film lithium niobate. By providing input power at 257 MHz, which is the sum frequency of two acoustic modes at 86 and 171 MHz, we generate parametric downconversion and comb generation. We explore the nonlinear mixing regimes and the associated conditions for comb generation. Comb spacing is observed to vary significantly with drive frequency and power, and its general behavior is found to rely heavily on initial conditions. This demonstration showcases the potential for further improvement in compact and efficient microwave frequency combs, leveraging nonlinear acoustic resonators.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/5/052201/3378622/Phononic-combs-in-lithium-niobate-acoustic</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Nanoscale carrier distribution and trap dynamics in supported and suspended WSe 2  layers studied by scanning nonlinear dielectric microscopy</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/5/052101/3378620/Nanoscale-carrier-distribution-and-trap-dynamics</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;The unique electronic and optical properties of atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides make them promising candidates for advanced device applications. However, their electrical characteristics are strongly influenced by the interfacial and dielectric environments provided by the substrate. To elucidate these substrate-related properties, microscopy techniques with high spatial resolution are essential. Among these techniques, scanning nonlinear dielectric microscopy (SNDM) has emerged as a powerful tool for visualizing dominant carrier distributions in semiconductor materials. In this study, we employ SNDM to investigate two types of mechanically exfoliated WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; samples: one supported on a SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; substrate and the other suspended over nanoscale Au wires. Our findings reveal spatial and bias-dependent differences in carrier behavior between the two structures. Specifically, the suspended WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits reduced hysteresis and a more symmetric ambipolar response, consistent with the suppression of charge trapping at interface states. To further probe the fast dynamic responses associated with interface states, we also conduct local deep level transient spectroscopy measurements using time-resolved SNDM.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/5/052101/3378620/Nanoscale-carrier-distribution-and-trap-dynamics</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Shift of quantum critical point of discrete time crystal on a noisy quantum simulator</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/5/054002/3378610/Shift-of-quantum-critical-point-of-discrete-time</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Recent advances in quantum technology have enabled the simulation of quantum many-body systems on real quantum devices. However, such quantum simulators are inherently subject to decoherence, and their impact on system dynamics—particularly near quantum phase transitions—remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we experimentally investigate how decoherence in quantum devices affects the dynamics of quantum time crystals, using a 156-qubit IBM Quantum system. We find that decoherence shifts the location of critical behavior associated with the phase transition, suggesting that noisy simulations can lead to inaccurate identification of phase boundaries. Our results underscore the importance of understanding and mitigating decoherence to reliably simulate quantum many-body systems on near-term quantum hardware.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/5/054002/3378610/Shift-of-quantum-critical-point-of-discrete-time</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Machine learning-based time-series forecasting prevents electrode corrosion in organic electrochemistry</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2026/DD/D5DD00458F</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/image/GA?id=D5DD00458F" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2026, Advance Article&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00458F, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY-NC.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Josef Tausendschön, Michael Poelzl, Nikola Petrovic, Jason D.

Abstract: Spider silk is a remarkable biomaterial with exceptional stiffness, strength, and toughness stemming from a unique microstructure. While recent studies show that silk fibers exhibit plasticity, hysteresis, and recovery under cyclic loading, the underlying microstructural mechanisms are not yet fully understood. In this work, we propose a mechanism explaining the loading-unloading-relaxation response through microstructural evolution: initial loading distorts intermolecular bonds, resulting in a linear elastic regime. Upon reaching the yield stress, these bonds dissociate and the external load is transferred to the polypeptide chains, which deform entropically to allow large deformations. Unloading is driven by entropic shortening until a traction free state with residual stretch is achieved. Subsequently, the fiber recovers as chains reorganize and bonds reform, locking the microstructure into a new stable equilibrium that increases stiffness in subsequent cycles. Following these mechanisms, we develop a microscopically motivated, energy-based model that captures the macroscopic response of silk fibers under cyclic loading. The response is decoupled into two parallel networks: (1) an elasto-plastic network of inter- and intramolecular bonds governing the initial stiffness and yield stress, and (2) an elastic network of entropic chains that enable large deformations. The model is validated against experimental data from Argiope bruennichi dragline silk. The findings from this work are three-fold: (1) explaining the mechanisms that govern hysteresis and recovery and linking them to microstructural evolution; (2) quantifying the recovery process of the fiber, which restores and enhances mechanical properties; and (3) establishing a predictive foundation for engineering synthetic fibers with customized properties.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00147v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Deriving Reliable Nucleation Rates from Metadynamics Simulations: Application to Yukawa Fluids</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00354</link><description>arXiv:2602.00354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to solidify the usefulness of metadynamics in studying nucleation of crystals from supercooled liquids, we provide a specific procedure to calculate nucleation free energy barriers. After a pedagogical review of the important elements of classical nucleation theory and how metadynamics is used to find nucleation free energy barriers, we explain the benefits of local collective variables over more common global collective variables. We show how a metadynamics free energy barrier must be carefully postprocessed so that classical nucleation theory can be applied to calculate nucleation rates. We apply our procedure to a Yukawa plasma and show that a particular physically-motivated fit to metadynamics data reproduces low-temperature reference data, justifying the usefulness of metadynamics to predict nucleation rates and the nucleation critical temperature.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00354v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Floquet quantum geometry in periodically driven topological insulators</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00569</link><description>arXiv:2602.00569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum geometry plays a fundamental role across many branches of modern physics, yet its full characterization in nonequilibrium systems remains a challenge. Here, we propose a framework for quantum geometry in Floquet topological insulators by introducing a time-resolved quantum metric tensor, defined via the trace distance between micromotion operators in momentum-time space. For class A in two spatial dimensions, we find a general inequality linking the Floquet quantum metric tensor and the Floquet topology: the associated quantum volume is bounded below by the Floquet topological invariant. This relation is found to also hold in class AIII in one dimension, where the Floquet geometric tensor may be notably reduced due to time-reflection symmetry. This work will be useful in digesting the general aspects of quantum geometry in periodically driven systems in connection with their topological characterization.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00569v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Leaves of preferential attachment trees</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01021</link><description>arXiv:2602.01021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a local probabilistic description of the limiting statistics of large preferential attachment trees in terms of the ordinary degree (number of neighbors) but augmented with information on leafdegree (number of neighbors that are leaves). The full description is the joint degree-leafdegree distribution $n_{k,\ell}$, which we derive from its associated multivariate generating function. From $n_{k,\ell}$ we obtain the leafdegree distribution, $m_{\ell}$, as well as the fraction of vertices that are protected (nonleaves with leafdegree zero) as a function of degree, $n_{k,0}$, among numerous other results. We also examine fluctuations and concentration of joint degree-leafdegree empirical counts $N_{k,\ell}$. Although our main findings pertain to the preferential attachment tree, the approach we present is highly generalizable and can characterize numerous existing models, in addition to facilitating the development of tractable new models. We further demonstrate the approach by analyzing $n_{k,\ell}$ in two other models: the random recursive tree, and a redirection-based model.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01021v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Novel dynamical excitations and roton-based measurement of Cooper-pair momentum in a two-dimensional Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov superfluid on optical lattices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01280</link><description>arXiv:2602.01280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the center-of-mass (COM) momentum of Cooper pairs in unconventional superconductors or superfluids is a topic of great interest in condensed matter physics and ultracold atomic gases. Theoretically, we investigate the dynamical excitations of a two-dimensional spin-polarized attractive Hubbard model on a square optical lattice under an effective Zeeman field by computing the density and spin dynamical structure factors, focusing on phase transition from a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superfluid to an Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superfluid. In the FFLO superfluid, besides the phonon mode in the density channel, a low-energy bogolon mode emerges in the spin channel, which is associated with Bogoliubov quasiparticles on a Bogoliubov Fermi surface. Moreover, the dynamical excitations exhibit pronounced anisotropy in momentum space due to the finite COM momentum. At half filling, the roton mode around $[\pi,\pi]$ evolves from a point-like minimum into a ring structure shifted by the COM momentum across the BCS-FFLO transition, providing a roton-based protocol to extract the COM momentum. These predictions provide key insights for confirming the existence of FFLO superfluids and understanding their dynamical excitation spectra.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01280v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Superstable Geometry in Triadic Percolation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01374</link><description>arXiv:2602.01374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triadic percolation turns bond percolation into a dynamical problem governed by an effective one-dimensional unimodal map. We show that the geometry of superstable cycles provides a direct, map-agnostic probe of local nonlinearity: specifically, the distance from the map's maximum to a distinguished next-to-maximum point on the attracting $2^n$-cycle (which coincides with a preimage of the maximum at $2^n$-superstability) scales as $|\Delta p|^{\gamma}$ with $\gamma = 1/z$, where $z$ is the nonflat order of the maximum. This prediction is verified across canonical unimodal families and heterogeneous triadic ensembles, with Lyapunov spectra corroborating the one-dimensional reduction. A derivative condition on the activation kernel fixes the local nonlinearity order $z$ (and thus, under standard unimodal-map hypotheses, the associated $z$-logistic universality class) and gives conditions under which $z&gt;2$ can be realized. The diagnostic operates directly on orbit data under standard regularity assumptions, providing a practical tool to classify universality in higher-order networks.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01374v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Thermophysical properties of spark plasma sintered UCo: a comparison with machine learning predictions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01896</link><description>arXiv:2602.01896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uranium dioxide has been widely used as a nuclear fuel in commercial light water reactors due to its high uranium density and chemical stability. However, its relatively low thermal conductivity is not optimal from the viewpoints of fuel integrity and safety margins, particularly during loss-of-coolant accidents. Although the development of accident-tolerant fuels with higher thermal conductivity is strongly desired, many potential uranium compounds remain unexplored due to constraints associated with handling radioactive materials. To efficiently screen promising uranium compounds with high thermal conductivity, past studies have leveraged machine-learning models to accelerate the discovery process. In this study, we experimentally examine the model's predictions by fabricating UCo and measuring its high-temperature thermophysical properties. Our results show that the thermal conductivity of UCo predicted by machine learning is in good agreement with the experimental measurements. Despite slight discrepancies, additional SHAP analysis suggests that the model's decision logic is consistent with known physical trends. Overall, this study fills a gap in reported thermophysical properties of UCo and provides experimental support for machine-learning-assisted screening of uranium compounds relevant to advanced fuel development.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01896v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Mechanics of incompatible asymmetric grain boundary migration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02387</link><description>arXiv:2602.02387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain boundary (GB) migration governs microstructure evolution and can mediate plastic deformation through sliding or shear coupling. Numerous experimental and numerical studies have reported a wide range of behaviors associated with boundary migration, such as defect emission or mode switching. Notably, recent studies have reported directionally asymmetric migration rates under symmetric loading, attributing this behavior to intrinsically asymmetric mobility; however, a mechanistic mesoscale explanation for this behavior remains lacking. In this work, we introduce a constitutive flow rule for grain-boundary eigendeformation within a multiphase-field framework, in which interfacial shear evolves in response to its mechanically conjugate driving force through the phase field Allen-Cahn equations. The formulation systematically employs regularized grain boundary shear kinematics informed by crystallography, and enables elastic compatibility to modulate boundary motion. Migration thresholds, residual back-stress, and apparent directional asymmetry appear naturally as emergent mechanical behavior. Simulations of symmetric and asymmetric tilt grain boundaries under mechanical, synthetic, and curvature-driven loading reveal persistent defect-like residuals following incompatible migration, transitions from planar motion to lamination at large inclinations, and even "ratcheting" behavior. These results provide a mechanically transparent explanation for behaviors such as effective mobility asymmetry and establish elastic compatibility as a constitutive mechanism in mesoscale models of boundary-mediated plasticity.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02387v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Nonlinear light cone spreading of correlations in a triangular quantum magnet: a hard quantum simulation target</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02433</link><description>arXiv:2602.02433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical correlations of quantum many-body systems are typically analyzed in the momentum space and frequency basis. However, quantum simulators operate more naturally in real space, real time settings. Here we analyze the real-space time-dependent van Hove spin correlations $G(r,t)$ of the 2D triangular antiferromagnet KYbSe$_2$ as obtained from high-resolution Fourier-transformed neutron spectroscopy. We compare this to $G(r,t)$ from five theoretical simulations of the well-established spin Hamiltonian. Our analysis reveals non-linear sub-ballistic low-temperature transport in KYbSe$_2$ which none of the current state-of-the-art numerical or field-theoretical methods reproduce. Our observation signals an emergent collective hydrodynamics, perhaps associated with the quantum critical phase of a quantum spin liquid, and provides an ideal benchmark for future quantum simulations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02433v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Fermionic magic resources in disordered quantum spin chains</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00245</link><description>arXiv:2602.00245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fermionic non-Gaussianity quantifies a quantum state's deviation from a classically tractable free-fermionic description, constituting a necessary resource for computational quantum advantage. Here we use fermionic antiflatness (FAF) to measure this deviation across ergodic and many-body localized (MBL) regimes. We focus on the paradigmatic disordered spin-$1\!/2$ XXZ chain and its impurity variant with local interactions. Across highly excited eigenstates, FAF evolves from typical-state behavior at weak disorder to strongly suppressed values deep in the MBL regime, with volume-law scaling in the XXZ chain and an area-law bound in the impurity setting. Rare long range catlike eigenstates exhibit a pronounced enhancement of FAF, making it a sensitive diagnostic of mechanisms proposed to destabilize MBL. Starting from product states, we find that in the MBL regime FAF grows slowly in time, approaching saturation via a power-law relaxation. Overall, our results show that MBL suppresses fermionic non-Gaussianity, and the associated complexity beyond free fermions, while ergodicity restores it, motivating explorations of fermionic non-Gaussianity in other ergodicity-breaking phenomena.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00245v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Predicting the hydrogen bond strength from water reorientation dynamics at short timescales</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00311</link><description>arXiv:2602.00311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Path-integral molecular dynamics simulations and electronic structure-based energy decomposition analysis (EDA) are employed to connect hydrogen bond (H-bond) strength, its asymmetry, and the total delocalization energy at the water/air interface to experimentally measurable observables, such as the reorientation dynamics and the sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectrum. Using SFG spectra for distinct layers at the water/air interface, we validate the accuracy of our simulations and report a red-shift from the interface to bulk and a strongly bonded water peak at around 3250 cm$^{-1}$ in the layer closest to bulk. The reorientation dynamics of water molecules slow down from the interface to bulk, which correlates with the SFG results. From our EDA based on absolutely localized molecular orbitals, we observe a strong decline in total delocalization energy from bulk to the interface, as well as a decline in the strength of the strongest donor and acceptor interactions. The asymmetry between the two strongest interactions similarly rises towards the interface, while the importance of interactions from the outer solvation shells is greatly diminished and is lower than previously reported. Finally, we find that the strength of the strongest H-bond donor/acceptor is best correlated with the local minimum of the autocorrelation function resembling the L2 band librational motions. Following that, we propose a simple yet quantitative relationship between H-bond strength and the short-time reorientation dynamics at the water/air interface that could potentially be extended to predict H-bond strength in other hydrophobic systems from experimentally obtainable observables.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00311v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] General teleparallel geometric theory of defects</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01408</link><description>arXiv:2602.01408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the geometric theory of defects. In the differential-geometric models of defects that have been adopted since the 1950s, dislocations have been associated with torsion, disclinations with the full curvature, and point defects with the first kind trace of non-metricity. The mainstream formulation exhibits several conceptual and technical shortcomings, most notably a hierarchy inconsistency, the non-exictence of a genuine metric formulation, and the potential emergence of Ostrogradsky-type instabilities. These issues have motivated us to develop a new framework, namely a generalized teleparallel geometric theory of defects. In our model, dislocations are identified with the trace of torsion, disclinations with the second kind trace of the non-metricity, and point defects with the first kind trace of the non-metricity. In addition, we retain the scalar part torsion as a free parameter for describing some possible unknown degrees of freedom in the theory of defects. The proposed geometric theory of defects is free from all of the aforementioned drawbacks and is therefore worthy of further investigation. To ensure the coherence and completeness of the discussion, we begin our analysis with elastic deformations, then summarize the existing metric-affine geometric theory of defects, and finally proceed to our original contribution, namely the new theory introduced here. We formulate the entire theory in Eulerian coordinates. Naturally, all results can be reformulated in Lagrangian coordinates as well. All analyses and formulae are expressed in the language of exterior algebra and are carried out in coordinate-independent orthonormal frames.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01408v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Semidefinite programming for understanding limitations of Lindblad equations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01794</link><description>arXiv:2602.01794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lindbladian quantum master equations (LEs) are the most popular descriptions for quantum systems weakly coupled to baths. But, recent works have established that in many situations such Markovian descriptions are fundamentally limited: they cannot simultaneously capture populations and coherences even to the leading-order in system-bath couplings. This can cause violation of fundamental properties like thermalization and continuity equations associated with local conservation laws, even when such properties are expected in the actual setting. This begs the question: given a physical situation, how do we know if there exists an LE that describes it to a desired accuracy? Here we show that, for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium steady states (NESS), this question can be succinctly formulated as a semidefinite program (SDP), a convex optimization technique. If a solution to the SDP can be found to a desired accuracy, then an LE description is possible for the chosen setting. If not, no LE description is fundamentally attainable, showing that a consistent Markovian treatment is impossible even at weak system-bath coupling for that particular setting. Considering few qubit isotropic XXZ-type models coupled to multiple baths, we find that in most parameter regimes, LE description giving accurate populations and coherences to leading-order is unattainable, leading to rigorous no-go results. However, in some cases, LE description having correct populations but inaccurate coherences, and satisfying local conservation laws, is possible over some of the parameter regimes. Our work highlights the power of semidefinite programming in the analysis of physically consistent LEs, thereby, in understanding the limits of Markovian descriptions at weak system-bath couplings.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01794v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Active Screws: Emergent Active Chiral Nematics of Spinning Self-Propelled Rods</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12263</link><description>arXiv:2410.12263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several types of active agents self-propel by spinning around their propulsion axis, thus behaving as active screws. Examples include cytoskeletal filaments in gliding assays, magnetically-driven colloidal helices, and microorganisms like the soil bacterium $\it{M. xanthus}$. Here, we develop a model for spinning self-propelled rods on a substrate, and we coarse-grain it to derive the corresponding hydrodynamic equations. If the rods propel purely along their axis, they form an active nematic at high density and activity. However, spinning rods can also roll sideways as they move. We find that this transverse motion turns the system into a chiral active nematic. Thus, we identify a mechanism whereby individual chirality can give rise to collective chiral flows. Finally, we analyze experiments on $\it{M. xanthus}$ colonies to show that they exhibit chiral flows around topological defects, with a chiral activity about an order of magnitude weaker than the achiral one. Our work reveals the collective behavior of active screws, which is relevant to colonies of social bacteria and groups of unicellular parasites.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.12263v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dominant orbital magnetization in the prototypical altermagnet MnTe</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08675</link><description>arXiv:2505.08675v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnetism is an unconventional form of antiferromagnetism characterized by momentum-dependent spin polarization of electronic states and zero net magnetization, arising from specific crystalline symmetries. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and broken time-reversal symmetry, altermagnets can exhibit finite net magnetization and anomalous Hall effect (AHE), phenomena typically associated with ferromagnets. Due to the dependence of AHE on magnetization, understanding the interplay between spin and orbital contributions to magnetization is essential for interpreting experiments and designing altermagnetic devices. In this work, we use density functional theory to investigate the intrinsic spin and orbital magnetization of the magnetic ground state of the prototypical altermagnet {\alpha}-MnTe. We find that SOC induces weak ferromagnetism through spin canting, accompanied by a slight in-plane rotation of the N\'eel vector. Notably, we identify a significant net orbital magnetization of 0.176 {\mu}B per unit cell oriented along the z-axis, while the spin magnetization in the same direction is much smaller at 0.002 {\mu}B. By varying the chemical potential, we show that the spin magnetization is tunable through hole doping, whereas the orbital magnetization remains robust against carrier density changes. These results highlight the important role of orbital magnetization and establish its relevance for orbital-based phenomena in altermagnets.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.08675v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Integrability from a single conservation law in quantum spin chains</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20713</link><description>arXiv:2508.20713v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for translationally invariant quantum spin chains with finite-range interactions, the existence of a specific conservation law known as the Reshetikhin condition implies the presence of infinitely many local conserved quantities, i.e., integrability. This shows that the entire hierarchy of conservation laws associated with solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation is already encoded in the lowest nontrivial conservation law. Combined with recent rigorous results on nonintegrability, our theorem strongly restricts the possibility of partially integrable systems that admit only a finite but large number of local conserved quantities. Our work establishes a rigorous foundation for the systematic identification of new integrable models and deepens the algebraic understanding of conservation-law structures in quantum spin chains.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.20713v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Emergent ac Effect in Nonreciprocal Coupled Condensates</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23595</link><description>arXiv:2512.23595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report an emergent ac Josephson-like effect arising without external bias, driven by the interplay between nonreciprocity and nonlinearity in coupled condensates. Using a minimal model of three mutually nonreciprocally coupled condensates, we uncover a rich landscape of dynamical phases governed by generalized Josephson equations. This goes beyond the Kuramoto framework owing to inherent nonreciprocity and dynamically evolving effective couplings, leading to static and dynamical ferromagnetic and (anti)vortex states with nontrivial phase winding. Most strikingly, we identify an ac phase characterized by the emergence of two distinct frequencies, which spontaneously break the time-translation symmetry: one associated with the precession of the global U(1) Goldstone mode and the other with a stabilized limit cycle in a five-dimensional phase space. This phase features bias-free autonomous oscillatory currents beyond conventional Josephson dynamics. We further examine how instabilities develop in the ferromagnetic and vortex states, and how they drive transitions into the ac regime. Interestingly, the transition is hysteretic: phases with different winding numbers destabilize under distinct conditions, reflecting their inherently different nonlinear structures. Our work lays the foundation for exploring nonreciprocity-driven novel dynamical phases in a broad class of condensate platforms.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23595v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Two-Level System Microwave Losses in Chemically Pure Bulk Niobium Oxide Samples</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06668</link><description>arXiv:2601.06668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Losses from two-level systems (TLS) associated with amorphous oxides remain one of the primary limitations to the performance of superconducting qubits and microwave cavities. Niobium resonators are widely used in quantum science experiments, yet niobium's natural oxide layer contains various types of oxides whose relative contributions to TLS loss have not been clearly distinguished. Here, we use a superconducting 3D microwave cavity to measure chemically pure oxides \ch{Nb2O5} and \ch{NbO2}. Using this approach, we directly compare the loss characteristics of \ch{Nb2O5} and \ch{NbO2}. Our measurements show that the \ch{Nb2O5} oxide exhibits losses which have the power and temperature behavior expected for TLS. Moreover, the measurements agree with existing theoretical models. Analogous measurements performed on \ch{NbO2} do not show any detectable TLS loss signatures. These results provide direct experimental evidence that \ch{Nb2O5} is the dominant TLS host in niobium resonators and establish a general framework for separating oxide-specific dissipation channels.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06668v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum-geometry-enabled Landau-Zener tunneling in singular flat bands</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20093</link><description>arXiv:2601.20093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flat-band materials have attracted substantial interest for their intriguing quantum geometric effects. Here we investigate how singular flat bands (SFBs) respond to a static, uniform electric field and whether they can support single-particle dc transport. By constructing a minimal two-band lattice model, we show that away from the singular band crossing point (BCP), the Wannier-Stark (WS) spectrum of the flat band is well captured by an intraband Berry phase $\Phi_{\mathrm{B}}$. The associated WS eigenstates are exponentially localized along the field direction, precluding dc transport. In contrast, near the BCP the interband Berry connection becomes prominent and drives Landau-Zener tunneling, which bends the flat-band WS ladder and delocalizes the SFB wavefunctions. Remarkably, this regime is governed solely by the maximal quantum distance $d$ through two geometric phases $(\theta,\varphi)$: $\theta$ characterizes the tunneling rate and $\varphi$ acts as a generalized Berry phase. These results highlight the essential role of quantum geometry in enabling nontrivial transport signatures in SFBs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20093v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The neural networks with tensor weights and emergent fermionic Wick rules in the large-width limit</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05303</link><description>arXiv:2507.05303v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study complex-valued neural network (CVNNs) with tensor-valued hidden-to-output weights within the framework of neural-network quantum field theory (NN-QFT). For standard CVNNs with scalar weights, we derive the generating functional and identify the exact Gaussian process that arises in the infinite-width limit, together with its associated effective quantum state. When the last-layer weights are promoted to Clifford-algebra-valued tensors, the network output becomes complex matrix-valued, and a fermion-like sign structure in the large-width correlation functions of the network output is induced. We show that, in the infinite-width limit, correlators with equal numbers of $f^{\dag}$ and $f$ obey fermionic Wick rules and can be written as determinants built from a scalar Euclidean kernel $S(x,y)=\langle f^{\dag}(x)f(y)\rangle$. This provides a sign-structured extension of NN-QFT at the level of Euclidean correlators and Feynman rules, even though a microscopic Grassmann path integral representation for the network parameters has not yet been constructed. Our analysis thus pushes the NN-QFT correspondence beyond purely bosonic Gaussian fields and suggests a possible route to encoding fermion-like symmetries in neural architectures for QFT correspondence.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.05303v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Advancing Universal Deep Learning for Electronic-Structure Hamiltonian Prediction of Materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19877</link><description>arXiv:2509.19877v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has offered significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT methods, yet the diversity of atomic types, structural patterns, and the high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians pose substantial challenges to the generalization performance. In this work, we contribute on both the methodology and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC, comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.19877v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Semiclassical Canovaccio for Composite Operators</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23539</link><description>arXiv:2512.23539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross

Abstract: Electromigration (EM) induced stress evolution is a major reliability challenge in nanometer-scale VLSI interconnects. Accurate EM analysis requires solving stress-governing partial differential equations over large interconnect trees, which is computationally expensive using conventional finite-difference methods. This work proposes two fast EM stress analysis techniques based on rational Krylov subspace reduction. Unlike traditional Krylov methods that expand around zero frequency, rational Krylov methods enable expansion at selected time constants, aligning directly with metrics such as nucleation and steady-state times and producing compact reduced models with minimal accuracy loss. Two complementary frameworks are developed: a frequency-domain extended rational Krylov method, ExtRaKrylovEM, and a time-domain rational Krylov exponential integration method, EiRaKrylovEM. We show that the accuracy of both methods depends strongly on the choice of expansion point, or shift time, and demonstrate that effective shift times are typically close to times of interest such as nucleation or post-void steady state. Based on this observation, a coordinate descent optimization strategy is introduced to automatically determine optimal reduction orders and shift times for both nucleation and post-void phases. Experimental results on synthesized structures and industry-scale power grids show that the proposed methods achieve orders-of-magnitude improvements in efficiency and accuracy over finite-difference solutions. Using only 4 to 6 Krylov orders, the methods achieve sub-0.1 percent error in nucleation time and resistance change predictions while delivering 20 to 500 times speedup. In contrast, standard extended Krylov methods require more than 50 orders and still incur 10 to 20 percent nucleation time error, limiting their practicality for EM-aware optimization and stochastic EM analysis.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00330v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] AutoGNN: End-to-End Hardware-Driven Graph Preprocessing for Enhanced GNN Performance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00803</link><description>arXiv:2602.00803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural network (GNN) inference faces significant bottlenecks in preprocessing, which often dominate overall inference latency. We introduce AutoGNN, an FPGA-based accelerator designed to address these challenges by leveraging FPGA's reconfigurability and specialized components. AutoGNN adapts to diverse graph inputs, efficiently performing computationally intensive tasks such as graph conversion and sampling. By utilizing components like adder trees, AutoGNN executes reduction operations in constant time, overcoming the limitations of serialization and synchronization on GPUs.
  AutoGNN integrates unified processing elements (UPEs) and single-cycle reducers (SCRs) to streamline GNN preprocessing. UPEs enable scalable parallel processing for edge sorting and unique vertex selection, while SCRs efficiently handle sequential tasks such as pointer array construction and subgraph reindexing. A user-level software framework dynamically profiles graph inputs, determines optimal configurations, and reprograms AutoGNN to handle varying workloads. Implemented on a 7$n$m enterprise FPGA, AutoGNN achieves up to 9.0$\times$ and 2.1$\times$ speedup compared to conventional and GPU-accelerated preprocessing systems, respectively, enabling high-performance GNN preprocessing across diverse datasets.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00803v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] ENFOR-SA: End-to-end Cross-layer Transient Fault Injector for Efficient and Accurate DNN Reliability Assessment on Systolic Arrays</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00909</link><description>arXiv:2602.00909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have produced highly accurate but increasingly large and complex DNNs, making traditional fault-injection techniques impractical. Accurate fault analysis requires RTL-accurate hardware models. However, this significantly slows evaluation compared with software-only approaches, particularly when combined with expensive HDL instrumentation. In this work, we show that such high-overhead methods are unnecessary for systolic array (SA) architectures and propose ENFOR-SA, an end-to-end framework for DNN transient fault analysis on SAs. Our two-step approach employs cross-layer simulation and uses RTL SA components only during fault injection, with the rest executed at the software level. Experiments on CNNs and Vision Transformers demonstrate that ENFOR-SA achieves RTL-accurate fault injection with only 6% average slowdown compared to software-based injection, while delivering at least two orders of magnitude speedup (average $569\times$) over full-SoC RTL simulation and a $2.03\times$ improvement over a state-of-the-art cross-layer RTL injection tool.

Abstract: Domain-specialized FPGAs have delivered unprecedented performance for low-latency inference across scientific and industrial workloads, yet nearly all existing accelerators assume static models trained offline, relegating learning and adaptation to slower CPUs or GPUs. This separation fundamentally limits systems that must operate in non-stationary, high-frequency environments, where model updates must occur at the timescale of the underlying physics. In this paper, I argue for a shift from inference-only accelerators to ultrafast on-chip learning, in which both inference and training execute directly within the FPGA fabric under deterministic, sub-microsecond latency constraints. Bringing learning into the same real-time datapath as inference would enable closed-loop systems that adapt as fast as the physical processes they control, with applications spanning quantum error correction, cryogenic qubit calibration, plasma and fusion control, accelerator tuning, and autonomous scientific experiments. Enabling such regimes requires rethinking algorithms, architectures, and toolflows jointly, but promises to transform FPGAs from static inference engines into real-time learning machines.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02005v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Ultrafast On-chip Online Learning via Spline Locality in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02056</link><description>arXiv:2602.02056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast online learning is essential for high-frequency systems, such as controls for quantum computing and nuclear fusion, where adaptation must occur on sub-microsecond timescales. Meeting these requirements demands low-latency, fixed-precision computation under strict memory constraints, a regime in which conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are both inefficient and numerically unstable. We identify key properties of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) that align with these constraints. Specifically, we show that: (i) KAN updates exploiting B-spline locality are sparse, enabling superior on-chip resource scaling, and (ii) KANs are inherently robust to fixed-point quantization. By implementing fixed-point online training on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), a representative platform for on-chip computation, we demonstrate that KAN-based online learners are significantly more efficient and expressive than MLPs across a range of low-latency and resource-constrained tasks. To our knowledge, this work is the first to demonstrate model-free online learning at sub-microsecond latencies.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02056v1</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Integrated action for skin NTDs: Deconstructing transmission, addressing knowledge gaps, and championing one health strategies</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69065-0</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 03 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69065-0"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-69065-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;This review calls for integrated Skin NTD action, using One Health to analyze complex human, animal, and environmental transmission.

We conducted a PRISMA-based systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized and cohort studies identified by searching PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library through June 2025. Across 25 studies including 41,417 patients, RATS was associated with lower conversion to thoracotomy rates and less blood loss, more extensive lymphadenectomy and higher R0 resection rates, and shorter chest tube duration, ICU stay, and hospital stay.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00273-7?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Shaping Inter-Brain Plasticity: A Feasibility Study of Enhancing Inter-Brain Synchrony with Dyadic Neurofeedback</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00269-5?rss=yes</link><description>Inter-brain synchrony, the co-activation of brain regions between interacting individuals, is increasingly recognized as a key mechanism underlying social connectedness. This study examined whether dyadic neurofeedback training can enhance inter-brain synchrony in the inferior frontal gyrus and causally increase connectedness. We developed a real-time dyadic neurofeedback platform using functional near-infrared spectroscopy, where unacquainted dyads underwent three training sessions receiving either real neurofeedback or sham feedback.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00269-5?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Systematic Profiling of SARS-CoV-2 Structural Protein-Specific T Cell Epitopes in Omicron Infections Following Inactivated Vaccination</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00266-X?rss=yes</link><description>Comprehensive identification of T cell-epitopes is crucial for understanding SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell immunity and guiding vaccine development. Epitope-specific T cell primed by inactivated vaccination (IV)-widely administered in China-followed by Omicron breakthrough infection (BI) remains poorly characterized. Using hierarchical epitope-screening in the IV-BI cohort, we systematically validated known epitope-HLA interactions and uncovered previously unrecognized associations, revealing immunodominant epitopes in conserved regions (S1-NTD, M protein β-sandwich, N-CTD).</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid

Abstract: These are the notes for the 4.5-hour course with the same title that I delivered in August 2025 at the Les Houches summer school ``Exact Solvability and Quantum Information''. In these notes I pedagogically introduce the setting of brickwork quantum circuits and show that it provides a useful framework to study non-equilibrium quantum many-body dynamics in the presence of local interactions. I first show that brickwork quantum circuits evolve quantum correlations in a way that is fundamentally similar to local Hamiltonians, and then present examples of brickwork quantum circuits where, surprisingly, one can compute exactly several relevant dynamical and spectral properties in the presence of non-trivial interactions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22375v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Soliton-to-droplet crossover in a dipolar Bose gas in one and two dimensions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22955</link><description>arXiv:2601.22955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a system of dipolar atoms confined in geometries of quasi-low-dimensionality. Due to the long-range and anisotropic nature of dipolar interactions, the system supports both stable solitons and quantum droplets. In quasi-one-dimensional geometries, the transition between these states is known to manifest either as a first-order phase transition, associated with bistability, or as a smooth crossover. We investigate this transition by calculating the structure factor and showing that the response of the breathing mode provides an experimentally accessible probe. In addition, we identify regions of both bistability and smooth crossover in quasi-two-dimensional geometries. Finally, we connect our findings to previous experimental results and delineate the conditions under which two-dimensional dipolar bright solitons can be realized.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22955v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Magnetic field control of the excitonic transition in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23136</link><description>arXiv:2601.23136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of excitonic insulator phases in quantum materials is often masked by structural distortions caused by the coupling between electronic and phononic order parameters. Here we show that the candidate material Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ is characterized by a metastable excitonic insulating phase that is decoupled from the lattice, and that can be stabilized for sufficiently high applied magnetic fields. By considering the interplay between the excitonic and structural instabilities, we predict a magnetic field induced transition from the low-temperature structurally distorted semiconducting phase to an undistorted excitonic insulator phase with ground state loop currents. Before the transition, the existence of a latent excitonic phase can be detected by the magnetic field softening of the phonon mode associated with the structural distortion. These results highlight an unbiased route towards the disentanglement of the coupled excitonic-structural transition in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$, and uncover a general mechanism for magnetic field control of competing phases in quantum materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23136v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Chitosan/alginate bionanocomposites adorned with mesoporous silica nanoparticles for bone tissue engineering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22192</link><description>arXiv:2601.22192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The regeneration of oral and craniofacial bone defects ranging from minor periodontal and peri-implant defects to large and critical lesions imposes a substantial global health burden. Conventional therapies are associated with several limitations, highlighting the development of a unique treatment strategy, such as tissue engineering. A well-designed scaffold for bone tissue engineering should possess biocompatibility, biodegradability, mechanical strength, and osteoconductivity. For this purpose, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were synthesized and incorporated at different ratios (10, 20, and 30%) into alginate/chitosan (Alg/Chit)-based porous composite scaffolds fabricated through the freeze-drying method. The MSN incorporation significantly improved the mechanical strength of the scaffolds while showing a negligible decreasing effect on the porosity. All of the samples showed desirable swelling behaviors, which is beneficial for cell attachment and proliferation. The MSN-containing scaffolds indicated a decreased hydrolytic degradation in an MSN percentage-dependent manner. The fabricated scaffolds did not depict cytotoxic characteristics. The Alg/Chit/MSN30 scaffolds not only showed noncytotoxic properties, but also increased the cell viability significantly compared to the control group. The biomineralization properties of the MSN-containing nanocomposite scaffolds were significantly higher than the Alg/Chit composite, suggesting the potential of these nanoparticles for bone tissue engineering applications. Taken together, it is concluded that the Alg/Chit/ MSN30 scaffolds are considerable substances for bone tissue regeneration, and MSN has a great tissue engineering potential in addition to its extensive biomedical applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22192v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum bootstrap product codes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22363</link><description>arXiv:2601.22363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Product constructions constitute a powerful method for generating quantum CSS codes, yielding celebrated examples such as toric codes and asymptotically good low-density parity check (LDPC) codes. Since a CSS code is fully described by a chain complex, existing product formalisms are predominantly homological, defined via the tensor product of the underlying chain complexes of input codes, thereby establishing a natural connection between quantum codes and topology. In this Letter, we introduce the \textit{quantum bootstrap product} (QBP), an approach that extends beyond this standard homological paradigm. Specifically, a QBP code is determined by solving a consistency condition termed the ``bootstrap equation''. We find that the QBP paradigm unifies a wide range of important codes, including general hypergraph product (HGP) codes of arbitrary dimensions and fracton codes typically represented by the X-cube code. Crucially, the solutions to the bootstrap equation yield chain complexes where the chain groups and associated boundary maps consist of multiple components. We term such structures \textit{fork complexes}. This structure elucidates the underlying topological structures of fracton codes, akin to foliated fracton order theories. Beyond conceptual insights, we demonstrate that the QBP paradigm can generate self-correcting quantum codes from input codes with constant energy barriers and surpass the code-rate upper bounds inherent to HGP codes. Our work thus substantially extends the scope of quantum product codes and provides a versatile framework for designing fault-tolerant quantum memories.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22363v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Compact U(1) Lattice Gauge Theory in Superconducting Circuits with Infinite-Dimensional Local Hilbert Spaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23150</link><description>arXiv:2601.23150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a superconducting-circuit architecture that realizes a compact U(1) lattice gauge theory using the intrinsic infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of phase and charge variables. The gauge and matter fields are encoded directly in the degrees of freedom of the rotor variables associated with the circuit nodes, and Gauss's law emerges exactly from the conservation of local charge, without auxiliary stabilizers, penalty terms, or Hilbert-space truncation. A minimal gauge-matter coupling arises microscopically from Josephson nonlinearities, whereas the magnetic plaquette interaction is generated perturbatively via virtual matter excitations. Numerical diagonalization confirms the emergence of compact electrodynamics and coherent vortex excitations, underscoring the need for large local Hilbert spaces in the continuum regime. The required circuit parameters are within the current experimental capabilities. Our results establish superconducting circuits as a scalable, continuous-variable platform for analog quantum simulation of non-perturbative gauge dynamics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23150v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Inhibiting Conduction by He Mixing in Interiors of Jupiter and Saturn</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23152</link><description>arXiv:2601.23152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate knowledge of the electrical and thermal conductivities and structural properties of hydrogen-helium mixtures under thermodynamic conditions within and beyond the immiscibility range is very important to predict the thermal evolution and internal structure of gas giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn. Here, we propose a novel method to determine the immiscibility boundary accurately without the need for free energy calculations, while providing consistent insights into structural and transport properties of mixtures. We show with direct large-scale ab initio simulations that the insulator-metal transition (IMT) of the hydrogen subsystem is strongly affected by an admixture with a small fraction of helium and occurs at temperatures significantly higher than those of pure hydrogen. At pressures below 150 GPa, the IMT boundary is not related anymore to the H2 subsystem dissociation, the system remains insulating even after the full dissociation of H2 molecules and its transition to an H-He mixture. The offset of the IMT in the H-He mixture relative to the dissociation region in the hydrogen subsystem and the significant reduction of static electrical and thermal conductivity by a factor between two and a few thousand relative to pure hydrogen found in mixtures have consequences for Jupiter and Saturn's thermal evolution, internal structure, and dynamo action, affecting a large fraction of the interior of both planets.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23152v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Entanglement dynamics from universal low-lying modes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16763</link><description>arXiv:2407.16763v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information-theoretic quantities such as Renyi entropies show a remarkable universality in their late-time behaviour across a variety of chaotic many-body systems. Understanding how such common features emerge from very different microscopic dynamics remains an important challenge. In this work, we address this question in a class of Brownian models with random time-dependent Hamiltonians and a variety of different microscopic couplings. In any such model, the Lorentzian time-evolution of the $n$-th Renyi entropy can be mapped to evolution by a Euclidean Hamiltonian on 2$n$ copies of the system. We provide evidence that in systems with no symmetries, the low-energy excitations of the Euclidean Hamiltonian are universally given by a gapped quasiparticle-like band. The eigenstates in this band are plane waves of locally dressed domain walls between ferromagnetic ground states associated with two permutations in the symmetric group $S_n$. These excitations give rise to the membrane picture of entanglement growth, with the membrane tension determined by their dispersion relation. We establish this structure in a variety of cases using analytical perturbative methods and numerical variational techniques, and extract the associated dispersion relations and membrane tensions for the second and third Renyi entropies. For the third Renyi entropy, we argue that phase transitions in the membrane tension as a function of velocity are needed to ensure that physical constraints on the membrane tension are satisfied. Overall, this structure provides an understanding of entanglement dynamics in terms of a universal set of gapped low-lying modes, which may also apply to systems with time-independent Hamiltonians.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2407.16763v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Effective permeability conditions for diffusive transport through impermeable membranes with gaps</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10694</link><description>arXiv:2508.10694v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Membranes regulate transport in a wide variety of industrial and biological applications. The microscale geometry of the membrane can significantly affect overall transport through the membrane, but the precise nature of this multiscale coupling is not well characterised in general. Motivated by the application of transport across a bacterial membrane, in this paper we use formal multiscale analysis to derive explicit effective coupling conditions for macroscale transport across a two-dimensional impermeable membrane with periodically spaced gaps, and validate these with numerical simulations. We derive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with the membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry. Our results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to a wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrate that if the exterior concentration varies in time, for membranes with long channels, the transport gains a memory property where the coupling conditions depend on the system history. By applying our effective conditions in the context of small molecule transport through gaps in bacterial membranes called porins, we predict that bacterial membrane permeability is primarily dominated by the thickness of the membrane. Furthermore, we predict how alterations to membrane microstructure, for example via changes to porin expression, might affect overall transport, including when external concentrations vary in time. These results will apply to a broad range of physical applications with similar membrane structures, from medical and industrial filtration to carbon capture.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.10694v5</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A finite viscoelastic constitutive model for low to high strain rate response of elastomers with application of strain rate-induced glass transition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05405</link><description>arXiv:2601.05405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amorphous elastomers exhibit significant rate-stiffening and unique viscous flow characteristics across a wide range of strain rates, often undergoing glass transition above a strain rate threshold. We have developed a thermodynamically-consistent and micromechanically-inspired constitutive model for soft elastomeric materials to capture the rate-dependent stress-strain behavior and hysteresis when subjected to low to high strain rates. Our proposed constitutive model encapsulates the viscous flow of materials through molecular motion at low strain rates and local rearrangement and alignment at high strain rates, essentially covering the glass transition. We applied our constitutive model to uniaxial compression experiments performed at low and high strain rates for polyborosiloxane (PBS) to identify the material parameters, and subsequently, performed numerical simulations of single and multi-cycle compression, stress relaxation, and small amplitude oscillatory tension-compression. Our analyses indicate that the model predicts higher total energy dissipation with increasing strain rate; however, dissipation associated with molecular relaxation decreases (forming a cusp) because, beyond a crossover strain rate, molecular rearrangement and alignment become dominant, which is consistent with the onset of the glass transition. For cyclic loading-unloading, we observed that dissipation over a cycle remains constant at low strain rate but decreases non-monotonically at high strain rates before becoming constant with peak stress over the cycle becoming higher, which can be interpreted as more loading being carried elastically by the polymer network as the molecular rearrangement process occurs. Additionally, our model was able to predict the qualitative nature of the storage modulus and loss modulus in the limit of small strain over a wide range of frequency sweeps.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05405v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Floquet-Thermalization via Instantons near Dynamical Freezing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10498</link><description>arXiv:2412.10498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven Floquet quantum many-body systems have revealed new insights into the rich interplay of thermalization, and growth of entanglement. The phenomenology of dynamical freezing, whereby a translationally invariant many-body system exhibits emergent conservation laws and a slow growth of entanglement entropy at certain fixed ratios of a drive amplitude and frequency, presents a novel paradigm for retaining memory of an initial state upto late times. Previous studies of dynamical freezing have largely been restricted to a high-frequency Floquet-Magnus expansion, and numerical exact diagonalization, which are unable to capture the slow approach to thermalization (or lack thereof) in a systematic fashion. By employing Floquet flow-renormalization, where the time-dependent part of the Hamiltonian is gradually decoupled from the effective Hamiltonian using a sequence of unitary transformations, we unveil the universal approach to dynamical freezing and beyond, at asymptotically late times. We analyze the fixed-point behavior associated with the flow-renormalization at and near freezing using both exact-diagonalization and tensor-network based methods, and contrast the results with conventional prethermal phenomenon. For a generic non-integrable spin Hamiltonian with a periodic cosine wave drive, the flow approaches an unstable fixed point with an approximate emergent symmetry. We observe that at freezing the thermalization timescales are delayed compared to away from freezing, and the flow trajectory undergoes a series of instanton events. Our numerical results are supported by analytical solutions to the flow equations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2412.10498v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] RulePlanner: All-in-One Reinforcement Learner for Unifying Design Rules in 3D Floorplanning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22476</link><description>arXiv:2601.22476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floorplanning determines the coordinate and shape of each module in Integrated Circuits. With the scaling of technology nodes, in floorplanning stage especially 3D scenarios with multiple stacked layers, it has become increasingly challenging to adhere to complex hardware design rules. Current methods are only capable of handling specific and limited design rules, while violations of other rules require manual and meticulous adjustment. This leads to labor-intensive and time-consuming post-processing for expert engineers. In this paper, we propose an all-in-one deep reinforcement learning-based approach to tackle these challenges, and design novel representations for real-world IC design rules that have not been addressed by previous approaches. Specifically, the processing of various hardware design rules is unified into a single framework with three key components: 1) novel matrix representations to model the design rules, 2) constraints on the action space to filter out invalid actions that cause rule violations, and 3) quantitative analysis of constraint satisfaction as reward signals. Experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and validity of our approach. Furthermore, transferability is well demonstrated on unseen circuits. Our framework is extensible to accommodate new design rules, thus providing flexibility to address emerging challenges in future chip design.

Abstract: IR-drop is a critical power integrity challenge in modern VLSI designs that can cause timing degradation, reliability issues, and functional failures if not detected early in the design flow. Conventional IR-drop analysis relies on physics-based signoff tools, which provide high accuracy but incur significant computational cost and require near-final layout information, making them unsuitable for rapid early-stage design exploration. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based surrogate modeling approach for early-stage IR-drop estimation using a CNN. The task is formulated as a dense pixel-wise regression problem, where spatial physical layout features are mapped directly to IR-drop heatmaps. A U-Net-based encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections is employed to effectively capture both local and global spatial dependencies within the layout. The model is trained on a physics-inspired synthetic dataset generated by us, which incorporates key physical factors including power grid structure, cell density distribution, and switching activity. Model performance is evaluated using standard regression metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can accurately predict IR-drop distributions with millisecond-level inference time, enabling fast pre-signoff screening and iterative design optimization. The proposed framework is intended as a complementary early-stage analysis tool, providing designers with rapid IR-drop insight prior to expensive signoff analysis.

Abstract: Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) is the most essential component for polynomial multiplications used in lattice-based Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms such as Kyber, Dilithium, NTRU etc. However, side-channel attacks (SCA) and hardware vulnerabilities in the form of hardware Trojans may alter control signals to disrupt the circuit's control flow and introduce unconventional delays in the critical hardware of PQC. Hardware Trojans, especially on control signals, are more low cost and impactful than data signals because a single corrupted control signal can disrupt or bypass entire computation sequences, whereas data faults usually cause only localized errors. On the other hand, adversaries can perform Soft Analytical Side Channel Attacks (SASCA) on the design using the inserted hardware Trojan. In this paper, we present a secure NTT architecture capable of detecting unconventional delays, control-flow disruptions, and SASCA, while providing an adaptive fault-correction methodology for their mitigation. Extensive simulations and implementations of our Secure NTT on Artix-7 FPGA with different Kyber variants show that our fault detection and correction modules can efficiently detect and correct faults whether caused unintentionally or intentionally by hardware Trojans with a high success rate, while introducing only modest area and time overheads.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22804v1</guid></item><item><title>[Nature] Are health influencers making us sick?</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00313-5</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature, Published online: 02 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00313-5"&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-026-00313-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Social media can help to raise awareness of health conditions — but the wealth of dubious information online might do more harm than good.</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00313-5</guid></item><item><title>[Nature] Is this journal legitimate?

This is partially mediated by the Warburg effect, which generates ATP while oxidizing glucose to a subset of these anabolites. Concurrently, mitochondrial mass and ATP generation via oxidative phosphorylation decline in most tumors. This raises the question of how increased glycolysis-derived anabolites can be balanced with those supplied by the TCA cycle. Using primary murine liver cancers and their derivative cell lines, we show that this can be explained by the dissociation of mitochondrial Complex V (CV or ATP synthase) into its component and functionally-independent Fo and F1 domains.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00264-6?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] FDA-approved PDE4 inhibitors alleviate the dominant toxicity of ALS-FTD-associated CHCHD10S59L in Drosophila and human cells.</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00254-3?rss=yes</link><description>Mutations in CHCHD10 are a genetic cause of ALS-FTD. In our previous studies using Drosophila expressing C2C10HS81L and human cells expressing CHCHD10S59L, we found that aberrant activation of the PINK1/Parkin pathway drives cellular toxicity, and pseudo-substrate inhibitors of PINK1 or mitofusin-2 agonists can mitigate these effects. Evidence from in vitro, in vivo, and chemical approaches supports PINK1 inhibition as a promising strategy for CHCHD10S59L-associated disease. Here, we show that FDA-approved PDE4 inhibitors significantly reduce CHCHD10S59L-induced mitochondrial morphological and functional defects in both human cells and Drosophila.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00254-3?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Social stress and affiliative touch: a tale of two affective states</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00208-7?rss=yes</link><description>Social interactions are an integral part in the life of social species. Humans and other species, such as rats and mice, thrive on positive social interactions, whereas stressful social encounters can be among the most negative and traumatizing experiences. These traumatic experiences have often been linked to psychopathology, with some individuals being more vulnerable than others in developing maladaptations. Here we review literature regarding both positive and negative affective states linked with prosocial/affiliative and stressful social experiences respectively.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid

Abstract: Unconventional superconductivity is a desirable state of matter due to its potential for high transition temperatures $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ and associated favorable superconducting properties. However, the sign-changing nature of the order parameter of unconventional superconductors renders their condensates fragile to disorder, an inevitability in real materials. We uncover the generic properties of electronic band structures and associated Bloch weights able to support robust unconventional superconductivity. We demonstrate this property in several case studies of the kagome and Lieb lattices, showing how unconventional superconductors exhibit unusually weak $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ suppression by disorder, despite featuring fully compensated sign-changing order parameters. We contrast these results with those for unconventional superconductivity on the square and honeycomb lattices, which are unable to protect the condensates from disorder. Finally, we discuss material candidates for which this effect may be realized.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20937v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spin-orbit-induced Instability and Finite-Temperature Stabilization of a Triangular-lattice Supersolid</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20963</link><description>arXiv:2601.20963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometrically frustrated triangular-lattice magnets provide fertile ground for realizing intriguing quantum phases such as spin supersolids. A common expectation is that spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which breaks continuous spin rotational symmetry, destabilizes these phases by gapping their low-energy modes. Revisiting this assumption, we map out the SOC-field phase diagram of a frustrated triangular-lattice magnet using spin-wave theory and infinite density-matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) simulations. We find that while infinitesimally weak SOC indeed drives a zero-temperature instability of the supersolid by opening a gap, certain supersolid states remain thermodynamically stable at non-zero temperatures. This reveals a previously unrecognized mechanism in which thermal fluctuations counteract SOC to stabilize supersolidity. The resulting finite-temperature supersolids retain key responses, including a giant magnetocaloric effect, highlighting their potential relevance to real materials. At larger SOC, the system transitions into distinct magnetic orders, including a skyrmion lattice, completing a unified phase diagram.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20963v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Classification of non-Fermi liquids and universal superconducting fluctuations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21047</link><description>arXiv:2601.21047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum critical metals, a plethora of different non-Fermi liquids arises depending on the nature of critical fluctuations coupled to Fermi surfaces. In this paper, we classify non-Fermi liquids that arise from q=0 critical fluctuations and characterize their universal superconducting fluctuations. The essential tool is the projective fixed points, which generalizes the notion of fixed points to fixed trajectories that take into account the incessant running of the Fermi momentum under the renormalization group flow. Based on the topology of bundles of projective fixed points, non-Fermi liquids are first grouped into seven superuniversality classes. Each superuniversality class includes multiple universality classes, which are further classified by the universal pairing interactions and emergent symmetries. Despite the pairing interaction generated by critical fluctuations, some non-Fermi liquids remain stable down to zero temperature due to the incoherence of excitations and the lack of scale invariance caused by Fermi momentum. Depending on the strength and span of the universal pairing interaction in momentum space, the emergent symmetry of non-Fermi liquids may or may not be lower than that of Fermi liquids. In non-Fermi liquids that become superconductors at low temperatures, the universal data of the parent metal determine the lower bound for the superconducting transition temperature and the associated pairing symmetry. In superuniversality classes that contain non-Fermi liquids prone to non-s-wave superconducting instabilities, the critical angular momentum above which pairing instability becomes inevitable is sensitive to the Fermi momentum, and the associated superconducting transition temperature oscillates as a function of the density. We use physical examples, as well as a toy model, to elucidate the universal low-energy physics of all superuniversality classes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21047v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Magnonic Quantum Spin Hall Effect with Chiral Magnon Transport in Bilayer Altermagnets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21172</link><description>arXiv:2601.21172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism has attracted considerable interest, yet its associated spintronic phenomena have so far been largely confined to electronic systems. In this work, we uncover a universal symmetry-based strategy for realizing topological altermagnets with the magnonic quantum spin Hall effect, as evidenced by a nonzero spin Chern number and protected helical edge states. Moreover, we demonstrate that chiral magnon splitting in altermagnets gives rise to an intrinsically anisotropic, momentum-resolved thermal Hall response, sharply contrasting with those in ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, thus offering enhanced flexibility for selective manipulation. As a concrete material realization, first-principles calculations and Heisenberg-DM model analysis reveal that V$_2$WS$_4$ bilayer exhibits $d$-wave altermagnetism, integer spin Chern number with helical magnon edge states, and the nonzero momentum-locked thermal Hall conductivity. Our results establish a direct link between topological magnons and altermagnetism, opening new avenues for dissipationless magnonic devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21172v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Efficient high-harmonic generation in van der Waals ferroelectric NbOI$_2$ crystals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21273</link><description>arXiv:2601.21273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered NbOX$_2$ ($X=\mathrm{Cl,\,Br,\,I}$), a member of the van der Waals ferroelectric family, exhibits intrinsic ferroelectricity and pronounced nonlinear optical responses, making it a promising candidate for integrated nanophotonics applications. While previous studies have emphasized the material's strong second-order nonlinear responses, higher-order nonlinear responses are still mostly unexplored. This work systematically investigates NbOI$_2$ using high harmonic generation (HHG) spectroscopy. Driven by an intense mid-infrared laser field centered at $\sim4~\mu\mathrm{m}$ wavelength, highly anisotropic odd- and even-order harmonics up to the 16th order are generated at a low peak intensity of $0.4~\mathrm{TW\,cm^{-2}}$, extending beyond the material's bandgap. Both bulk and flake forms of NbOI$_2$ display pronounced harmonic emission from the near-infrared to the deep-ultraviolet spectral region, with a notably high overall conversion efficiency compared to other known materials. Polarization-resolved measurements reveal that even-order harmonics remain aligned with the crystal polar axis regardless of the driving-field orientation, whereas odd-order harmonics are dynamically affected. First-principles calculations suggest that the flat valence band associated with Peierls dimerization enhances HHG efficiency through electron correlation. These findings provide fresh perspectives on HHG in van der Waals ferroelectric materials and facilitate the development of compact and tunable quantum light sources.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21273v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Transferable mechanism of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy switching by hole doping in V$X_2$ ($X$=Te, Se, S) monolayers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21322</link><description>arXiv:2601.21322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to tune and switch magnetic anisotropy to a perpendicular orientation is a key challenge for implementing 2D magnets in spintronic devices. H-phase vanadium dichalcogenides V$X_2$ ($X$=Te, Se, S) are promising ferromagnetic semiconductors with large magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE). Recent work has shown that hole doping can switch their easy axis to out-of-plane, though the microscopic origin of this perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) remains unclear. Using density-functional-theory calculations, we demonstrate that the PMA enhancement arises from first-order spin-orbit coupling (SOC) acting on topmost degenerate valence states with nonzero orbital angular momentum projection ($m_l\ne 0$). In this case, the $\hat{L}_z\hat{S}_z$ term dominates for perpendicular magnetization, while in-plane orientations involve only weaker, second-order SOC contributions. The increased valence bandwidth leads to depletion of higher-energy states upon hole doping, stabilizing PMA. From this mechanism, we identify two transferable design principles for enhancing MAE under weak hole doping: (i) orbital degeneracy at the valence-band edge protected by point-group symmetry and (ii) finite SOC in the degenerate manifold. Notably, we identify multiple magnetic semiconductors that meet these criteria and display enhanced MAE under hole doping. Furthermore, we show that band engineering can strategically place these degenerate orbitals at the valence band edge, significantly boosting PMA when hole-doped. We also examine trends in VTe$_2$, VSe$_2$, and VS$_2$ to determine the influence of crystal-field splitting, exchange interaction, and orbital hybridization on the valence band edges. These results provide both a fundamental understanding of PMA switching upon hole doping and a transferable strategy for tuning magnetic anisotropy, essential for designing high-performance spintronic materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21322v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Magnetic texture modulated superconductivity in superconductor/ferromagnet shells of semiconductor nanowires</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22051</link><description>arXiv:2601.22051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a one-dimensional ferromagnet-superconductor nanowire, magnetism can suppress superconductivity except where the Zeeman field is suppressed, for example domain wall superconductivity (DWS) near magnetic domain walls or multi-domain-averaged superconductivity (MDAS) in multi-domain states where the net magnetization over the coherence length averages to nearly zero. Here we study full-shell InAs/EuS/Al nanowires using scanning SQUID magnetometry and transport, and find superconductivity in the Al shell only when the EuS is in a multi-domain state, consistent with both DWS and MDAS, and absent in the saturated single-domain state. Scanning SQUID magnetometry further shows that the EuS magnetic texture is position dependent and reconfigurable by small changes in external magnetic field, including moving a well-defined domain wall at $\approx$5.5 $\mu$m/mT with sub-mT fields, implying that any associated localized superconducting region would likewise be movable. Such magnetic texture controlled superconductivity along a nanowire may be useful for topological qubits, Andreev spin qubits, superconducting logic, and memory devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22051v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Double-Bracket Master Equations: Phase-Space Representation and Classical Limit</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20925</link><description>arXiv:2601.20925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the classical limit of quantum master equations featuring double-bracket dissipators. Specifically, we consider dissipators defined by double commutators, which describe dephasing dynamics, as well as dissipators involving double anticommutators, associated with fluctuating anti-Hermitian Hamiltonians. The classical limit is obtained by formulating the open quantum dynamics in phase space using the Wigner function and Moyal products, followed by a systematic $\hbar$-expansion. We begin with the well-known model of energy dephasing, associated with energy diffusion. We then turn to master equations containing a double anticommutator with the system Hamiltonian, recently derived in the context of noisy non-Hermitian systems. For both classes of double-bracket equations, we provide a gradient-flow representation of the dynamics. We analyze the classical limit of the resulting evolutions for harmonic and driven anharmonic quantum oscillators, considering both classical and nonclassical initial states. The dynamics is characterized through the evolution of several observables as well as the Wigner logarithmic negativity. We conclude by extending our analysis to generalized master equations involving higher-order nested brackets, which provide a time-continuous description of spectral filtering techniques commonly used in the numerical analysis of quantum systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20925v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Universal Topological Gates from Braiding and Fusing Anyons on Quantum Hardware</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20956</link><description>arXiv:2601.20956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological quantum computation encodes quantum information in the internal fusion space of non-Abelian anyonic quasiparticles, whose braiding implements logical gates. This goes beyond Abelian topological order (TO) such as the toric code, as its anyons lack internal structure. However, the simplest non-Abelian generalizations of the toric code do not support universality via braiding alone. Here we demonstrate that such minimally non-Abelian TOs can be made universal by treating anyon fusion as a computational primitive. We prepare a 54-qubit TO wavefunction associated with the smallest non-Abelian group, $S_3$, on Quantinuum's H2 quantum processor. This phase of matter exhibits cyclic anyon fusion rules, known to underpin universality, which we evidence by trapping a single non-Abelian anyon on the torus. We encode logical qutrits in the nonlocal fusion space of non-Abelian fluxes and, by combining an entangling braiding operation with anyon charge measurements, realize a universal topological gate set and read-out, which we further demonstrate by topologically preparing a magic state. This work establishes $S_3$ TO as simple enough to be prepared efficiently, yet rich enough to enable universal topological quantum computation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20956v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Building Holographic Entanglement by Measurement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21065</link><description>arXiv:2601.21065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for preparing quantum states with a holographic entanglement structure, in the sense that the entanglement entropies are governed by minimal surfaces in a chosen bulk geometry. We refer to such entropies as holographic because they obey a relation between entropies and bulk minimal surfaces, known as the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, that is a key feature of holographic models of quantum gravity. Typically in such models, the bulk geometry is determined by solving Einstein's equations. Here, we simply choose a bulk geometry, then discretize the geometry into a coupling graph comprising bulk and boundary nodes. Evolving under this graph of interactions and measuring the bulk nodes leaves behind the desired pure state on the boundary. We numerically demonstrate that the resulting entanglement properties approximately reproduce the predictions of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula in the chosen bulk geometry. We consider graphs associated with hyperbolic disk and wormhole geometries, but the approach is general. The minimal ingredients in our proposal involve only Gaussian operations and measurements and are readily implementable in photonic and cold-atom platforms.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21065v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Defect Relative Entropy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21875</link><description>arXiv:2601.21875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of \textit{defect relative entropy} as a measure of distinguishability within the space of defects. We compute the defect relative entropy for conformal/topological defects, deriving a universal formula in conformal field theories (CFTs) on a circle. This formula reduces to the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Furthermore, we provide a detailed expression of the defect relative entropy for diagonal CFTs with specific topological defect choices, utilizing the theory's modular $\mathcal{S}$ matrix. We also present a general formula for the \textit{ defect sandwiched R\'enyi relative entropy} and the \textit{defect fidelity}. Through explicit calculations in specific models, including the Ising model, the tricritical Ising model, and the $\widehat{su}(2)_{k}$ WZW model, we have made an intriguing finding: zero defect relative entropy between reduced density matrices associated with certain topological defect. Notably, we introduce the concept of the \textit{defect relative sector}, representing the set of topological defects with zero defect relative entropy.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21875v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Real-Space Switching of Local Moments Driven by Quantum Geometry in Correlated Graphene Heterostructures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03700</link><description>arXiv:2503.03700v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphene-based multilayer systems serve as versatile platforms for exploring the interplay between electron correlation and topology, thanks to distinctive low-energy bands marked by significant quantum metric and Berry curvature from graphene's Dirac bands. Here, we investigate Mott physics and local spin moments in Dirac bands hybridized with a flat band of localized orbitals in functionalized graphene. Via hybridization control, a topological transition is realized between two symmetry-distinct site-selective Mott states featuring local moments in different Wyckoff positions, with a geometrically enforced metallic state emerging in between. We find that this geometrically controlled real-space switching of local moments and associated metal-insulator physics may be realized through proximity coupling of epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) with group IV intercalants, where the Mott state faces geometrical obstruction in the large-hybridization limit. Our work shows that chemically functionalized graphene provides a correlated electron platform, very similar to the topological heavy fermions in graphene moir\'e systems but at significantly enhanced characteristic energy scales.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.03700v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Anomalous lattice anharmonicity and spin-lattice coupling in spin orbit coupled halide K2IrBr6</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08204</link><description>arXiv:2503.08204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between lattice distortions, magnetism, and spin-orbit coupling in 5d transition-metal halides offers a fertile platform for exploring correlated spin-lattice dynamics. Here, we investigate the impact of structural symmetry breaking on lattice vibrations and local spin environments in the antifluorite compound K2IrBr6 using temperature dependent Raman spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and first-principles lattice dynamics calculations. K2IrBr6 undergoes successive cubic-to-tetragonal and tetragonal-to-monoclinic phase transitions at 170 K and 122 K, respectively, driven by cooperative distortions of the IrBr6 octahedra. Raman spectroscopy reveals anomalous phonon linewidth broadening and unconventional temperature dependence of phonon energies near these transitions, indicating that dynamic spin-phonon coupling is significant well above the Neel temperature (16 K). First-principles phonon calculations support the mode assignments and demonstrate that symmetry-lowering distortions significantly renormalize vibrational modes, consistent with the experimental observations. Complementary EPR measurements detect anisotropic g-factors, resonance field shifts, and linewidth narrowing across the structural transitions, reflecting the emergence of static spin-lattice correlations mediated by spin-orbit entanglement. These findings establish K2IrBr6 as a model system where halide ligand fields, octahedral distortions, and SOC collaboratively govern spin-lattice coupling, providing chemical pathways to engineer quantum materials with tunable magnetic and lattice responses.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.08204v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Gaplessness from disorder and quantum geometry in gapped superconductors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15891</link><description>arXiv:2505.15891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that disorder can induce low-energy Andreev bound states in a sign-changing, but fully gapped, superconductor at $\pi-$junctions. Generically, these excitations are localized. Starting from a superconductor with a sign-changing and nodeless order parameter in the clean limit, here we demonstrate a mechanism for increasing the localization length associated with the low-energy Andreev bound states at a fixed disorder strength. We find that the Fubini-Study metric associated with the electronic Bloch wavefunctions controls the localization length and the hybridization between bound states localized at distinct $\pi-$junctions. We present results for the inverse participation ratio, superfluid stiffness, site-resolved and disorder-averaged spectral functions as a function of increasing Fubini-Study metric, which indicate an increased tendency towards delocalization. The low-energy properties resemble those of a dirty nodal superconductor with gapless Bogoliubov excitations. We place these results in the context of recent experiments in moire graphene superconductors.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.15891v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Chern insulators in two and three dimensions: A global perspective</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04466</link><description>arXiv:2506.04466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a second-quantized field theory for Chern insulators in which the Hamiltonian features a static vector potential that has the periodicity of the crystal's lattice and spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry in the system's ground state. Such a vector potential generates a magnetic field at the microscopic level that may be thought of as arising from local moments associated with one or more magnetic ions in each unit cell. Considering spinor electrons, we study the Chern invariants characterizing the topology of the occupied valence bands of Chern insulators in both two and three dimensions - the Chern number and the Chern vector, respectively - and we derive novel expressions for these topological invariants that are globally defined across the Brillouin zone and involve the full band structure of the system. We also study the long-wavelength response of a Chern insulator to electromagnetic fields at finite frequency, generalizing the quantum anomalous Hall effect in the static limit to the optical regime.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.04466v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Shape-specific fluctuations of an active colloidal interface</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08567</link><description>arXiv:2509.08567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by a recently synthesizable class of active interfaces formed by linked self--propelled colloids, we investigate the dynamics and fluctuations of a phoretically (chemically) interacting active interface with roto--translational coupling. We enumerate all steady--state shapes of the interface across parameter space and identify a regime where the interface acquires a finite curvature, leading to a characteristic ''C--shaped'' topology, along with persistent self--propulsion. In this phase, the interface height fluctuations obey Family--Vicsek scaling but with novel exponents: a dynamic exponent $z_h \approx 0.5$, a roughness exponent $\alpha_h \approx 0.9$ and a super--ballistic growth exponent $\beta_h \approx 1.7$. In contrast, the orientational fluctuations of the colloidal monomers exhibit a negative roughness exponent, reflecting a surprising smoothness law, where steady--state fluctuations diminish with increasing system size. Together, these findings point towards a unique non--equilibrium universality class associated with self--propelled interfaces of non--standard shape.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.08567v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Novel Transformations of PbTiO3 with Pressure and Temperature</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05756</link><description>arXiv:2511.05756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated the behavior of lead titanate (PbTiO3) up to 100 GPa, both at room temperature and upon laser heating, using synchrotron X ray diffraction combined with density functional theory (DFT) computations. At the high pressure temperature (PT) conditions produced in laser heated diamond anvil cells, PbTiO3 dissociates into PbO and TiO2, consistent with our DFT computations showing that decomposition becomes enthalpically favored above 65 GPa. In contrast, on room temperature compression, PbTiO3 persists in the tetragonal I4mcm phase up to at least 100 GPa. Laser heating produces distinct PbO phases: a compressed form of alpha PbO and a previously unreported delta PbO polymorph, both of which transform to beta PbO on decompression. The calculations predict that alpha PbO undergoes pressure-induced band gap closure, metallizing above 70 GPa, whereas the delta and beta phases remain semiconducting with a band gap above 1 eV even at megabar pressures. The experimental and confirming theoretical results reveal an unanticipated dimension of the behavior of PbTiO3, showing that distinct equilibrium and metastable phases can be stabilized along different PT synthesis paths.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.05756v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Tunneling in multi-site mesoscopic quantum Hall circuits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12933</link><description>arXiv:2511.12933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transport properties of single- and two-site mesoscopic quantum Hall (QH) circuits at high transparencies can be described in terms of the lowest-order backscattering processes, enabling a mapping to the boundary sine-Gordon model. We show that this description breaks down in circuits with four or more sites, where higher-order backscattering processes become relevant and qualitatively modify the low-energy physics, while remaining exactly marginal in three-site geometries. Focusing on the four-site circuit, we derive an effective low-energy theory that captures the resulting interaction-driven physics and reveal the emergence of unique quantum-critical points. In the vicinity of these critical points, we obtain universal conductance and scaling behavior and establish the robustness of the associated non-Fermi liquid physics. We further introduce tunneling in multichannel multi-site QH circuits and propose a promising route for realizing diverse quantum-critical phenomena. We show that a boundary sine-Gordon description can be restored in multichannel multi-site QH circuits by appropriately looping selected edge channels, a procedure that is experimentally feasible. Finally, we analyze the non-equilibrium heating effects relevant to transport measurements in QH circuits. Altogether, our results establish multi-site QH circuits as a versatile and highly controllable platform for simulating interaction-driven quantum critical phenomena.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.12933v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Collapse of the superconducting order parameter in Ising superconductors with Rashba spin-orbit coupling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01910</link><description>arXiv:2512.01910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ising superconductors have attracted quite some attention recently, due to their resilience against magnetic fields way beyond the Pauli-paramagnetic limit. Their protection against external magnetic field relies on strong Ising spin-orbit coupling, which originates from in-plane inversion symmetry breaking. Due to the heavy atom nature of Ising SCs, a smaller but sizable Rashba SOC could be present through gating or interfacial effects. Here, we consider the effect of Rashba SOC in a two valley model of Ising superconductors with an attractive $s$-wave interaction. We show that Rashba SOC gives a critical magnetic field, above which the superconducting order parameter collapses at low temperatures. This effect, however, disappears at high temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that the low- and high temperature physics of Ising SCs is quantitatively and qualitatively different in our two-valley model, and may lead to new ways to determine the strength of the Rashba SOC in Ising SCs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.01910v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] CO on a Rh/Fe3O4 single-atom catalyst: high-resolution infrared spectroscopy and near-ambient-pressure scanning tunnelling microscopy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15194</link><description>arXiv:2512.15194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) offers a powerful route to bridging the materials and pressure gaps between surface science and powder catalysis. Using a newly developed IRAS setup optimised for dielectric single crystals, we investigate CO adsorption on the model single-atom catalyst Rh/Fe3O4(001). IRAS resolves three species: monocarbonyls at isolated, twofold-coordinated Rh adatoms, monocarbonyls at fivefold-coordinated Rh atoms embedded in the surface, and gem-dicarbonyls at isolated, twofold-coordinated Rh adatoms. Under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions, RhCO monocarbonyl species at adatom sites dominate. Rh(CO)2 gem-dicarbonyl formation is kinetically hindered and occurs predominantly through CO-induced dissociation of Rh dimers rather than sequential adsorption of two CO molecules at an isolated, twofold Rh adatom. The sequential-adsorption pathway to Rh(CO)2 becomes accessible at millibar CO pressures as evidenced by near-ambient-pressure scanning tunnelling microscopy (NAP-STM). These findings link the UHV behaviour to that expected under realistic reaction conditions. Assignments of the vibrational frequencies to individual species rely on isotopic labelling, thermal treatments, and a review of previous SPM, XPS, and TPD data, supported by density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations. While theory provides qualitative insight, such as the instability of dicarbonyls on fivefold-coordinated Rh atoms, it does not yet reproduce experimental frequencies quantitatively and is sensitive to the computational parameters, highlighting the need for robust experimental benchmarks. The spectroscopic fingerprints established here provide a reliable foundation for identifying Rh coordination environments in oxide-supported single-atom catalysts.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.15194v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The neural networks with tensor weights and emergent fermionic Wick rules in the large-width limit</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05303</link><description>arXiv:2507.05303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study complex-valued neural network (CVNNs) with tensor-valued hidden-to-output weights within the framework of neural-network quantum field theory (NN-QFT). For standard CVNNs with scalar weights, we derive the generating functional and identify the exact Gaussian process that arises in the infinite-width limit, together with its associated effective quantum state. When the last-layer weights are promoted to Clifford-algebra-valued tensors, the network output becomes complex matrix-valued, and a fermion-like sign structure in the large-width correlation functions of the network output is induced. We show that, in the infinite-width limit, correlators with equal numbers of $f^{\dag}$ and $f$ obey fermionic Wick rules and can be written as determinants built from a scalar Euclidean kernel $S(x,y)=\langle f^{\dag}(x)f(y)\rangle$. This provides a sign-structured extension of NN-QFT at the level of Euclidean correlators and Feynman rules, even though a microscopic Grassmann path integral representation for the network parameters has not yet been constructed. Our analysis thus pushes the NN-QFT correspondence beyond purely bosonic Gaussian fields and suggests a possible route to encoding fermion-like symmetries in neural architectures for QFT correspondence.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.05303v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Anyonic membranes and Pontryagin statistics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14314</link><description>arXiv:2509.14314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anyons, unique to two spatial dimensions, underlie extraordinary phenomena such as the fractional quantum Hall effect, but their generalization to higher dimensions has remained elusive. The topology of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces constrains the loop statistics to be only bosonic or fermionic in any dimension. In this work, we introduce the novel anyonic statistics for membrane excitations in four dimensions. Analogous to the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-particle exhibiting $\mathbb{Z}_{N\times \gcd(2,N)}$ anyonic statistics in two dimensions, we show that the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-membrane possesses $\mathbb{Z}_{N\times \gcd(3,N)}$ anyonic statistics in four dimensions. Given unitary volume operators that create membrane excitations on the boundary, we propose an explicit 56-step unitary sequence that detects the membrane statistics. We further analyze the boundary theory of $(5{+}1)$D 1-form $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry-protected topological phases and demonstrate that their domain walls realize all possible anyonic membrane statistics. We then show that the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ subgroup persists in all higher dimensions. In addition to the standard fermionic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ membrane statistics arising from Stiefel-Whitney classes, membranes also exhibit $\mathbb{Z}_3$ statistics associated with Pontryagin classes. We explicitly verify that the 56-step process detects the nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_3$ statistics in 5, 6, and 7 spatial dimensions. Moreover, in 7 and higher dimensions, the statistics of membrane excitations stabilize to $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{3}$, with the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ sector consistently captured by this process.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.14314v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] FireFly-P: FPGA-Accelerated Spiking Neural Network Plasticity for Robust Adaptive Control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21222</link><description>arXiv:2601.21222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically plausible learning mechanism through synaptic plasticity, enabling unsupervised adaptation without the computational overhead of backpropagation. To harness this capability for robotics, this paper presents FireFly-P, an FPGA-based hardware accelerator that implements a novel plasticity algorithm for real-time adaptive control. By leveraging on-chip plasticity, our architecture enhances the network's generalization, ensuring robust performance in dynamic and unstructured environments. The hardware design achieves an end-to-end latency of just 8~$\mu$s for both inference and plasticity updates, enabling rapid adaptation to unseen scenarios. Implemented on a tiny Cmod A7-35T FPGA, FireFly-P consumes only 0.713~W and $\sim$10K~LUTs, making it ideal for power- and resource-constrained embedded robotic platforms. This work demonstrates that hardware-accelerated SNN plasticity is a viable path toward enabling adaptive, low-latency, and energy-efficient control systems.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21222v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] FireFly-S: Exploiting Dual-Side Sparsity for Spiking Neural Networks Acceleration with Reconfigurable Spatial Architecture</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15578</link><description>arXiv:2408.15578v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with brain-inspired structure using discrete spikes instead of continuous activations, are gaining attention for their efficient processing on neuromorphic chips. While current SNN hardware accelerators often prioritize temporal spike sparsity, exploiting sparse synaptic weights offers significant untapped potential for even greater efficiency. To address this, we propose FireFly-S, a Sparse extension of the FireFly series. This co-optimized software-hardware design focuses on leveraging dual-side sparsity for acceleration. On the software side, we propose a algorithmic optimization framework that combines gradient rewiring for pruning and modified Learned Step Size Quantization (LSQ) for SNNs, achieving a weight sparsity exceeding 85\% and enabling efficient 4-bit quantization with negligible accuracy loss. On the hardware side, we present an efficient dual-side sparsity detector employing a Bitmap-based sparse decoding logic to pinpoint the positions of non-zero weights and input spikes. The logic allows for direct bypassing of redundant computations, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. Different from the overlay architecture adopted by previous FireFly series, we adopt a parametric spatial architecture with inter-layer pipelining that can fully exploit the fine-grained programmability and reconfigurability of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), enabling fast deployment for various models. A spatial-temporal dataflow is also proposed to support such inter-layer pipelining and avoid long-term temporal dependencies. In experiments conducted on the MNIST, DVS-Gesture and CIFAR-10 datasets, the FireFly-S model achieves 85--95\% sparsity with 4-bit quantization and the hardware accelerator effectively leverages the dual-side sparsity, delivering performance metrics of 10,047~FPS/W on MNIST, 3,683~FPS/W on DVS-Gesture, and 2,327~FPS/W on CIFAR-10.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2408.15578v3</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Clonal expansion of cytotoxic CD8⁺ T cells in lecanemab-associated ARIA</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68921-3</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 30 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68921-3"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-68921-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Johnson et al. link ARIA, a complication of anti-amyloid therapy, to clonal expansion of cytotoxic CD8 + T cells with glycolytic reprogramming and vascular trafficking potential, with implications for biomarker development and risk mitigation.</description><author>Nature Communications</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68921-3</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Cancer cachexia in &lt;i&gt;STK11/LKB1&lt;/i&gt;-mutated non-small cell lung cancer is dependent on tumor-secreted GDF15</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68702-y</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 30 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68702-y"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-68702-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;GDF15 has been associated with cancer-associated cachexia.

Abstract: Flat-band materials have attracted substantial interest for their intriguing quantum geometric effects. Here we investigate how singular flat bands (SFBs) respond to a static, uniform electric field and whether they can support single-particle dc transport. By constructing a minimal two-band lattice model, we show that away from the singular band crossing point (BCP), the Wannier-Stark (WS) spectrum of the flat band is well captured by an intraband Berry phase $\Phi_{\mathrm{B}}$. The associated WS eigenstates are exponentially localized along the field direction, precluding dc transport. In contrast, near the BCP the interband Berry connection becomes prominent and drives Landau-Zener tunneling, which bends the flat-band WS ladder and delocalizes the SFB wavefunctions. Remarkably, this regime is governed solely by the maximal quantum distance $d$ through two geometric phases $(\theta,\varphi)$: $\theta$ characterizes the tunneling rate and $\varphi$ acts as a generalized Berry phase. These results highlight the essential role of quantum geometry in enabling nontrivial transport signatures in SFBs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20093v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Contrasting impurity-induced magnetism and dynamics in 2H-MoTe2</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20444</link><description>arXiv:2601.20444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of interstitial $^8$Li$^+$ implanted near the surface of 2H-MoTe$_2$ using $\beta$-detected NMR. We find that, unlike the muon, $^8$Li$^+$ does not show any signature of induced magnetism. This result is consistent with density functional theory, which identifies the Li stopping site at the 2a Wyckoff position in the van der Waals gap and confirms the absence of detectable Li-induced electronic spin polarization. Both the spin-lattice relaxation and the resonance lines show evidence of strong spin dynamics above $\sim 200$ K, reminiscent of local stochastic $^8$Li$^+$ motion within a cage. The resonance line shape consists of quadrupolar satellites on top of a broad central peak. To better understand the interaction of $^8$Li$^+$ with the host material, we employ a frequency-comb measurement, by simultaneously exciting four frequencies corresponding to the first-order quadrupolar satellite transitions, $\nu_0 \pm 3\nu_{\mathrm{comb}}$ and $\nu_0 \pm\nu_{\mathrm{comb}}$ around the Larmor frequency $\nu_0$ as a function of $\nu_{\mathrm{comb}}$. This offers an enhanced sensitivity to the quadrupolar split portion of the line. Using this method, we find a small decrease of the quadrupolar frequency with increasing temperature, showing the typical behavior associated with thermally excited phonons and the absence of any magnetic response which was observed with other defects in 2H-MoTe$_2$.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20444v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spin-orbit coupling and beyond in Chiral-Induced Spin Selectivity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20475</link><description>arXiv:2601.20475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral-Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS) describes the emergence of spin-polarized electron transport in chiral systems without magnetic fields, a remarkable effect in light-element materials with weak intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC). This mini-review analyzes the microscopic origins of CISS, highlighting how molecular chirality, local electric fields, and dynamic distortions enhance effective SOC and drive spin-dependent transport. We critically assess existing models in terms of their symmetry constraints, phenomenological assumptions, and compliance with Onsager reciprocity. Recent developments combining relativistic quantum mechanics and complete multipole representations reveal a direct link between chirality density and spin current pseudoscalars, suggesting a field-theoretic foundation for CISS. These insights could help position light-element chiral nanomaterials as tunable platforms for probing and engineering spin-selective phenomena at the nanoscale.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20475v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Ion-Modulated Polyelectrolyte Complexation of DNA and Polyacrylic Acid from Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20541</link><description>arXiv:2601.20541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of complexes between like-charged polyelectrolytes challenges conventional electrostatic intuition and highlights the central role of ions in mediating macromolecular organization. Here, we investigate the salt-dependent association of DNA with poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations in NaCl, MgCl$_2$, and CaCl$_2$ solutions. A time-resolved state classification scheme, based on heavy-atom distance and hydrogen-bond formation, was applied to distinguish bound and unbound configurations, enabling quantitative analysis of how ion valency modulates complex stability and structure. The results reveal a clear hierarchy of association strength with Ca$^{2+}$ promoting persistent complex formation through direct inner-sphere coordination between DNA phosphates and PAA carboxylates, Mg$^{2+}$ mediating weaker, transient bridging interactions and Na$^+$ exhibiting only electrostatic screening action with negligible bridge formation. Structural analysis shows that multivalent ions not only enhance complex stability but also reshape the molecular organization of both macromolecules. Ca$^{2+}$ induces expansion of DNA and compaction of PAA within a strongly bridged complex characterized by directional alignment and backbone-dominated binding, whereas Mg$^{2+}$ promotes more transient groove associations and Na$^+$ supports flexible, weakly correlated contacts. Our findings provide molecular-level insight into ion-specific mechanisms underlying polyelectrolyte organization and inform the design of responsive biomaterials and nucleic acid-based assemblies in multivalent ionic environments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20541v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A Purely Magnetic Route to High-Harmonic Spin Pumping</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20777</link><description>arXiv:2601.20777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin pumping provides a fundamental route for dynamical spin transport, yet in its conventional form it produces only linear spin responses at the driving frequency. Recent studies have shown that spin-orbit coupling (SOC) can lift these restrictions and enable highly nonlinear spin and charge currents. Here we propose a distinct mechanism for high-harmonic spin pumping that does not rely on spin-orbit interactions. We show that nonlinearities in the adiabatic energy spectrum--rather than SOC itself--constitute the essential ingredient for high-harmonic generation in pumped spin currents. Such nonlinearities can arise in purely magnetic systems when a secondary magnetic order parameter is introduced perpendicular to the cone axis of a precessing magnetic moment. As a result, spin pumping and its higher harmonics emerge even in the complete absence of SOC.

However, the growing availability of hardware accelerators such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) has made low-precision formats attractive due to their superior performance, reduced memory footprint, and improved energy efficiency. In this work, we investigate the role of mixed-precision arithmetic in neural-network based Variational Monte Carlo (VMC), a widely used method for solving computationally otherwise intractable quantum many-body systems. We first derive general analytical bounds on the error introduced by reduced precision on Metropolis-Hastings MCMC, and then empirically validate these bounds on the use-case of VMC. We demonstrate that significant portions of the algorithm, in particular, sampling the quantum state, can be executed in half precision without loss of accuracy. More broadly, this work provides a theoretical framework to assess the applicability of mixed-precision arithmetic in machine-learning approaches that rely on MCMC sampling. In the context of VMC, we additionally demonstrate the practical effectiveness of mixed-precision strategies, enabling more scalable and energy-efficient simulations of quantum many-body systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20782v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Seven Etudes on dynamical Keldysh Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06609</link><description>arXiv:2206.06609v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive pedagogical discussion of a family of models describing the propagation of a single particle in a multicomponent non-Markovian Gaussian random field. We report some exact results for single-particle Green's functions, self-energy, vertex part and T-matrix. These results are based on a closed form solution of the Dyson equation combined with the Ward identity. Analytical properties of the solution are discussed. Further we describe the combinatorics of the Feynman diagrams for the Green's function and the skeleton diagrams for the self-energy and vertex, using recurrence relations between the Taylor expansion coefficients of the self-energy. Asymptotically exact equations for the number of skeleton diagrams in the limit of large N are derived. Finally, we consider possible realizations of a multicomponent Gaussian random potential in quantum transport via complex quantum dot experiments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2206.06609v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Observation of emergent scaling of spin-charge correlations at the onset of the pseudogap</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17801</link><description>arXiv:2412.17801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In strongly correlated materials, interacting electrons are entangled and form collective quantum states, resulting in rich low-temperature phase diagrams. Notable examples include cuprate superconductors, in which superconductivity emerges at low doping out of an unusual "pseudogap" metallic state above the critical temperature. The Fermi-Hubbard model, describing a wide range of phenomena associated with strong electron correlations, still offers major computational challenges despite its simple formulation. In this context, ultracold atoms quantum simulators have provided invaluable insights into the microscopic nature of correlated quantum states. Here, we use a quantum gas microscope Fermi-Hubbard simulator to explore a wide range of dopings and temperatures in a regime where a pseudogap is known to develop. By measuring multi-point correlation functions up to fifth order, we uncover a novel universal scaling behaviour in magnetic and higher-order spin-charge correlations characterised by a doping-dependent temperature scale. Accurate comparisons with determinant Quantum Monte Carlo and Minimally Entangled Typical Thermal States simulations confirm that this temperature scale is comparable to the pseudogap temperature T*. Our quantitative findings reveal a novel qualitative behaviour of magnetic properties and spin-charge correlations in an emergent pseudogap and pave the way towards the exploration of charge pairing and collective phenomena expected at lower temperatures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2412.17801v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Active-Absorbing Phase Transitions in the Parallel Minority Game</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22826</link><description>arXiv:2512.22826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Parallel Minority Game (PMG) is a synchronous adaptive multi-agent model that exhibits active-absorbing transitions characteristic of non-equilibrium statistical systems. We perform a comprehensive numerical study of the PMG under two families of microscopic decision rules: (i) agents update their choices based on instantaneous population in their alternative choices, and (ii) threshold-based activation that activates agents movement only after overcrowding density crossing a threshold. We measure time-dependent and steady state limits of activity $A(t)$, overcrowding fraction $F(t)$ as functions of the control parameter $g=N/D$, where $N$ is the number of agents and $D$ is the total number of sites. Instantaneous rules display mean-field directed-percolation (MF-DP) scaling with $\beta\approx1.00$, $\delta\approx0.5$, and $\nu_{\parallel}\approx2.0$. Threshold rules, however, produce a distinct non-mean-field universality class with $\beta\approx0.75$ and a systematic failure of dynamical scaling. We show that thresholding acts as a relevant perturbation to the critical behavior of the model. The results highlight how minimal cognitive features at the agent level fundamentally alter large-scale critical behavior in socio-economic and active systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22826v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Gap solitons of the Wannier and Bloch types in spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates with a moir\'{e} lattice</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09242</link><description>arXiv:2601.09242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gap solitons (GSs) bifurcating from flat bands, which may be represented in terms of Wannier functions, have garnered significant interest due to their strong localization with extremely small norms. Moir\'{e} lattices (MLs), with multiple flat bands, offer an appropriate platform for creating such solitons. We explore the formation mechanism and stability of GSs in spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates under the combined action of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and an ML potential. We identify five Wannier-type GS families bifurcating from the lowest five energy bands in the spectrum induced by the ML with sufficiently large period and depth. These fundamental GSs serve as basic elements for constructing more complex Wannier-type GS states. Reducing the lattice period and depth triggers a transition from the Wannier-type GSs to ones of the Bloch type, the latter exhibiting higher norm thresholds and pronounced spatial broadening near edges of the energy bands. In addition to tuning the lattice-potential parameters, adjusting the SOC strength can also modulate the flatness of energy bands and enhance the localization of gap solitons, enabling reversible transitions between the GSs of the Wannier and Bloch types. Distinctive properties of GSs in the quasiperiodic ML are uncovered too. Thus, we propose the theoretical foundation for the creation of and manipulations with strongly localized GSs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09242v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Materials design based on a material-motif network and heterogeneous graphs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17170</link><description>arXiv:2601.17170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning models for functional materials design require precise and informative representations of material systems. Common representations encode atomic composition and bonding but often do not include local coordination environments across chemically diverse crystals. Recurring structural motifs provide a motif level description of crystalline solids and can serve as interpretable descriptors for structure property learning. To analyze the motif connectivity in materials, we construct a bipartite material motif network from 131,548 Materials Project entries, with materials and motifs as the two node sets. Edges connect materials to their constituent motifs and are weighted by motif distortion, which quantifies the strength of each material motif association. Network connectivity is analyzed to identify motif-defined material clusters that capture recurring local geometries relevant to structure property trends. Most shared motifs act as hubs that connect otherwise disconnected regions of the network, enabling motif guided screening by expanding from known motifs to nearby materials in the same neighborhoods. A network embedding step converts this weighted connectivity into vector representations of materials. Using these motif informed embeddings, property prediction yields a formation energy mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.157 eV per atom and a bandgap MAE of 0.601 eV. These results indicate that motif connectivity provides a compact, interpretable representation that complements existing descriptors for scalable screening and structure property modeling.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17170v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Topological hybridisation of plasmons with ferrimagnetic magnons</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18995</link><description>arXiv:2601.18995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the formation of hybrid plasmon-magnon modes in a heterostructure comprising a monolayer semiconductor with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling -- specifically, Janus transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) -- and an insulating ferrimagnet, such as yttrium iron garnet-based compounds. Using a combined microscopic-macroscopic framework for plasmon-magnon coupling, we show that plasmons and magnons strongly hybridize over both GHz and THz frequency ranges, enabling experimental access well above cryogenic temperatures. Moreover, the developed approach provides an efficient and natural classification of the topology of the hybrid modes, rooted in the phase winding of the plasmon-magnon coupling induced by spin-momentum locking and the associated chiral winding of the electronic spin along the Fermi contours. Finally, we identify experimentally accessible manifestations of the hybridization, such as topological interface modes and an anomalous thermal Hall response.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18995v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Creation of ultracold heteronuclear p-wave Feshbach molecules</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12858</link><description>arXiv:2601.12858v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the creation of optically trapped ultracold heteronuclear p-wave Feshbach molecules in a mixture of 23Na and 87Rb atoms. With loss spectroscopy and binding energy measurements, we systematically characterize the interspecies p-wave Feshbach resonances near 284 G.

Additionally, we investigate the inelastic loss of these molecules, primarily influenced by atom-molecule and molecule-molecule collisions. Our results represent a significant step toward realizing tunable p-wave interactions in heteronuclear ultracold systems and provide a foundation for exploring non-zero angular momentum molecules.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12858v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] GTAC: A Generative Transformer for Approximate Circuits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19906</link><description>arXiv:2601.19906v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: In last two years, large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in code generation, including hardware design at register-transfer level (RTL). While their use in high-level synthesis (HLS) remains comparatively less mature, the ratio of HLS- to RTL-focused studies has shifted from 1:10 to 2:10 in the past six months, indicating growing interest in leveraging LLMs for high-level design entry while relying on downstream synthesis for optimization. This growing trend highlights the need for a comprehensive benchmarking and evaluation framework dedicated to LLM-based HLS. To address this, We present Bench4HLS for evaluating LLM-generated HLS designs. Bench4HLS comprises 170 manually drafted and validated case studies, spanning small kernels to complex accelerators, curated from widely used public repositories. The framework supports fully automated assessment of compilation success, functional correctness via simulation, and synthesis feasibility/optimization. Crucially, Bench4HLS integrates a pluggable API for power, performance, and area (PPA) analysis across various HLS toolchains and architectures, demonstrated here with Xilinx Vitis HLS and validated on Catapult HLS. By providing a structured, extensible, and plug-and-play testbed, Bench4HLS establishes a foundational methodology for benchmarking LLMs in HLS workflows.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19941v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Primitive-Driven Acceleration of Hyperdimensional Computing for Real-Time Image Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20061</link><description>arXiv:2601.20061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) represents data using extremely high-dimensional, low-precision vectors, termed hypervectors (HVs), and performs learning and inference through lightweight, noise-tolerant operations. However, the high dimensionality, sparsity, and repeated data movement involved in HDC make these computations difficult to accelerate efficiently on conventional processors. As a result, executing core HDC operations: binding, permutation, bundling, and similarity search: on CPUs or GPUs often leads to suboptimal utilization, memory bottlenecks, and limits on real-time performance. In this paper, our contributions are two-fold. First, we develop an image-encoding algorithm that, similar in spirit to convolutional neural networks, maps local image patches to hypervectors enriched with spatial information. These patch-level hypervectors are then merged into a global representation using the fundamental HDC operations, enabling spatially sensitive and robust image encoding. This encoder achieves 95.67% accuracy on MNIST and 85.14% on Fashion-MNIST, outperforming prior HDC-based image encoders. Second, we design an end-to-end accelerator that implements these compute operations on an FPGA through a pipelined architecture that exploits parallelism both across the hypervector dimensionality and across the set of image patches. Our Alveo U280 implementation delivers 0.09ms inference latency, achieving up to 1300x and 60x speedup over state-of-the-art CPU and GPU baselines, respectively.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20061v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] A Paradigm for Generalized Multi-Level Priority Encoders</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20067</link><description>arXiv:2601.20067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Priority encoders are typically considered expensive hardware components in terms of complexity, especially at high bit precisions or input lengths (e.g., above 512 bits). However, if the complexity can be reduced, priority encoders can feasibly accelerate a variety of key applications, such as high-precision integer arithmetic and content-addressable memory. We propose a new paradigm for constructing priority encoders by generalizing the previously proposed two-level priority encoder structure. We extend this concept to three and four levels using two techniques -- cascading and composition -- and discuss further generalization. We then analyze the complexity and delay of new and existing priority encoder designs as a function of input length, for both FPGA and ASIC implementation technologies. In particular, we compare the multi-level structure to the traditional single-level priority encoder structure, a tree-based design, a recursive design, and the two-level structure. We find that the two-level architecture provides balanced performance -- reducing complexity by around half, but at the cost of a corresponding increase in delay. Additional levels have diminishing returns, highlighting a tradeoff between complexity and delay. Meanwhile, the tree and recursive designs are generally faster, but are more complex than the two-level and multi-level structures. We explore several characteristics and patterns of the designs across a wide range of input lengths. We then provide recommendations on which architecture to use for a given input length and implementation technology, based on which design factors -- such as complexity or delay -- are most important to the hardware designer. With this overview and analysis of various priority encoder architectures, we provide a priority encoder toolkit to assist hardware designers in creating the most optimal design.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20067v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Continuous-Flow Data-Rate-Aware CNN Inference on FPGA</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19940</link><description>arXiv:2601.19940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among hardware accelerators for deep-learning inference, data flow implementations offer low latency and high throughput capabilities. In these architectures, each neuron is mapped to a dedicated hardware unit, making them well-suited for field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation. Previous unrolled implementations mostly focus on fully connected networks because of their simplicity, although it is well known that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require fewer computations for the same accuracy. When observing the data flow in CNNs, pooling layers and convolutional layers with a stride larger than one, the number of data at their output is reduced with respect to their input. This data reduction strongly affects the data rate in a fully parallel implementation, making hardware units heavily underutilized unless it is handled properly. This work addresses this issue by analyzing the data flow of CNNs and presents a novel approach to designing data-rate-aware, continuous-flow CNN architectures. The proposed approach ensures a high hardware utilization close to 100% by interleaving low data rate signals and sharing hardware units, as well as using the right parallelization to achieve the throughput of a fully parallel implementation. The results show that a significant amount of the arithmetic logic can be saved, which allows implementing complex CNNs like MobileNet on a single FPGA with high throughput.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19940v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Low-Latency FPGA Control System for Real-Time Neural Network Processing in CCD-Based Trapped-Ion Qubit Measurement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15838</link><description>arXiv:2512.15838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and low-latency qubit state measurement is critical for trapped-ion quantum computing. While deep neural networks (DNNs) have been integrated to enhance detection fidelity, their latency performance on specific hardware platforms remains underexplored. This work benchmarks the latency of DNN-based qubit detection on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). The FPGA solution directly interfaces an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) with the subsequent data processing logic, eliminating buffering and interface overheads. As a baseline, the GPU-based system employs a high-speed PCIe image grabber for image input and I/O card for state output. We deploy Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models on hardware to evaluate measurement performance. Compared to conventional thresholding, DNNs reduce the mean measurement fidelity (MMF) error by factors of 1.8-2.5x (one-qubit case) and 4.2-7.6x (three-qubit case). FPGA-based MLP and ViT achieve nanosecond- and microsecond-scale inference latencies, while the complete single-shot measurement process achieves over 100x speedup compared to the GPU implementation. Additionally, clock-cycle-level signal analysis reveals inefficiencies in EMCCD data transmission via Cameralink, suggesting that optimizing this interface could further leverage the advantages of ultra-low-latency DNN inference, guiding the development of next-generation qubit detection systems.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.15838v2</guid></item><item><title>[Nature] Critical social media posts linked to retractions of scientific papers</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-04146-6</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature, Published online: 29 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-04146-6"&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-025-04146-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Online discussions can catch errors or fraud in articles that can be missed in peer review.</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-04146-6</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Prenatal Zika virus exposure disrupts social-emotional development and cortical visual function in infant macaques</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68517-x</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 29 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68517-x"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-68517-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Prenatal Zika virus (ZIKV) exposure can lead to a spectrum of developmental issues, but the mechanisms remain unclear.

However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying SOC dynamics across urbanization gradients in urban forests remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the interrelationships among plant diversity, SOC and its oxidation-stable fractions, and functional genes across an urbanization gradient encompassing an urban center (UC), subcenter, suburb, and exurb. Our findings revealed that urbanization significantly enhanced plant diversity and altered SOC dynamics.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00231-2?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Discovery of Key Regulators in Classical Monocyte Phenotypes Linked to COVID-19 Severity using Single-cell Multi-omics Sequencing</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00224-5?rss=yes</link><description>Dysregulated immune responses often accompany severe COVID-19, but the underlying epigenetic mechanisms driving monocyte heterogeneity and COVID-19 progression remain unclear. Here, we applied single-cell multi-omics profiling to peripheral blood mononuclear cells across healthy and four COVID-19 severity stages. We identified two severity-associated classical monocyte subtypes-IL7R+ and CD163+, These subtypes exhibit distinct transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes. By constructing a gene regulatory network and in silico perturbations, we revealed that ETS1 is a key driver of IL7R+ monocytes with T cell-like signaling features and that JDP2 is a repressor that maintains the profibrotic, anti-inflammatory identity of CD163+ monocytes by suppressing AP-1 activity.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00224-5?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Multi-Cohort and Single-Cell Profiling of Aging Genes Reveals Prognostic and Therapeutic Targets in Breast Cancer</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00222-1?rss=yes</link><description>Aging-related transcriptional programs shape breast cancer progression, immune regulation, and therapeutic response. We integrated curated aging-associated genes with 108 survival modeling strategies to derive a machine learning–based aging gene signature. Trained in the TCGA-BRCA cohort and evaluated across twelve independent datasets, the eight-gene MLAG score consistently stratified patients by survival risk across clinical contexts. High MLAG exhibited increased genomic instability, including elevated tumor mutational burden and copy number alterations, together with distinct regulatory and intercellular communication patterns.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00222-1?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Regulation of sebaceous gland homeostasis and sebum secretion by the ERBB receptor family</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00209-9?rss=yes</link><description>ERBB receptors are underappreciated regulators of cellular processes in the sebaceous gland (SG). They control sebocyte proliferation, differentiation, and lipid production - mechanisms that are essential for SG homeostasis, sebum secretion, and skin health. Also, impaired ERBB signaling is associated with diseases such as acne, SG hyperplasia or skin adverse effects to some cancer therapies. By addressing current findings and unsolved aspects of ERBB signaling in the SG, this review aims to encourage deeper investigation to identify potential therapeutic strategies for common and chronic skin conditions.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00209-9?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Evolutionarily entrenched odorant receptors for (E)-β-farnesene signaling in Aphidinae aphids</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00160-4?rss=yes</link><description>Alarm pheromones are crucial for the survival of social insects, enabling coordinated escape from predators. Their evolution has co-evolved with the development of olfactory recognition systems, suggesting specific molecular mechanisms underlie this adaptive relationship. We analyzed alarm pheromone compositions across 36 aphid species and found that EBF serves as the sole or primary alarm signal in the Aphidinae subfamily. Genomic annotation of 13 aphid species identified eight conserved, Aphidinae-specific odorant receptor (OR) clades under strong purifying selection.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00160-4?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] PCMTD1-127aa suppresses osteosarcoma progression by competitively binding to USP10 to promote c-MYC degradation</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00140-9?rss=yes</link><description>Osteosarcoma (OS) is a highly malignant tumour prone to distant metastasis and is associated with an poor prognosis. To date, therapeutic outcomes for this disease remain unsatisfactory. In this study, we found that circPCMTD1 encodes a 127-amino acid protein, termed PCMTD1-127aa in OS. The expression of PCMTD1-127aa was significantly lower in OS tissues than in normal paratumoral tissues. Clinical data analysis revealed that low expression of PCMTD1-127aa was associated with poor OS prognosis. Functionally, overexpression of PCMTD1-127aa not only inhibited the proliferation and invasion of osteosarcoma cells but also suppressed glycolysis in these cells.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00140-9?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Dynamic Crystal Photonics: Mechanically Mobile Organic Nonlinear Optical Microring Resonators</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c17711</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c17711/asset/images/medium/ja5c17711_0008.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c17711&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 19:48:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c17711</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Enantioselective Functionalization of Light Alkanes and C(sp3)–H Bonds via Photoinduced Palladium Catalysis</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c19864</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c19864/asset/images/medium/ja5c19864_0008.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c19864&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 19:38:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c19864</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Acta Materialia] Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CrSi thin film as magnetocaloric refrigerant to liquefy/solidify high-boiling-point harmful organic substances and its associated critical phenomena</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359645426000704?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: Available online 24 January 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Acta Materialia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Sourav Mandal, Tapan Kumar Nath&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Acta Materialia</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 18:27:13 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359645426000704</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Energy Storage] Hygrothermal performance of diatomite PCM composite walls for energy-efficient construction in hot-arid climates</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X26003816?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: 30 March 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of Energy Storage, Volume 152, Part B&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Hakim Bentrar, Houssem Hachemi, Chakib Seladji, M.

Abstract: Gelation in the Smoluchowski coagulation equation is commonly interpreted as a finite-time singularity marked by mass loss or moment divergence. We instead characterize gelation as a loss of dynamical stability of the Smoluchowski flow, quantified through the time-dependent spectrum of the Jacobian along the evolving aggregation dynamics. Studying homogeneous kernels $K(i,j)=(ij)^{\alpha}$ together with the classical Smoluchowski, we show that gelation is consistently preceded by the appearance of positive real eigenvalues, indicating a loss of local dynamical stability. While non-gelling kernels exhibit only transient finite-size effects, gelling kernels display persistent spectral destabilization associated with macroscopic gel formation. Our results identify gelation as a genuine dynamical instability of the Smoluchowski flow.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18806v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Topological hybridisation of plasmons with ferrimagnetic magnons</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18995</link><description>arXiv:2601.18995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the formation of hybrid plasmon-magnon modes in a heterostructure comprising a monolayer semiconductor with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling -- specifically, Janus transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) -- and an insulating ferrimagnet, such as yttrium iron garnet-based compounds. Using a combined microscopic-macroscopic framework for plasmon-magnon coupling, we show that plasmons and magnons strongly hybridize over both GHz and THz frequency ranges, enabling experimental access well above cryogenic temperatures. Moreover, the developed approach provides an efficient and natural classification of the topology of the hybrid modes, rooted in the phase winding of the plasmon-magnon coupling induced by spin-momentum locking and the associated chiral winding of the electronic spin along the Fermi contours. Finally, we identify experimentally accessible manifestations of the hybridization, such as topological interface modes and an anomalous thermal Hall response.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18995v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Fundamental Tests of Quantum Geometric Bounds in Ionic and Covalent Insulators using Inelastic X-Ray Scattering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19054</link><description>arXiv:2601.19054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum geometry underlies many fundamental properties of materials, but it has remained largely inaccessible to direct experiment. Here we demonstrate that inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) provides a direct, quantitative probe of quantum geometry and quantum information in solids. Studying two prototype insulators, covalently bonded diamond and ionically bonded LiF, we measure the density response and experimentally determine the quantum Fisher information, the associated Bures metric, and the electron localization length. These measurements enable a quantitative comparison of quantum geometry for two distinct bonding environments. We find that the dimensionless quantum weight, $aK(q)$, which quantifies the longitudinal localization of quantum information, is constrained by fundamental electrostatic bounds in both materials. Crucially, the quantum weight of diamond exceeds that of LiF, indicating that covalent bonds exhibit a higher degree of delocalization and higher density of quantum information than the ionic bonds. Our results establish a direct experimental relationship between quantum information, electron localization, and chemical bonding, and identify IXS as a powerful tool for measuring quantum geometry in materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19054v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] $PT$ Symmetry's Real Topology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19069</link><description>arXiv:2601.19069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry-protected topological phases have been a central theme in condensed matter physics and beyond over the past two decades. Most efforts have focused on topological classifications of physical systems under given symmetries, while the intrinsic topology of the symmetries themselves has received much less attention. Here, we show that, in generic non-interacting spinless crystals, the spacetime inversion symmetry $PT$ naturally carries a real vector-bundle structure whose topology is characterized by Stiefel--Whitney (SW) classes. In contrast to previous work, where SW classes were used to describe the topology of real valence bundles protected by $PT$, we identify SW classes associated to the $PT$ symmetry itself. These symmetry SW classes can endow the \emph{total} real bundle of a $PT$-symmetric band structure with nontrivial topology, overturning the common assumption that the total bundle is always trivial. As a consequence, valence and conduction bands can exhibit asymmetric SW classes, in sharp contrast to the usual symmetric scenario. We further demonstrate that the symmetry SW classes provide a refined distinction between atomic insulator phases. Our results underscore the importance of treating crystal symmetries as topological objects in their own right, rather than focusing solely on the topology of energy bands.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19069v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Mapping optical, chemical, structural features in ZrO2 via cross-sectional SEM-Cathodoluminescence correlation microscopy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19428</link><description>arXiv:2601.19428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how nanoscale heterogeneities influence charge transport and mass transfer in oxides is critical for developing advanced materials for energy and electronic uses. In high-temperature applications, the formation of thermal oxides with complex chemical and structural features plays a central role in material lifetime. While thermally grown zirconia (ZrO2) on zirconium alloys exhibits strong chemical and microstructural gradients across the oxide thickness, linking these heterogeneities to electronic-defect landscapes remains challenging. We demonstrate cross-sectional scanning electron microscope-cathodoluminescence (SEM-CL) as a mesoscale probe of spatial variations in luminescence in zirconia and establish correlations with co-registered electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA) on the same region. The SEM-CL signal is dominated by the ~2.7 eV defect band, but its intensity varies strongly across the oxide cross section. Correlative EBSD-CL analysis reveals that CL intensity increases with grain area and decreases at the grain boundaries, consistent with enhanced non-radiative recombination associated with microstructural disorder. EPMA mapping shows that a substantial fraction of CL-dark features co-localize with secondary phase precipitates enriched in iron. These results show that SEM-CL contrast in corrosion-grown ZrO2 is controlled by both chemical heterogeneity and microstructural disorder, underscoring the need for correlative registration to interpret CL images. This multi-modal approach provides an efficient route to connect electronic properties and luminescence signatures across complex oxide cross sections to underlying chemistry and microstructure, thereby providing a pathway to relate local defect landscapes to regions likely to bias electronic/ionic transport during oxidation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19428v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Charge redistribution at metal-ZrO2 interfaces: A combined DFT and continuum electrostatic study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19436</link><description>arXiv:2601.19436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoscale metallic inclusions (NMIs) are commonly observed within oxide scales formed during high-temperature oxidation, revealing the existence of chemical and electronic heterogeneity beyond conventional corrosion theories that assume homogeneous, fully oxidized films. Using tetragonal zirconia (tZrO2) facing a series of face-centered cubic (fcc) metals as the model system, this work investigates the short-range and long-range charge redistributions across metal-oxide interfaces by coupling density functional theory (DFT) calculations with continuum modeling. We show that metal-oxide contact induces a short-range charge redistribution confined to a few atomic layers and a long-range redistribution of space charge that can extend over macroscopic distances within weakly doped oxides. DFT calculations show that the short-range redistribution is dominated by metal induced gap states (MIGS) in tZrO2 facing noble metals like Au and Ag, and by chemical bonding in tZrO2 facing active metals like Al. DFT-informed continuum theoretical analysis shows that the range of space-charge redistribution is governed by the doping level of tZrO2, and that the Schottky barrier height (SBH) exhibits a stronger dependence on the metal work function than the doping level. Both the short-range and long-range charge redistributions can alter the transport of charge carriers via their associated electric fields, extending several nm to hundreds of nm from the interface, depending on the doping concentrations, suggesting possible heterogeneous oxide growth caused by NMIs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19436v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Twisting Kelvin Cells for Enhanced Vibration Control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18911</link><description>arXiv:2601.18911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the propagation of elastic waves in periodic Kelvin-cell chains, focusing on symmetry-breaking geometric modifications induced by twisting the cell's faces. By imposing such twists, the original lattice topology is preserved, while mirror symmetries are strategically broken through modifying a single geometric parameter, allowing wave characteristics to be adjusted without additional resonators or mass augmentation. The complex-valued Bloch-Floquet analysis reveals that twisting activates two distinct wave attenuation mechanisms: Bragg-type band gaps associated with periodicity-induced scattering, and polarization-dependent band gaps arising from longitudinal-torsional mode coupling and avoided crossings. To obtain qualitative and quantitative insight into these mechanisms, a simplified analytical model with coupled translational and rotational degrees of freedom is considered. The finite-element wave transmission calculations are experimentally validated on SLA-printed three-cell specimens, for which wave attenuation reaches up to 20 dB within the predicted band-gap frequencies. Note that high prediction accuracy requires accounting for viscoelastic material behavior, underscoring the importance of material behavior on the wave propagation characteristics. Overall, the findings show that modest geometric modifications to a classical Kelvin-cell lattice can enhance wave-filtering behavior, offering a tractable design strategy for vibration control in lightweight architected lattices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18911v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Configurable p-Neurons Using Modular p-Bits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18943</link><description>arXiv:2601.18943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic bits (p-bits) have recently been employed in neural networks (NNs) as stochastic neurons with sigmoidal probabilistic activation functions. Nonetheless, there remain a wealth of other probabilistic activation functions that are yet to be explored. Here we re-engineer the p-bit by decoupling its stochastic signal path from its input data path, giving rise to a modular p-bit that enables the realization of probabilistic neurons (p-neurons) with a range of configurable probabilistic activation functions, including a probabilistic version of the widely used Logistic Sigmoid, Tanh and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation functions. We present spintronic (CMOS + sMTJ) designs that show wide and tunable probabilistic ranges of operation. Finally, we experimentally implement digital-CMOS versions on an FPGA, with stochastic unit sharing, and demonstrate an order of magnitude (10x) saving in required hardware resources compared to conventional digital p-bit implementations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18943v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Nonequilibrium phase transitions in a racism-spreading model with interaction-driven dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19806</link><description>arXiv:2601.19806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Racism remains a persistent societal issue, increasingly amplified by the structure and dynamics of online social networks. In this work, we propose a three-state compartmental model to study the spreading and suppression of racist content, drawing from epidemic-like dynamics and interaction-driven transitions. We analyze the model on fully-connected (homogeneous mixing) networks using a set of coupled differential equations, and on Barab\'asi-Albert (BA) scale-free and Watts-Strogatz (WS) small-world networks through agent-based simulations. The system exhibits three distinct stationary regimes: two racism-free absorbing states and one active phase with persistent racist content. We identify and characterize the phase transitions between these regimes, discuss the role of network topology, and highlight the emergence of absorbing states. Our findings illustrate how statistical physics tools can help uncover the macroscopic consequences of microscopic social interactions in digital environments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19806v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Bipartite Fluctuations and Charge Fractionalization in Quantum Wires</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14410</link><description>arXiv:2501.14410v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum information method for measuring fractional charges in ballistic quantum wires generalizing bipartite fluctuations to the chiral quasiparticles in Luttinger liquids, i.e. analyzing and summing charge and current fluctuations in a region of the wire. Bipartite fluctuations at equilibrium are characterized through a logarithmic scaling with distance encoding the entangled nature of these fractional charges in one-dimensional (1D) fluids. This approach clarifies the physical meaning of the dephasing factor of electronic interferences in a ballistic ring geometry at zero temperature, as a result of charge fractionalization. We formulate an analogy towards ground-state energetics. We show how bipartite current fluctuations represent a useful tool to locate quantum phase transitions associated to Mott physics. We address a spin chain equivalence and verify the fractional charges through an algorithm such as Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). Adding a potential difference between the two sides (parties) of the wire, bipartite fluctuations can detect a bound state localized at the interface through the Jackiw-Rebbi model coexisting with fractional charges.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.14410v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Absorbing state transitions with discrete symmetries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08702</link><description>arXiv:2502.08702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robust phases of matter, which remain stable under small perturbations, are of fundamental importance in statistical physics and quantum information. Recent advances in interactive quantum dynamics have led to renewed interest in out-of-equilibrium dynamical phases and associated phase transitions in both classical and quantum many-body systems. Motivated by these developments, we investigate whether a stable absorbing phase can exist in one-dimensional classical stochastic systems, with local update rules, in the presence of fluctuations. We study models with multiple absorbing states related by discrete symmetries, such as Z2 for two-state systems, and Z3 or S3 for three-state systems. In these models, domain walls perform random walks and coarsen under local rules, which, if perfect, eventually bring the system to an absorbing state in polynomial time. However, imperfect feedback can cause domain walls to branch, potentially leading to an opposing active phase. While two-state models exhibit a well-known transition between absorbing and active phases as the branching rate increases, in three-state models with only local dynamics, branching is a relevant perturbation, ruling out a robust absorbing phase under purely local rules. However, we discover that by incorporating nonlocal information into the feedback, the absorbing phase can be stabilized, with the transition between the active and absorbing phases belonging to a new universality class. Finally, we outline how these classical rules can be implemented using deterministic quantum circuits and discuss their connections to passive error correction.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.08702v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spin-Orbital Intertwined Topological Superconductivity in a Class of Correlated Noncentrosymmetric Materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10392</link><description>arXiv:2504.10392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we propose an alternative route to achieving topological superconductivity (TSC). Our approach applies to a new class of correlated noncentrosymmetric materials that host two spin-split Fermi surfaces with identical spin textures due to a spin-orbital intertwined effect. Incorporating multi-orbital repulsive Hubbard interactions, we calculate the superconducting pairings of a minimal two-orbital effective model within a spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity framework. We find that, depending on the effective Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) strength and filling level, the Hubbard interaction can drive the leading pairing symmetry into the $A_1(S_{\pm})$, $B_1$, $B_2$ or $B_2(d_{\pm})$ irreducible representations (IRs) of the $C_{4v}$ point group. Notably, the $A_1(S_{\pm})$ pairing gives rise to a fully gapped TSC characterized by a $Z_2$ invariant, while the $B_2(d_{\pm})$ pairing results in a nodal TSC. Our analysis reveals that the fully gapped TSC is predominated by spin-singlet regardless of the presence of the spin-triplet components. This distinguishes our model from noncentrosymmetric materials with conventional Rashba-split band structures, where TSC typically emerges near the van Hove singularity and is primarily driven by $p$-wave or $f$-wave spin-triplet pairing. These features enhances its experimental accessibility, and we discuss potential experimental systems for its realization.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.10392v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Fermion quantum criticality far from equilibrium</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14318</link><description>arXiv:2507.14318v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driving a quantum system out of equilibrium while preserving its subtle quantum mechanical correlations on large scales presents a major challenge, both fundamentally and for technological applications. At its core, this challenge is pinpointed by the question of how quantum effects can persist at asymptotic scales, analogous to quantum critical points in equilibrium. In this work, we construct such a scenario using fermions as building blocks. These fermions undergo an absorbing-to-absorbing state transition between two topologically distinct and quantum-correlated dark states. Starting from a microscopic, interacting Lindbladian, we derive an effective Lindblad-Keldysh field theory in which critical fermions couple to a bosonic bath with hydrodynamic fluctuations associated with particle number conservation. A key feature of this field theory is an emergent symmetry that protects the purity of the fermions' state even in the presence of the thermal bath. We quantitatively characterise the critical point using a leading-order expansion around the upper critical dimension, thereby establishing the first non-equilibrium universality class of fermions. The symmetry protection mechanism, which exhibits parallels to the problem of directed percolation, suggests a pathway toward a broader class of robust, universal quantum phenomena in fermionic systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.14318v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Detuning the Floquet anomalous chiral spin liquid</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23418</link><description>arXiv:2512.23418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At high-frequency a periodically-driven quantum spin-1/2 system can emulate a chiral spin liquid (CSL) described by an effective static local chiral Hamiltonian. In contrast, at low-frequency these settings realize "Swap" models exhibiting {\it anomalous} CSL phases, in which one-way spin transport occurs at the edge although the bulk time-evolution operator over one period is trivial. In this work we explicitly construct a family of Floquet quantum spin-1/2 models on the square lattice implementing Swap models to investigate the stability of the anomalous CSL under frequency detuning and the transition to the high-frequency regime. We used the average-energy spectrum on finite-size torus and cylinders to unfold the Floquet quasi-energy spectrum over the whole frequency range and obtain the geometrical Berry phases. This enabled us to identify three regimes upon increasing detuning: i) a finite-size regime (with no folding of the Floquet spectrum), ii) an intermediate (narrow) regime with folding and very few resonances and iii) a regime with an increased density of resonances suggesting heating. At small detuning, edge modes are revealed by spectroscopic tools and from the Streda response of the system giving access to the anomalous winding number. The analysis of all the data suggests that the anomalous CSL is not continuously connected to the high-frequency CSL. We also discuss the possible occurrence of a long-lived prethermal anomalous CSL.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23418v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Majorana Fermions in spin up and down electronic complexes in spin-orbit coupled array of semiconductor quantum dots in proximity to $s$-type superconductor and in magnetic field</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14527</link><description>arXiv:2601.14527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semiconductor-s-type superconductor nanowires host spinful fermions and cannot be reduced to a single spinless Kitaev chain hosting single Majorana zero mode. Instead, such systems can be converted into two coupled p-wave Kitaev-like chains associated with different spin sectors. Using the bond Fermion transformation and exact diagonalization, we analyze parity resolved spectra and local spectral functions, demonstrating that zero-energy modes strongly localized at the system boundaries emerge only in one effective chain. Inter-chain coupling lifts parity degeneracy and redistributes the low-energy spectral weight, providing a controlled framework to assess the stability of Majorana-like modes in the finite spinful nanowires.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14527v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Magnetic structure of EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$ single-crystal thin-film</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16365</link><description>arXiv:2601.16365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic topological materials are a class of compounds which can host massless electrons controlled by the magnetic order. One such compound is EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$, which has recently garnered interest due to its strong interplay between the Eu magnetism and charge carriers. However the topology of the electronic band structure, which depends on the ground state magnetic configuration of the europium sublattice, has not been determined. Based on our \textit{ab-initio} calculations, we find that an in-plane and out-of-plane \textit{A}-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) order generates a topological crystalline insulator and Dirac semimetal respectively, whereas a ferromagnetic (FM) order stabilizes a Weyl semimetal. Our resonant x-ray elastic scattering measurements of single-crystal thin film EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$ reveal both a sharp magnetic peak at $\textit{\textbf{Q}}$=$(0,0,\frac{1}{2})$ and broad $\textit{\textbf{Q}}$=$(0,0,1)$ below $T_{\mathrm{N}}=12.9$\,K, which is associated with an \textit{A}-type AFM and FM order, respectively. Our measurements indicate that the FM and AFM layers are spatially separated along the crystal $c$ axis, with the former limited to the top three atomic layers. We propose that EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$ behaves as a Weyl semimetal in the surface FM layers, and as a topological crystalline insulator in the lower AFM layers.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16365v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Generalized Wigner theorem for non-invertible symmetries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25327</link><description>arXiv:2509.25327v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the conditions under which a conservation law associated with a non-invertible operator may be realized as a symmetry in quantum mechanics. As established by Wigner, all quantum symmetries must be represented by either unitary or antiunitary transformations. Relinquishing an implicit assumption of invertibility, we demonstrate that the fundamental invariance of quantum transition probabilities under the application of symmetries mandates that all non-invertible symmetries may only correspond to {\it projective} unitary or antiunitary transformations, i.e., {\it partial isometries}. This extends the notion of physical states beyond conventional rays in Hilbert space to equivalence classes in an {\it extended, gauged Hilbert space}, thereby broadening the traditional understanding of symmetry transformations in quantum theory. We discuss consequences of this result and explicitly illustrate how, in simple model systems, whether symmetries be invertible or non-invertible may be inextricably related to the particular boundary conditions that are being used.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.25327v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] A Reconfigurable Framework for AI-FPGA Agent Integration and Acceleration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19263</link><description>arXiv:2601.19263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly deployed in real-time and energy-constrained environments, driving demand for hardware platforms that can deliver high performance and power efficiency. While central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) have traditionally served as the primary inference engines, their general-purpose nature often leads to inefficiencies under strict latency or power budgets. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer a promising alternative by enabling custom-tailored parallelism and hardware-level optimizations. However, mapping AI workloads to FPGAs remains challenging due to the complexity of hardware-software co-design and data orchestration. This paper presents AI FPGA Agent, an agent-driven framework that simplifies the integration and acceleration of deep neural network inference on FPGAs. The proposed system employs a runtime software agent that dynamically partitions AI models, schedules compute-intensive layers for hardware offload, and manages data transfers with minimal developer intervention. The hardware component includes a parameterizable accelerator core optimized for high-throughput inference using quantized arithmetic. Experimental results demonstrate that the AI FPGA Agent achieves over 10x latency reduction compared to CPU baselines and 2-3x higher energy efficiency than GPU implementations, all while preserving classification accuracy within 0.2% of full-precision references. These findings underscore the potential of AI-FPGA co-design for scalable, energy-efficient AI deployment.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19263v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] GenPairX: A Hardware-Algorithm Co-Designed Accelerator for Paired-End Read Mapping</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19384</link><description>arXiv:2601.19384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genome sequencing has become a central focus in computational biology. A genome study typically begins with sequencing, which produces millions to billions of short DNA fragments known as reads. Read mapping aligns these reads to a reference genome. Read mapping for short reads comes in two forms: single-end and paired-end, with the latter being more prevalent due to its higher accuracy and support for advanced analysis. Read mapping remains a major performance bottleneck in genome analysis due to expensive dynamic programming. Prior efforts have attempted to mitigate this cost by employing filters to identify and potentially discard computationally expensive matches and leveraging hardware accelerators to speed up the computations. While partially effective, these approaches have limitations. In particular, existing filters are often ineffective for paired-end reads, as they evaluate each read independently and exhibit relatively low filtering ratios. In this work, we propose GenPairX, a hardware-algorithm co-designed accelerator that efficiently minimizes the computational load of paired-end read mapping while enhancing the throughput of memory-intensive operations. GenPairX introduces: (1) a novel filtering algorithm that jointly considers both reads in a pair to improve filtering effectiveness, and a lightweight alignment algorithm to replace most of the computationally expensive dynamic programming operations, and (2) two specialized hardware mechanisms to support the proposed algorithms. Our evaluations show that GenPairX delivers substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art solutions, achieving 1575x and 1.43x higher throughput per watt compared to leading CPU-based and accelerator-based read mappers, respectively, all without compromising accuracy.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19384v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Veri-Sure: A Contract-Aware Multi-Agent Framework with Temporal Tracing and Formal Verification for Correct RTL Code Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19747</link><description>arXiv:2601.19747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of Electronic Design Automation (EDA), the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Register-Transfer Level (RTL) design has emerged as a promising direction. However, silicon-grade correctness remains bottlenecked by: (i) limited test coverage and reliability of simulation-centric evaluation, (ii) regressions and repair hallucinations introduced by iterative debugging, and (iii) semantic drift as intent is reinterpreted across agent handoffs. In this work, we propose Veri-Sure, a multi-agent framework that establishes a design contract to align agents' intent and uses a patching mechanism guided by static dependency slicing to perform precise, localized repairs. By integrating a multi-branch verification pipeline that combines trace-driven temporal analysis with formal verification consisting of assertion-based checking and boolean equivalence proofs, Veri-Sure enables functional correctness beyond pure simulations. We also introduce VerilogEval-v2-EXT, extending the original benchmark with 53 more industrial-grade design tasks and stratified difficulty levels, and show that Veri-Sure achieves state-of-the-art verified-correct RTL code generation performance, surpassing standalone LLMs and prior agentic systems.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19747v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Is Finer Better? The Limits of Microscaling Formats in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19026</link><description>arXiv:2601.19026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microscaling data formats leverage per-block tensor quantization to enable aggressive model compression with limited loss in accuracy. Unlocking their potential for efficient training and inference necessitates hardware-friendly implementations that handle matrix multiplications in a native format and adopt efficient error-mitigation strategies. Herein, we report the emergence of a surprising behavior associated with microscaling quantization, whereas the output of a quantized model degrades as block size is decreased below a given threshold. This behavior clashes with the expectation that a smaller block size should allow for a better representation of the tensor elements. We investigate this phenomenon both experimentally and theoretically, decoupling the sources of quantization error behind it. Experimentally, we analyze the distributions of several Large Language Models and identify the conditions driving the anomalous behavior. Theoretically, we lay down a framework showing remarkable agreement with experimental data from pretrained model distributions and ideal ones. Overall, we show that the anomaly is driven by the interplay between narrow tensor distributions and the limited dynamic range of the quantized scales. Based on these insights, we propose the use of FP8 unsigned E5M3 (UE5M3) as a novel hardware-friendly format for the scales in FP4 microscaling data types. We demonstrate that UE5M3 achieves comparable performance to the conventional FP8 unsigned E4M3 scales while obviating the need of global scaling operations on weights and activations.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19026v1</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Development of Accurate Transferable Hydrofluorocarbon Refrigerant Force Fields Using a Machine Learning and Optimization Approach</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00537J</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, Accepted Manuscript&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00537J, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Montana N.

We identify CCT3 as a driver of ccRCC progression by enhancing XPO1 stability via correct folding, confirmed by Co-IP and GST pull-down. This promotes nuclear export of tumor suppressors like RB1 and p21, suppressing cellular senescence. Indeed, experimental evidence showed significantly reduced senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity and altered expression patterns of senescence markers (e.g., p21, CDK4, and Cyclin D) in the presence of increased CCT3.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00215-4?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Submedius Thalamic Inputs Shape the Presynaptic Architecture of Layer 5 Orbitofrontal Cortex in Mice</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00203-8?rss=yes</link><description>The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is central to cognitive and social functions, yet its presynaptic partners remain incompletely defined. In female mice, the OFC modulates infant-directed caregiving behaviors in an experience-dependent manner. Here, we identify the submedius thalamus (SMT) as a major presynaptic partner of the OFC. Trans-synaptic tracing revealed intensive inputs from both the SMT and mediodorsal thalamus (MD) to OFC layer 5 excitatory neurons. We generated a Tnnt1-Cre mouse line that enables selective targeting of these higher-order thalamic nuclei.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00203-8?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Neural Investment Patterns Reflect Task Specialisation in the Leaf-Cutting Ant Acromyrmex subterraneus</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00195-1?rss=yes</link><description>Leaf-cutting ants are excellent models for studying the relationship between behaviour and brain investment because their pronounced division of labour is associated with worker differentiation. In Acromyrmex subterraneus, division of labour is linked to worker size, defining three subcastes – minor, media, and major – that typically perform tasks with distinct sensory demands.

In this study, we synthesized SmTe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; single crystals with a high residual resistivity ratio of 411. Transport measurements reveal pronounced Shubnikov–de Haas quantum oscillations below 30 K. The carriers in the observed Fermi pockets exhibit an extremely small effective mass of 0.119  m0 and a high mobility reaching  3.78×104   cm2  V−1  s−1. Furthermore, the material demonstrates remarkable anisotropic magnetoresistance, indicative of a highly anisotropic Fermi surface.

Abstract: Machine learning models for functional materials design require precise and informative representations of material systems. Common representations encode atomic composition and bonding but often do not include local coordination environments across chemically diverse crystals. Recurring structural motifs provide a motif level description of crystalline solids and can serve as interpretable descriptors for structure property learning. To analyze the motif connectivity in materials, we construct a bipartite material motif network from 131,548 Materials Project entries, with materials and motifs as the two node sets. Edges connect materials to their constituent motifs and are weighted by motif distortion, which quantifies the strength of each material motif association. Network connectivity is analyzed to identify motif-defined material clusters that capture recurring local geometries relevant to structure property trends. Most shared motifs act as hubs that connect otherwise disconnected regions of the network, enabling motif guided screening by expanding from known motifs to nearby materials in the same neighborhoods. A network embedding step converts this weighted connectivity into vector representations of materials. Using these motif informed embeddings, property prediction yields a formation energy mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.157 eV per atom and a bandgap MAE of 0.601 eV. These results indicate that motif connectivity provides a compact, interpretable representation that complements existing descriptors for scalable screening and structure property modeling.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17170v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Erbium Probes of Magnetic Order in a Layered van der Waals Material</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17516</link><description>arXiv:2601.17516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is growing interest in characterizing magnetic order and dynamics in two-dimensional magnets, yet most efforts to date rely on external probes that interrogate the sample from tens of nanometers away and inevitably average over that length scale. Here we use internal, lattice-embedded Er3+ defects in CrSBr as atomic-scale probes, accessing their telecom-band photoluminescence with spectroscopy and temperature-dependent confocal imaging to read out magnetism from within the material. At room temperature we observe narrow, long-lived photoluminescence (PL) lines in the telecom band, characteristic of erbium emitters. Upon cooling to 3 K and reheating, the Er3+ PL intensity and excited-state lifetime display pronounced thermal hysteresis with a minimum near 132 K, at the reported antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition of CrSBr. Remarkably, we observe magnetic signatures persisting over a broader temperature range than expected from bulk benchmarks, suggesting nanoscale magnetic order that locally survives beyond the nominal phase boundary. Further, a moderate in-plane field of 0.3 T shifts the PL minimum by +8 K, which we tentatively associate to field-biased ferromagnetic correlations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17516v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Breakdown of bosonic Thouless pump due to interaction in a quasiperiodic lattice</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18229</link><description>arXiv:2601.18229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of inter-particle interaction on the quantized Thouless pump in the bosonic quasiperiodic Aubry-Andr{\'e} model and find that the quantization of the pumped charge breaks down already for weak interactions. Furthermore, the pumped charge undergoes sharp changes as a function of interaction strength that we can attribute to the closing of specific doublon channels. As expected, the quantization revives in the hard-core limit at very large interaction strengths where the bosons are subject to a hardcore constraint. Interestingly, the stability of isolated doublons under the pump depends on the band they are in. For repulsive interactions and a suitably fixed pump period, doublons in the lowest band are pumped stably while doublons in higher bands dissociate during the pump with one particle decaying into a lower band. This asymmetry leads to the decay of the total energy over time, in stark contrast to the typical Floquet heating expected for a driven many-body system.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18229v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Direct observation of vortex liquid droplets in the iron pnictide superconductor CaKAs$_4$Fe$_4$ at $0.5T$_c$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18247</link><description>arXiv:2601.18247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type-II superconductors under magnetic fields are in a quantum coherent non-dissipative state as long as vortices remain pinned. Dissipation appears when vortices depin, eventually driven by thermal fluctuations. This can be associated to a melting transition between a vortex solid and a vortex liquid. This transition is almost always observed very close to T$_c$ when probed by macroscopic experiments. However, it remains unclear how the vortex solid responds to thermal fluctuations at the scale of individual vortices far from the melting transition. Here we use scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to visualize vortices in CaKAs$_4$Fe$_4$ (T$_c \approx$ 35 K). We find vortex liquid droplets-localized regions in space where vortices strongly fluctuate due to thermal exctiation-at temperatures as low as 0.5\,T$_c$. Our results show that the onset of dissipation at the local scale occurs at temperatures considerably below T$_c$ in type-II superconductors.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18247v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Role of transfer films and interfacial cracking in metallic sliding wear</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18603</link><description>arXiv:2601.18603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of wear particles in metallic sliding contacts remains debated. Classical views based on cold-welded junctions suggest that plastic yielding of the real contact area should lead to large wear coefficients, in apparent contradiction with the small values typically measured for metals. Here we argue that this discrepancy can be resolved if most junctions do not directly produce wear particles, but instead cause metal transfer and the formation of a weakly bound transfer film. Wear then occurs intermittently when fragments of this film detach due to crack propagation at the interface between the transfer film and the underlying bulk metal. We perform unlubricated reciprocating sliding experiments on nominally smooth stainless steel, brass, and aluminum. For steel on steel, the wear mass loss shows an initial stage with negligible mass change up to a sliding distance of $\sim 2.4 \ {\rm m}$, followed by a linear regime. Transfer-film formation in dissimilar-metal contacts is evidenced by optical imaging, net mass gain of the steel slider, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and the collected debris is flake-like. These observations support a transfer-film-controlled wear mechanism associated with cold-welded junctions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18603v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Unraveling Surface Chemistry of irreversible reduction of iron oxides through the Time-Resolved APXPS and Chemometrics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17052</link><description>arXiv:2601.17052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a study on the application of Time-Resolved Ambient Pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (TR-APXPS) in association with chemometric techniques, specifically Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multivariate Curve Resolution with Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS), to investigate the surface chemistry and dynamics of Fe2O3 reduction processes. The use of TR-APXPS allows for real-time monitoring of chemical changes at the surface of Iron oxides during reduction, providing valuable insights into the reaction mechanisms and kinetics involved. One key challenge in analyzing TR-APXPS data is the presence of overlapping peaks and complex spectral features, which can make accurate quantification and interpretation difficult. Traditional spectral fitting methods may struggle with these complexities and result in ambiguous or inaccurate results. However, the chemometric approaches are promising tools to overcome these challenges by extracting pure spectral profiles of individual chemical species and their temporal profiles from the complex and overlapping data. The results obtained from the TR-APXPS coupled with PCA and MCR-ALS analysis provide a detailed and precise understanding of the surface chemical changes during the Fe2O3 reduction. This includes identifying and following the formation of various intermediate species and their evolution over time, which permits later to establish correlations between surface chemistry and process conditions. The integration of both chemometric tools in TR-APXPS data analysis not only addresses the challenges associated with complex spectral features, but also contributes to a deeper understanding of the underlying chemical changes and their dynamics. The obtained results have significant implications for process optimization, material synthesis, and tailoring of material properties for specific applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17052v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Probing sine dilaton gravity with flow central charge</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17698</link><description>arXiv:2601.17698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a holographic c-function for sine dilaton gravity (sDG) in the domain wall gauge.

We reproduce the central charge of LCFT from the holographic c-function of sDG corresponding to the UV limit.

Abstract: Are there hidden dynamical common patterns in the evolution of social and cultural history? While the growing availability of digitized social data invites us to answer this question, prevailing quantitative methods often rely on deterministic snapshots or average effects. Such approaches overlook the continuous and inherently uncertain nature of historical trajectories. In this paper, we propose a framework for modeling historical dynamics as stochastic processes described by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). By viewing historical change through the lens of continuous-time dynamics, this framework provides a natural language to describe how structural trends and inherent random fluctuations interact to shape societal evolution. This approach allows us to handle the uncertainty in fragmentary historical records, moving beyond the dichotomy of structural determinism versus pure chance. We demonstrate that adopting this stochastic perspective unlocks a rich suite of analytical capabilities unavailable to static models. Specifically, we introduce methods to: (1) quantify the irreversibility; (2) detect exogenous perturbations; (3) perform multiple imputation for missing historical records. This framework offers a unified methodology for dissecting the stability, contingency, and dynamics of historical change.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17772v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Electronic analogue of Fourier optics with mass-less Dirac fermions scattered by quantum dot lattice</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11259</link><description>arXiv:2402.11259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of electron optics exploits the analogy between the movement of electrons or charged quasiparticles, primarily in two-dimensional materials subjected to electric and magnetic (EM) fields and the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a dielectric medium with varied refractive index. We significantly extend this analogy by introducing an electronic analogue of Fourier optics dubbed as Fourier electron optics (FEO) with massless Dirac fermions (MDF), namely the charge carriers of single-layer graphene under ambient conditions, by considering their scattering from a two-dimensional quantum dot lattice (TDQDL) treated within Lippmann-Schwinger formalism. By considering the scattering of MDF from TDQDL with a defect region, as well as the moir\'{e} pattern of twisted TDQDLs, we establish an electronic analogue of Babinet's principle in optics. Exploiting the similarity of the resulting differential scattering cross-section with the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern, we construct a dictionary for such FEO. Subsequently, we evaluate the resistivity of such scattered MDF using the Boltzmann approach as a function of the angle made between the direction of propagation of these charge-carriers and the symmetry axis of the dot-lattice, and Fourier analyze them to show that the spatial frequency associated with the angle-resolved resistivity gets filtered according to the structural changes in the dot lattice, indicating wider applicability of FEO of MDF.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2402.11259v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Current Flow in Topological Insulator Josephson Junctions due to Imperfections</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10335</link><description>arXiv:2411.10335v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments on planar superconductor-topological insulator-superconductor (S-TI-S) junctions, e.g., in Corbino geometry, have reported low-temperature nonzero Josephson currents in states with integer fluxoid (flux) induced in the junction by a perpendicular magnetic field. This effect was discussed in connection with Majorana zero modes localized in Josephson vortices of such junctions. Here, we provide an explanation for this phenomenon, attributing it to imperfections. We focus on the ``atomic" limit in which the low-energy bound states of different vortices do not overlap. In this limit, we can associate the nonvanishing critical current with the irregularities, e.g., in the junction's width. The low-temperature contribution to the current is provided by the bound states with low but nonzero energy. We also propose clear experimental tests based on microwave spectroscopy, revealing distinctive selection rules for vortex transitions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.10335v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Soft symmetries of topological orders</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03314</link><description>arXiv:2501.03314v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (2+1)D topological orders possess emergent symmetries given by a group $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$, which consists of the braided tensor autoequivalences of the modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ that describes the anyons. In this paper we discuss cases where $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$ has elements that neither permute anyons nor are associated to any symmetry fractionalization but are still non-trivial, which we refer to as soft symmetries. We point out that one can construct topological defects corresponding to such exotic symmetry actions by decorating with a certain class of gauged SPT states that cannot be distinguished by their torus partition function. This gives a physical interpretation to work by Davydov on soft braided tensor autoequivalences. This has a number of important implications for the classification of gapped boundaries, non-invertible spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the general classification of symmetry-enriched topological phases of matter. We also demonstrate analogous phenomena in higher dimensions, such as (3+1)D gauge theory with gauge group given by the quaternion group $Q_8$.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.03314v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Planar Josephson junction devices with narrow superconducting strips: Topological properties and optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04468</link><description>arXiv:2504.04468v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the low-energy physics of planar Josephson junction structures realized in a quasi-two dimensional semiconductor system proximity-coupled to narrow superconducting films. Using both a recursive Green's function approach and an effective Hamiltonian approximation, we investigate the topological superconducting phase predicted to emerge in this type of system. We first characterize the effects associated with varying the electrostatic potentials applied within the unproximitized semiconductor regions. We then address the problem of optimizing the width of the superconductor films and identifying the optimal regimes characterized by large topological gap values. We find that structures with narrow superconducting films of widths ranging between about $100~$nm and $200~$nm can support topological superconducting phases with gaps up to $40\%$ of the parent superconducting gap, significantly larger than those characterizing the corresponding wide-superconductor structures. This work represents the first component of a proposed comprehensive strategy to address this optimization problem in planar Josephson junction structures and realize robust topological devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.04468v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Strongly nonlinear Bernstein modes in graphene reveal plasmon-enhanced near-field magnetoabsorption</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25443</link><description>arXiv:2510.25443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bernstein modes -- hybrid magnetoplasmon excitations arising from the coupling between cyclotron motion and collective oscillations in two-dimensional electron systems -- offer direct access to non-local electrodynamics. These modes can exhibit rich nonlinear behavior akin to strong-coupling phenomena in cavity quantum electrodynamics, but reaching nonlinear regime has remained experimentally challenging. Here we report the observation of nonlinear Bernstein modes in graphene using terahertz excitation with near-field enhancement from embedded metallic contacts. Photoresistance spectroscopy reveals sharp resonances at Bc/2 and Bc/3 that saturate at radiation intensities nearly an order of magnitude lower than the cyclotron resonance. We ascribe this to strong local heating of the electron gas due to resonant excitation of high-amplitude Bernstein magnetoplasmons, associated with a combination of the field-concentration effect of the near field and plasmonic amplification that is resonantly enhanced in the region of Bernstein gaps. Polarization-resolved measurements further confirm the near-field origin: Bernstein resonances are insensitive to circular helicity but strongly depend on the angle of linear polarization, in sharp contrast to the cyclotron resonance response. Our results establish graphene as a platform for nonlinear magnetoplasmonics, opening opportunities for strong-field manipulation of collective electron dynamics, out-of-equilibrium electron transport, and solid-state analogues of cavity quantum electrodynamics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.25443v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Brightening of dark trions in monolayer WS$_2$ via localization of surface plasmons</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10856</link><description>arXiv:2512.10856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among all excitonic complexes in transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), dark and semi-dark trions are poised to play a stellar role in future quantum technologies due to their long lifetimes, about two orders of magnitude greater than those of their bright counterparts. In monolayer (ML) tungsten disulphide (WS$_2$), accessing these states via a suitable brightening mechanism remains challenging, specially, at elevated temperatures. Here, we demonstrate the brightening of dark trions from ML WS$_2$ over the temperature range, 83 K-115 K, enabled by localized surface plasmon modes in a disordered gold substrate. The resulting photoluminescence (PL) spectrum reveals a distinct spectral doublet with the twin peaks of semi-dark and bright trion states, separated by $\sim$ 45 meV. The origin of the semi-dark trion state lies in intervalley electron-electron scatterings, while its visibility in the PL spectrum is made possible by the enhanced out-of-plane electromagnetic field associated with plasmon localization. We also report on the negative degree of circular polarization in ML WS$_2$ at the energy of the semi-dark trion state. Our results establish a scalable plasmonic route to access valley-polarized semi-dark trions, opening new opportunities for quantum and valleytronic applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.10856v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dissociation Line and Driving Force for Nucleation of the Multiple Occupied Hydrogen Hydrate from Computer Simulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22583</link><description>arXiv:2512.22583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we determine the dissociation temperature of the hydrogen (H$_2$) hydrate by computer simulation using two different methods. In both cases, the molecules of water and H$_2$ are modeled using the TIP4P/Ice and a modified version of the Silvera and Goldman models respectively, and the Berthelot combining rule for the cross water-H$_2$ interactions has been modified. The first method used in this work is the solubility method which consists in determining the solubility of H$_2$ in an aqueous phase when in contact with a H$_2$ hydrate (H--L$_{\text{w}}$) phase and when in contact with a pure H$_2$ phase (L$_{\text{w}}$--L$_{\text{H}_2}$) at different temperatures. At a given pressure value, both solubility curves intersect at the temperature ($T_3$) at which the three phases coexist in equilibrium. Following this approach, we determine the dissociation temperature of the H$_2$ hydrate at $185\,\text{MPa}$ finding a good agreement with the data previously reported in the literature. We also analyze the effect of the multiple occupancy of the D, or small, and H, or large, cages of the sII hydrate structure. We conclude that the $T_3$ value is barely affected by the occupancy of the H$_2$ hydrate at $185\,\text{MPa}$. From the analysis of the solubility curves and performing extra bulk simulations of the three phases involved in the equilibrium, we also determine the driving force for nucleation ($\Delta\mu^{\text{EC}}_{N}$) at $185\,\text{MPa}$ as a function of the supercooling degree and the H$_2$ hydrate occupancy. We determine that, thermodynamically, the most favored occupancy of the H$_2$ hydrate consists of 1 H$_2$ molecule in the D cages and 3 in the H cages (named as 1-3 occupancy).</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22583v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Additive-Functional Approach to Transport in Periodic and Tilted Periodic Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13561</link><description>arXiv:2601.13561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this Letter, we clarify the physical origin of effective transport in periodic and tilted periodic systems. When Brownian dynamics is examined on the scale of a single period, the particle displacement admits a natural separation into a bounded part associated with recurrent motion within the periodic landscape, and an unbounded stochastic part that grows in time and carries the net transport. We show that effective drift and diffusion are governed entirely by this unbounded component, while local potential-induced fluctuations contribute only bounded corrections. Treating the displacement as an additive functional of the stochastic dynamics provides a rigorous formulation of this separation and leads to a corrector-martingale representation at the trajectory level. Within this framework, classical results-including the Lifson-Jackson formula for unbiased periodic systems and the Stratonovich expressions for tilted periodic potentials-follow as direct consequences of the same underlying structure. The same perspective extends naturally to higher-dimensional periodic environments, recovering the standard homogenized transport tensors.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13561v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Exciton-Anyon Binding in Fractional Chern Insulators: Spectral Fingerprints</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14365</link><description>arXiv:2601.14365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transition--metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) uniquely combine topological electronic states realized without external magnetic fields with a strong optical response arising from long--lived excitons. Motivated by this confluence, we investigate an interacting fermion--boson system formed by coupling an exciton to a quasihole of a fractional Chern insulator (FCI) at filling fraction $1/3$. We introduce a kagome--lattice fermion--boson model hosting an electronic FCI and a mobile exciton whose dispersion is tunable from a parabolic band to a flatband. Using exact diagonalization, we demonstrate the emergence of exciton--quasihole bound states controlled by the repulsive electron--exciton interaction $V_{\mathrm{FB}}$ and the exciton kinetic energy $t_{\mathrm{B}}$. These states appear as low--lying levels in the fermion--boson spectrum, well separated from the scattering continuum, and arise despite repulsive interactions due to a residual attraction to the local charge depletion associated with a quasihole. Reducing $t_{\mathrm{B}}$ enhances this effect by favoring interaction--dominated binding. Our results provide a model description of moir\'e TMD heterostructures, including fractional Chern insulating twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ proximitized by excitonic TMD heterobilayers, where we estimate exciton--quasihole binding energy scales of $0.6$--$1.1$~meV, placing these effects within reach of photoluminescence spectroscopy.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14365v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Adversarial Robustness Guarantees for Quantum Classifiers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10360</link><description>arXiv:2405.10360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their ever more widespread deployment throughout society, machine learning algorithms remain critically vulnerable to being spoofed by subtle adversarial tampering with their input data. The prospect of near-term quantum computers being capable of running {quantum machine learning} (QML) algorithms has therefore generated intense interest in their adversarial vulnerability. Here we show that quantum properties of QML algorithms can confer fundamental protections against such attacks, in certain scenarios guaranteeing robustness against classically-armed adversaries. We leverage tools from many-body physics to identify the quantum sources of this protection. Our results offer a theoretical underpinning of recent evidence which suggest quantum advantages in the search for adversarial robustness. In particular, we prove that quantum classifiers are: (i) protected against weak perturbations of data drawn from the trained distribution, (ii) protected against local attacks if they are insufficiently scrambling, and (iii) show evidence that they are protected against universal adversarial attacks if they are sufficiently chaotic.

Abstract: Microwave quantum memory represents a critical component for quantum radars and resource-efficient approaches to quantum error correction. Superconducting microwave resonators provide highly efficient storage, long coherence times, on-demand reading and even in memory pulse engineering, but it is still challenging to overcome design and materials induced loss channels for on-chip realization. In this work, we present a novel architecture of integrated superconducting quantum memory with a dynamically controlled RF-SQUID coupling element in pulse regime, thus ensuring high efficiency storage and cycling storage time. It demonstrates a memory cycle time of 1.51 $\mu s$ and 57.5% storage fidelity with preservation of the stored pulse shape during the retrieval at single-photon level excitations. We establish that while the proposed active coupler realization introduces no measurable fidelity degradation, the primary limitation arises from impedance matching and materials imperfections. Still the device was used only for storing finite-duration near-single-photon classical microwave pulses, we assert that it operates as a linear device when the photon population in the common resonator remains low so it should be compatible with quantum state storage.The proposed architecture highlights a disruptive potential for on-chip qubit and memory integration for scalable quantum error correction, while identifying specific avenues for near-unity storage fidelity.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.02570v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Partial projected ensembles and spatiotemporal structure of information scrambling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05632</link><description>arXiv:2508.05632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermalisation and information scrambling in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems are deeply intertwined: local subsystems dynamically approach thermal density matrices while their entropies track information spreading. Projected ensembles--ensembles of pure states conditioned on measurement outcomes of complementary subsystems--provide higher-order probes of thermalisation, converging at late times to universal maximum-entropy ensembles. In this work, we introduce the partial projected ensemble (PPE) as a framework to study how the spatiotemporal structure of scrambling is imprinted on projected ensembles. The PPE consists of an ensemble of mixed states induced on a subsystem by measurements on a spatially separated part of its complement, tracing out the remainder, naturally capturing scenarios involving discarded outcomes or noise-induced losses. We show that statistical fluctuations of the PPE faithfully track the causal lightcone of information spreading, revealing how scrambling dynamics are encoded in ensemble structure. In addition, we demonstrate that the probabilities of bit-string probabilities (PoPs) associated with the PPE exhibit distinct dynamical regimes and provide an experimentally accessible probe of scrambling. Both PPE fluctuations and PoPs display exponential sensitivity to the size of the discarded region, reflecting exponential degradation of quantum correlations under erasure. We substantiate these findings using the non-integrable kicked Ising chain, combining numerics in the ergodic regime with exact results at its self-dual point. We extend our analysis to a many-body localised (MBL) regime numerically, along with analytic results for the $\ell$-bit model. The linear and logarithmic lightcones characteristic of ergodic and MBL regimes emerge naturally from PPE dynamics, establishing it as a powerful tool for probing scrambling and deep thermalisation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.05632v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Saddle Hierarchy in Dense Associative Memory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19151</link><description>arXiv:2508.19151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dense Associative Memory (DAM) models have been attracting renewed attention since they were shown to be robust to adversarial examples and closely related to cutting edge machine learning paradigms, such as the attention mechanism and generative diffusion. We study a DAM built upon a three-layer Boltzmann machine with Potts hidden units, which represent data clusters and classes. Through a statistical mechanics analysis, we derive saddle-point equations that characterize both the stationary points of DAMs trained on real data and the fixed points of DAMs trained on synthetic data within a teacher-student framework. Based on these results, we propose a novel regularization scheme that makes training significantly more stable. Moreover, we show empirically that our DAM learns interpretable solutions to both supervised and unsupervised classification problems. Pushing our theoretical analysis further, we find that the weights learned by relatively small DAMs correspond to unstable saddle points in larger DAMs. We implement a network-growing algorithm that leverages this saddle-point hierarchy to drastically reduce the computational cost of training dense associative memory.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.19151v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum Entanglement as a Cohomological Obstruction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04326</link><description>arXiv:2511.04326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We recast quantum entanglement as a cohomological obstruction to reconstructing a global quantum state from locally compatible information. We address this by considering presheaf cohomologies of states and entanglement witnesses. Sheafification erases the global-from-local signature while leaving within-patch multipartite structure, captured by local entanglement groups introduced here. For smooth parameter families, the obstruction admits a differential-geometric representative obtained by pairing an appropriate witness field with the curvature of a natural unitary connection on the associated bundle of amplitudes. We also introduce a Quantum Entanglement Index (QEI) as an index-theoretic invariant of entangled states and explain its behavior. Finally, we outline a theoretical physics approach to probe these ideas in quantum many-body systems and suggest a possible entanglement-induced correction as an experimental validation. Detailed numerical implementations for concrete quantum many-body models are presented in the companion paper \cite{2026arXiv260113467I}.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.04326v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] SPADE: A SIMD Posit-enabled compute engine for Accelerating DNN Efficiency</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17279</link><description>arXiv:2601.17279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for edge-AI systems requires arithmetic units that balance numerical precision, energy efficiency, and compact hardware while supporting diverse formats. Posit arithmetic offers advantages over floating- and fixed-point representations through its tapered precision, wide dynamic range, and improved numerical robustness. This work presents SPADE, a unified multi-precision SIMD Posit-based multiplyaccumulate (MAC) architecture supporting Posit (8,0), Posit (16,1), and Posit (32,2) within a single framework. Unlike prior single-precision or floating/fixed-point SIMD MACs, SPADE introduces a regime-aware, lane-fused SIMD Posit datapath that hierarchically reuses Posit-specific submodules (LOD, complementor, shifter, and multiplier) across 8/16/32-bit precisions without datapath replication. FPGA implementation on a Xilinx Virtex-7 shows 45.13% LUT and 80% slice reduction for Posit (8,0), and up to 28.44% and 17.47% improvement for Posit (16,1) and Posit (32,2) over prior work, with only 6.9% LUT and 14.9% register overhead for multi-precision support. ASIC results across TSMC nodes achieve 1.38 GHz at 6.1 mW (28 nm). Evaluation on MNIST, CIFAR-10/100, and alphabet datasets confirms competitive inference accuracy.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17279v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Memory-Efficient FPGA Implementation of Stochastic Simulated Annealing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18007</link><description>arXiv:2601.18007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulated annealing (SA) is a well-known algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. However, the computation time of SA increases rapidly, as the size of the problem grows. Recently, a stochastic simulated annealing (SSA) algorithm that converges faster than conventional SA has been reported. In this paper, we present a hardware-aware SSA (HA- SSA) algorithm for memory-efficient FPGA implementations. HA-SSA can reduce the memory usage of storing intermediate results while maintaining the computing speed of SSA. For evaluation purposes, the proposed algorithm is compared with the conventional SSA and SA approaches on maximum cut combinatorial optimization problems. HA-SSA achieves a convergence speed that is up to 114-times faster than that of the conventional SA algorithm depending on the maximum cut problem selected from the G-set which is a dataset of the maximum cut problems. HA-SSA is implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) (Xilinx Kintex-7), and it achieves up to 6-times the memory efficiency of conventional SSA while maintaining high solution quality for optimization problems.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18007v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Real-Time, Energy-Efficient, Sampling-Based Optimal Control via FPGA Acceleration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17231</link><description>arXiv:2601.17231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), used for search-and-rescue and remote exploration, require fast and robust planning and control schemes. Sampling-based approaches for Model Predictive Control, especially approaches based on the Model Predictive Path Integral Control (MPPI) algorithm, have recently proven both to be highly effective for such applications and to map naturally to GPUs for hardware acceleration. However, both GPU and CPU implementations of such algorithms can struggle to meet tight energy and latency budgets on battery-constrained AMR platforms that leverage embedded compute. To address this issue, we present an FPGA-optimized MPPI design that exposes fine-grained parallelism and eliminates synchronization bottlenecks via deep pipelining and parallelism across algorithmic stages. This results in an average 3.1x to 7.5x speedup over optimized implementations on an embedded GPU and CPU, respectively, while simultaneously achieving a 2.5x to 5.4x reduction in energy usage. These results demonstrate that FPGA architectures are a promising direction for energy-efficient and high-performance edge robotics.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17231v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] @NTT: Algorithm-Targeted NTT hardware acceleration via Design-Time Constant Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17806</link><description>arXiv:2601.17806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) is a critical computational bottleneck in many lattice-based postquantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms. By leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm, the NTT of a polynomial of degree N - 1 can be computed with a time complexity of O(N log N). Hardware implementation of NTT is generally preferred over software ones, as the latter are significantly slower due to complex memory access patterns and modular arithmetic operations. Achieving maximum throughput in hardware, however, typically demands a prohibitively large number of butterfly unit instantiations. In this work, we propose @NTT, which exploits the fact that the ring parameters in these algorithms are fixed, enabling design-time constant optimization and achieving the maximum throughput of N-point NTT per clock cycle with a compact hardware footprint. Our case study on the Dilithium NTT, implemented using the TSMC 28 nm library, operates at a clock frequency of 1.0 GHz with an area of 1.45 mm^2. On FPGA, the design achieves a throughput-per-LUT that is 5.2x higher than the state-of-the-art implementation.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17806v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] MetaML-Pro: Cross-Stage Design Flow Automation for Efficient Deep Learning Acceleration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05850</link><description>arXiv:2502.05850v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework for codifying and automating optimization strategies to efficiently deploy deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained hardware, such as FPGAs, while maintaining high performance, accuracy, and resource efficiency. Deploying DNNs on such platforms involves addressing the significant challenge of balancing performance, resource usage (e.g., DSPs and LUTs), and inference accuracy, which often requires extensive manual effort and domain expertise. Our novel approach addresses two core key issues: (i)~encoding custom optimization strategies and (ii)~enabling cross-stage optimization search. In particular, our proposed framework seamlessly integrates programmatic DNN optimization techniques with high-level synthesis (HLS)-based metaprogramming, leveraging advanced design space exploration (DSE) strategies like Bayesian optimization to automate both top-down and bottom-up design flows. Hence, we reduce the need for manual intervention and domain expertise. In addition, the framework introduces customizable optimization, transformation, and control blocks to enhance DNN accelerator performance and resource efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate up to a 92\% DSP and 89\% LUT usage reduction for select networks, while preserving accuracy, along with a 15.6-fold reduction in optimization time compared to grid search. These results highlight the potential for automating the generation of resource-efficient DNN accelerator designs with minimum effort.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.05850v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] VeriRAG: A Retrieval-Augmented Framework for Automated RTL Testability Repair</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15664</link><description>arXiv:2507.15664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense potential in computer-aided design (CAD), particularly for automated debugging and verification within electronic design automation (EDA) tools. However, Design for Testability (DFT) remains a relatively underexplored area. This paper presents VeriRAG, the first LLM-assisted DFT-EDA framework. VeriRAG leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to enable LLM to revise code to ensure DFT compliance. VeriRAG integrates (1) an autoencoder-based similarity measurement model for precise retrieval of reference RTL designs for the LLM, and (2) an iterative code revision pipeline that allows the LLM to ensure DFT compliance while maintaining synthesizability. To support VeriRAG, we introduce VeriDFT, a Verilog-based DFT dataset curated for DFT-aware RTL repairs. VeriRAG retrieves structurally similar RTL designs from VeriDFT, each paired with a rigorously validated correction, as references for code repair. With VeriRAG and VeriDFT, we achieve fully automated DFT correction -- resulting in a 7.72-fold improvement in successful repair rate compared to the zero-shot baseline (Fig. 5 in Section V). Ablation studies further confirm the contribution of each component of the VeriRAG framework.

Abstract: Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) have emerged as a powerful tool for secure and privacy-preserving computation. ZKPs enable one party to convince another of a statement's validity without revealing anything else. This capability has profound implications in many domains, including machine learning, blockchain, image authentication, and electronic voting. Despite their potential, ZKPs have seen limited deployment because of their exceptionally high computational overhead, which manifests primarily during proof generation. To mitigate these overheads, a (growing) body of researchers has proposed hardware accelerators and GPU implementations of both kernels and complete protocols. Prior art spans a wide variety of ZKP schemes that vary significantly in computational overhead, proof size, verifier cost, protocol setup, and trust. The latest and widely used ZKP protocols are intentionally designed to balance these trade-offs. One particular challenge in modern ZKP systems is supporting complex, high-degree gates using the SumCheck protocol. We address this challenge with a novel programmable accelerator to efficiently handle arbitrary custom gates via SumCheck. Our accelerator achieves upwards of $1000\times$ geomean speedup over CPU-based SumChecks across a range of gate types. We include this unit in zkPHIRE, a programmable, full-system accelerator that accelerates the HyperPlonk protocol. zkPHIRE achieves $1486\times$ geomean speedup over CPU and $11.87\times$ geomean speedup over the state-of-the-art at iso-area. Together, these results demonstrate compelling performance while scaling to large problem sizes (upwards of $2^{30}$ constraints) and maintaining small proof sizes ($4-5$ KB).</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.16738v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Parameterized Hardware Design with Latency-Abstract Interfaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02570</link><description>arXiv:2401.02570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hardware designs must use latency-insensitive (LI) interfaces when timing is input-dependent. When timing is input-independent, designs should use latency-sensitive (LS) interfaces for maximum performance. However, designs commonly use LI interfaces to integrate with externally generated LS modules--from, e.g., IP generators, high-level synthesis, or domain specific languages. In every fully integrated design, such uses of LI represent pure overhead. The challenge is that generators can dramatically change timing interfaces of the modules to meet performance objectives, and LI interfaces act as a useful design abstraction and enable timing adaptation.
  We define latency-abstract (LA) interfaces, a new design abstraction, which provide the timing adaptability of LI interfaces at design-time and the efficient integration of LS interfaces. LA interfaces use output parameters, a novel compile-time mechanism for child modules to return values parent modules, to abstract and encapsulate timing behaviors at design time. During design elaboration, LA interfaces are compiled into efficient LS interfaces based on parameter values. While an attractive option, LA interfaces inherit the complexities of parameterized hardware design: the user must reason how parameters influence timing behaviors of modules and ensure that designs adapt to interface changes. To address this challenge and demonstrate the utility of LA interfaces, we design Lilac, a parameterized HDL that uses a type system track the influence of parameters on timing behaviors and formally guarantee that every parameterization of an LA design results in a circuit without structural hazards.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2401.02570v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Confidential Computing on Heterogeneous CPU-GPU Systems: Survey and Future Directions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11601</link><description>arXiv:2408.11601v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the widespread informatization and rapid data explosion have increased the demand for high-performance heterogeneous systems that integrate multiple computing cores such as CPUs, Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The combination of CPU and GPU is particularly popular due to its versatility. However, these heterogeneous systems face significant security and privacy risks. Advances in privacy-preserving techniques, especially hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), offer effective protection for GPU applications. Nonetheless, the potential security risks involved in extending TEEs to GPUs in heterogeneous systems remain uncertain and need further investigation. To investigate these risks in depth, we study the existing popular GPU TEE designs and summarize and compare their key implications. Additionally, we review existing powerful attacks on GPUs and traditional TEEs deployed on CPUs, along with the efforts to mitigate these threats. We identify potential attack surfaces introduced by GPU TEEs and provide insights into key considerations for designing secure GPU TEEs. This survey is timely as new TEEs for heterogeneous systems, particularly GPUs, are being developed, highlighting the need to understand potential security threats and build both efficient and secure systems.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2408.11601v3</guid></item><item><title>[Nature] Social-media bans: why corporate fines could backfire</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00262-z</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature, Published online: 27 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00262-z"&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-026-00262-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Social-media bans: why corporate fines could backfire</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00262-z</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Oligoprotein type I interferon signatures, but not &lt;i&gt;TREX1&lt;/i&gt; variants, increase risk of systemic lupus erythematosus in UK Biobank</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67832-z</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 27 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67832-z"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-025-67832-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Genetic variants of TREX1, a negative regulator of type I interferon responses, have been linked previously to non-monogenic systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Mutations in YIPF5 cause MEDS2 (microcephaly, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes syndrome), a fatal disorder manifesting in early childhood. We demonstrate that YIPF5 is involved in ER export of a subset of proteins, including cargoes of the ER-export receptor SURF4, with which it directly interacts. YIPF5 knockout cells display altered cell surface and secretome profiles, with reduced neuronal adhesion molecules and increased secretion of ER chaperones affecting migration.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00166-5?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] ToPolyAgent: AI Agents for Coarse-Grained Bead-Spring Topological Polymer Simulations</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00471C</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, Accepted Manuscript&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00471C, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Lijie Ding, Jan Michael Y.

Following MI, the heart undergoes remodelling leading to heart failure. The Hippo pathway is a major regulator of cell growth and survival in cardiomyocytes. Here we show that serotonin receptor 2B (5-HT2B) regulates Hippo pathway in cardiomyocytes and modulates heart remodelling following MI. 5-HT2B expression significantly enhanced the Hippo pathway effector Yes-associated protein (YAP) activity resulting in increased cardiomyocyte proliferation and decreased apoptosis.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00200-2?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Protective role of PASH-1 in CGG repeat-driven RNA and protein toxicity in FXTAS</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00187-2?rss=yes</link><description>Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is caused by CGG repeat expansions in FMR1, leading to RNA toxicity and toxic FMRpolyG peptide from abnormal translation. Using a Caenorhabditis elegans model, we generated single-copy insertions of the human FMR1 5’ UTR containing 0, 16, or 99 CGG repeats under a pan-neuronal promoter. Worms expressing 99 CGG repeats showed impaired motility, altered neuronal morphology, and disrupted miRNA homeostasis. Co-expression of PASH-1, the C. elegans ortholog of a miRNA-processing DGCR8 sequestered in FXTAS, mitigated both RNA- and peptide-mediated toxicity, restoring locomotion, neuronal structure, and miRNA regulation balance.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00187-2?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Cord Serum Metabolic Signatures Associated with Neonatal Anthropometry and Neurodevelopment Through Age Two in Twins</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00184-7?rss=yes</link><description>Conventional singleton studies struggle to disentangle environmental from genetic influences on phenotypes. This twin study (n=129 pairs) leveraged within-pair comparisons to clarify these influences on early development. At the population level, we identified 130 cord serum metabolites associated with neonatal anthropometry and neurodevelopment up to 24 months. Monozygotic and dizygotic comparisons showed that metabolite associations with fetal growth measures (e.g., birth weight) were genetically influenced, whereas links to 6-month fine motor skills reflected non-shared intrauterine factors, especially unequal placental sharing.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00184-7?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Robust effector memory features of human T-bethi B cells induced by repeated mRNA vaccination</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00179-3?rss=yes</link><description>The heterogeneity of memory B cells in response to repetitive cognate antigen challenges remains to be fully elucidated. Here we identified a transcriptionally distinct cluster of T-bethi B cells, among SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific B cells in PBMCs from healthy individuals vaccinated with the BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. Our findings indicate that T-bethi B cells can be defined by a combination of CD11c and FcRL5 receptors, and are distinguished by distinct gene regulatory networks associated with effector

Abstract: Magnetic topological materials are a class of compounds which can host massless electrons controlled by the magnetic order. One such compound is EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$, which has recently garnered interest due to its strong interplay between the Eu magnetism and charge carriers. However the topology of the electronic band structure, which depends on the ground state magnetic configuration of the europium sublattice, has not been determined. Based on our \textit{ab-initio} calculations, we find that an in-plane and out-of-plane \textit{A}-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) order generates a topological crystalline insulator and Dirac semimetal respectively, whereas a ferromagnetic (FM) order stabilizes a Weyl semimetal. Our resonant x-ray elastic scattering measurements of single-crystal thin film EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$ reveal both a sharp magnetic peak at $\textit{\textbf{Q}}$=$(0,0,\frac{1}{2})$ and broad $\textit{\textbf{Q}}$=$(0,0,1)$ below $T_{\mathrm{N}}=12.9$\,K, which is associated with an \textit{A}-type AFM and FM order, respectively. Our measurements indicate that the FM and AFM layers are spatially separated along the crystal $c$ axis, with the former limited to the top three atomic layers. We propose that EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$ behaves as a Weyl semimetal in the surface FM layers, and as a topological crystalline insulator in the lower AFM layers.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16365v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Photoinduced metastable cation disorder in metal halide double perovskites</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16404</link><description>arXiv:2601.16404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead-free perovskites have emerged as environmentally benign alternatives to lead-halide counterparts for optoelectronics. Among them, the double perovskite Cs2AgInCl6 family exhibits remarkable white-light emission with proper composition engineering, enabled by strong electron-phonon coupling and the formation of self-trapped excitons (STEs). Despite these advantages, the fundamental photo- and structural dynamics governing their excited-state behavior remain poorly understood. Here, we report a long-lived metastable phase in the Cs2AgInCl6 double perovskite family and unravel this process and the concomitant electronic and structural evolution using a suite of tools including transient optical spectroscopy, time-resolved X-ray diffraction (TR-XRD) and X-ray absorption (TR-XAS). We show that the photoinduced, transient metastable phase is associated with B-site (Ag-In) disorder, which induces a dramatically reduced optical bandgap. Supported by TR-XRD and first-principles calculations, the Ag-In disorder drives the formation of Ag-rich and In-rich domains with millisecond lifetimes, with lifetimes increasing at lower temperatures. TR-XAS further reveals that photogenerated STEs oxidize Ag+ to Ag2+, facilitating this highly temporally asymmetric order-disorder transition. Our findings demonstrate a new mechanism, mediated by hole-localized STE formation, that enables prolongation of transient light-induced states to the multi-millisecond regime in double perovskites, opening possibilities to harvesting the functional properties of metastable phases of these materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16404v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Distinguishing Hot-Electron and Optomechanical Pathways at Metal-Molecule Interfaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16445</link><description>arXiv:2601.16445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy and charge transfer between molecules and metal surfaces underpin heterogeneous catalysis, surface-enhanced spectroscopies and plasmon-driven chemistry, yet the microscopic origins of vibrational excitation at metal interfaces remain unresolved. Here we use temperature-dependent surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) to directly distinguish plasmon-vibration optomechanical coupling from hot-electron-driven excitation.By probing thionine adsorbed on gold nanostructures at 295 K and 3.5 K, we show that pronounced anti-Stokes scattering at cryogenic temperature arises from optical pumping of vibrational populations, whereas room-temperature spectra are governed by thermal population. Bromide co-adsorbates play a decisive role by guiding molecular alignment, inducing surface atom displacements, and enabling transient adsorption geometries that activate otherwise Raman-inactive vibrational modes. In the absence of bromide, distinct excitation pathways emerge, reflecting competition between optomechanical coupling and charge-transfer processes associated with molecular polarization along the optical field or orientation relative to the metal surface. These results establish molecular optomechanics as a sensitive probe of surface-molecule interactions and demonstrate how anion-mediated surface dynamics regulate energy flow at plasmonic interfaces.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16445v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A low-tech solution to process entire metal/molecule heterostructure stacks into vertical nanopillar electronic devices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16481</link><description>arXiv:2601.16481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum technologies aim to assemble devices whose operation is controlled by the quantum state of individual atoms. Achieving this level of control in a practical, scalable design remains, however, a major obstacle to mass societal adoption. By working at the level of interatomic bonding, molecular engineering has enabled exquisite control over the electronic properties of individual atoms and their interactions with neighboring atoms. This positions molecular electronics as a potentially disruptive quantum technology, but serious technological challenges have prevented it from being included in technical road maps. The main obstacle is that conventional, mass scalable nanodevice technologies utilize resists and solvents that can degrade molecules. Some approaches involve exposing junction interfaces to contaminants (e.g. air, resist etc...), which can be particularly problematic for spintronics. In this technical paper, we present our decade-long work into building a nanotechnological chain that can process entire metal/molecule heterostructures into vertical nanopillars electronic devices. We discuss the advantages and pitfalls of the various iterations of this process that were implemented. We also discuss outlooks for this unique technology.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16481v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Electronic structure, phase stability, and transport properties of the AlTiVCr lightweight high-entropy alloy: A computational study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16528</link><description>arXiv:2601.16528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics and phase stability of the AlTiVCr lightweight high-entropy alloy using a combination of ab initio electronic structure calculations, a concentration wave analysis, and atomistic Monte Carlo simulations. In alignment both with experimental data and with results obtained using other computational approaches, we predict a $\textrm{B2}$ (CsCl) chemical ordering emerging in this alloy at comparatively high temperatures, which is driven by Al and Ti moving to separate sublattices, while V and Cr express weaker site preferences. The impact of this $\textrm{B2}$ chemical ordering on the electronic transport properties of the alloy is investigated within a Kubo-Greenwood linear response framework and it is found that, counter-intuitively, the alloy's residual resistivity increases as the material transitions from the $\textrm{A2}$ (disordered bcc) phase to our predicted $\textrm{B2}$ (partially) ordered structure. This is understood to result primarily from a reduction in the density of electronic states at the Fermi level induced by the chemical ordering. At low temperatures, our atomistic Monte Carlo simulations then reveal subsequent sublattice orderings, with the ground-state configuration predicted to be a fully-ordered, single-phase structure with vanishing associated residual resistivity. These results give fresh, insight into the atomic-scale structure and consequent physical properties of this well-studied, technologically relevant material.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16528v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Synergistic effects of ferromagnetic elements and LAGP solid electrolyte in suppressing and trapping polysulfide shuttle transfers in lithium-sulfur batteries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16544</link><description>arXiv:2601.16544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large - scale commercialization of promising lithium - sulfur (Li - S) batteries remains limited by the polysulfide shuttle effect, which causes rapid capacity fading and poor cycle life. In this study, we present a scalable strategy to mitigate this challenge by modifying polyethylene (PE) separators with ferromagnetic and solid - state ionic coatings. Thin films of nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), and the Li - ion - conducting ceramic Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 (LAGP) were deposited via ion beam sputtering, while Ni ion implantation was also employed to modify the PE substrate. The electrochemical performance of pristine and modified separators was evaluated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and staircase voltammetry (SV) in liquid electrolyte within H - cell configurations. Surface morphology and elemental composition were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS). The results show that LAGP-based coatings significantly enhance separator stability and effectively suppress polysulfide diffusion, leading to lower redox peak intensities and improved cycling performance. In contrast, Ni coatings exhibited poor long - term stability, likely due to parasitic reactions or delamination during its life time. The combined LAGP/Co architecture provided the most effective suppression of the polysulfide shuttle, attributed to synergistic ionic and catalytic effects that promote interfacial stability and selective ion transport.

Abstract: Carbon dioxide hydrates are ice-like nonstoichiometric inclusion solid compounds with importance to global climate change, and gas transportation and storage. The thermodynamic and kinetic mechanisms that control carbon dioxide nucleation critically depend on hydrate-water interfacial free energy. Interfacial energies show large uncertainties due to the conditions at which experiments are performed. Under these circumstances, we hypothesize that accurate molecular models for water and carbon dioxide combined with computer simulation tools can offer an alternative but complementary way to estimate interfacial energies at coexistence conditions from a molecular perspective. We have evaluated the interfacial free energy of carbon dioxide hydrates at coexistence conditions (three-phase equilibrium or dissociation line) implementing advanced computational methodologies, including the novel Mold Integration methodology. Our calculations are based on the definition of the interfacial free energy, standard statistical thermodynamic techniques, and the use of the most reliable and used molecular models for water (TIP4P/Ice) and carbon dioxide (TraPPE) available in the literature. We find that simulations provide an interfacial energy value, at coexistence conditions, consistent with the experiments from its thermodynamic definition. Our calculations are reliable since are based on the use of two molecular models that accurately predict: (1) The ice-water interfacial free energy; and (2) the dissociation line of carbon dioxide hydrates. Computer simulation predictions provide alternative but reliable estimates of the carbon dioxide interfacial energy. Our pioneering work demonstrates that is possible to predict interfacial energies of hydrates from a truly computational molecular perspective and opens a new door to the determination of free energies of hydrates.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16653v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Doping-dependent orbital magnetism in Chromium pnictides</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16908</link><description>arXiv:2601.16908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results for the phase diagram of the parent compound LaCrAsO under electron doping using the matrix random-phase approximation. At low doping levels, the system stabilizes an antiferromagnetic state in which different Cr sublattices carry opposite spins, consistent with experimental observations. As the doping concentration increases, a stripe-type antiferromagnetic phase becomes favored. At even higher doping, the system repeats the two former magnetic states, but with incommensurate magnetic ordering vectors. The commensurate magnetic phases are associated with more localized electrons in the Cr $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital, whereas the incommensurate phases are linked to the $d_{xy}$ orbital, whose stronger overlap favors itinerant-electron magnetism.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16908v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Fractional Order Thermo Piezoelectric Modelling of qP Wave Interaction and Energy Partition at Welded Interface</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16223</link><description>arXiv:2601.16223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An analytical model is developed to investigate the interaction of quasi longitudinal (qP) waves with a perfectly bonded interface between a thermo piezoelectric half space and a functionally graded piezoelectric half space. The formulation is based on the fractional order Lord Shulman generalized thermoelasticity theory, which provides an enhanced description of coupled thermo electro mechanical wave behaviour. Rotational effects are incorporated into the constitutive relations and equations of motion for both media, while the lower half space is assumed to be subjected to initial stress. Closed form solutions for reflection and transmission coefficients are obtained, together with associated energy partition factors, allowing a comprehensive assessment of interface wave characteristics. Numerical simulations carried out using MATLAB demonstrate that the reflection and transmission responses are strongly influenced by initial stress, fractional order parameter, and thermal relaxation time. The calculated energy ratios of scattered waves satisfy the energy conservation condition, confirming the mathematical consistency of the formulation. The findings of this study are relevant to the design and analysis of smart sensors, rotating and aerospace structures, vibration control systems, and energy harvesting devices employing functionally graded thermo piezoelectric materials under fractional order effects.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16223v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] D-MODD: A Diffusion Model of Opinion Dynamics Derived from Online Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16226</link><description>arXiv:2601.16226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first empirical derivation of a continuous-time stochastic model for real-world opinion dynamics. Using longitudinal social-media data to infer users opinion on a binary climate-change topic, we reconstruct the underlying drift and diffusion functions governing individual opinion updates. We show that the observed dynamics are well described by a Langevin-type stochastic differential equation, with persistent attractor basins and spatially sensitive drift and diffusion terms. The empirically inferred one-step transition probabilities closely reproduce the transition kernel generated from the D-MODD model we introduce. Our results provide the first direct evidence that online opinion dynamics on a polarized topic admit a Markovian description at the operator level, with empirically reconstructed transition kernels accurately reproduced by a data-driven Langevin model, bridging sociophysics, behavioral data, and complex-systems modeling.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16226v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Experimental observation of conformal field theory spectra</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16275</link><description>arXiv:2601.16275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal field theories (CFTs) feature prominently in high-energy physics, statistical mechanics, and condensed matter. For example, CFTs govern emergent universal properties of systems tuned to quantum phase transitions, including their entanglement, correlations, and low-energy excitation spectra. Much of the rich structure predicted by CFTs nevertheless remains unobserved in experiment. Here we directly observe the energy excitation spectra of emergent CFTs at quantum phase transitions -- recovering universal energy ratios characteristic of the underlying field theories. Specifically, we develop and implement a modulation technique to resolve a Rydberg chain's finite-size spectra, variably tuned to quantum phase transitions described by either Ising or tricritical Ising CFTs. We also employ local control to distinguish parities of excitations under reflection and, in the tricritical Ising chain, to induce transitions between distinct CFT spectra associated with changing boundary conditions. By utilizing a variant of the modulation technique, we furthermore study the dynamical structure factor of the critical system, which is closely related to the correlation of an underlying Ising conformal field. Our work not only probes the emergence of CFT features in a quantum simulator, but also provides a technique for diagnosing a priori unknown universality classes in future experiments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16275v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Valley-dependent topological interface states in biased armchair nanoribbons of gapless single-layer graphene for transport applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05653</link><description>arXiv:2510.05653v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Valley-dependent topological physics offers a promising avenue for designing nanoscale devices based on gapless single-layer graphene. To demonstrate this potential, we investigate an electrical bias-controlled topological discontinuity in valley polarization within a two-segment armchair nanoribbon of gapless single-layer graphene. This discontinuity is created at the interface by applying opposite in-plane, transverse electrical biases to the two segments. An efficient tight-binding theoretical formulation is developed to calculate electron states in the structure. In a reference configuration, we obtain energy eigenvalues and probability distributions that feature interface-confined electron eigenstates induced by the topological discontinuity. Moreover, to elucidate the implications of interface confinement for electron transport, a modified configuration is introduced to transform the eigenstates into transport-active, quasi-localized ones. We show that such states result in Fano "anti-resonances" in transmission spectra. The resilience of these quasi-localized states and their associated Fano fingerprints is examined with respect to fluctuations. Finally, a proof-of-concept band-stop electron energy filter is presented, highlighting the potential of this confinement mechanism and, more broadly, valley-dependent topological physics in designing nanoscale devices in gapless single-layer graphene.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.05653v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Finite-temperature topological transitions in the presence of quenched uncorrelated disorder</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12001</link><description>arXiv:2601.12001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address issues related to the presence of defects at finite-temperature topological transitions, in particular when defects are modeled in terms of further variables associated with a quenched disorder, corresponding to the limit in which the defect dynamics is very slow. As a paradigmatic model, we consider the classical three-dimensional lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge model in the presence of quenched uncorrelated disorder associated with the plaquettes of the lattice, whose topological transitions are characterized by the absence of a local order parameter. We study the critical behaviors in the presence of weak disorder. We show that they belong to a new topological universality class, different from that of the lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge models without disorder, in agreement with the Harris criterium for the relevance of uncorrelated quenched disorder when the pure system undergoes a continuous transition with positive specific-heat critical exponent.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12001v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Integral Transforms for Finite Gauge Theory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00117</link><description>arXiv:2312.00117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper shows that quantization of $\pi$-finite spaces, as a functor out of a higher category of spans, is equivariant in two ways: Symmetries of a given polarization/Lagrangian always induce coherent symmetries of the quantization. On the other hand, symmetries of the entire phase space a priori only induce projective symmetries, with an invertible once-categorified theory, the anomaly theory, encoding the projectivity.
  We give projective symmetries of three-dimensional finite gauge theories a concrete description via a twice-categorified analogue of Blattner-Kostant-Sternberg kernels and the associated integral transforms, such as the Fourier transform. This establishes an analogy between certain instances of the $\pi$-finite quantization procedure considered herein and the geometric quantization of a symplectic vector space.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2312.00117v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Disentangling Boltzmann brains, the time-asymmetry of memory, and the second law</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10959</link><description>arXiv:2507.10959v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Are your perceptions, memories and observational data, a statistical fluctuation out of the thermal equilibrium of the universe, having no correlation with the actual past state of the universe? Arguments are given in the literature for and against this "Boltzmann brain" hypothesis. Complicating these arguments have been the many subtle -- and very often implicit -- joint dependencies among these arguments and others that have been given for the past hypothesis, the second law, and even for Bayesian inference of the reliability of experimental data. These dependencies can easily lead to circular reasoning. To avoid this problem, since all of these arguments involve the stochastic properties of the dynamics of the universe's entropy, we begin by formalizing that dynamics as a time-symmetric, time-translation invariant Markov process, which we call the entropy conjecture. Crucially, like all stochastic processes, the entropy conjecture does not specify any time(s) which it should be conditioned on in order to infer the stochastic dynamics of our universe's entropy. Any such choice of conditioning times and associated entropy values must be introduced as an independent assumption. This observation allows us to disentangle the standard Boltzmann brain hypothesis, its "1000CE" variant, the past hypothesis, the second law, and the reliability of our experimental data, all in a fully formal manner. In particular, we show that these all make an arbitrary assumption that the dynamics of the universe's entropy should be conditioned on a single event at a single moment in time, differing only in the details of their assumptions. In this aspect, the Boltzmann brain hypothesis and the second law are equally legitimate (or not).</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.10959v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Information Propagation in Predator-Prey Dynamics of Turbulent Plasma</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05127</link><description>arXiv:2508.05127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetically confined fusion plasmas exhibit predator-prey-like cyclic oscillations through the self-regulating interaction between drift-wave turbulence and zonal flow. To elucidate the detailed mechanism and causality underlying this phenomenon, we construct a simple stochastic predator-prey model that incorporates intrinsic fluctuations and analyze its statistical properties from an information-theoretic perspective. We first show that the model exhibits persistent fluctuating cyclic oscillations called quasi-cycles due to amplification of intrinsic noise. This result suggests the possibility that the previously observed periodic oscillations in a toroidal plasma are not limit cycles but quasi-cycles, and that such quasi-cycles may be widely observed under various conditions. For this model, we further prove that information of the zonal flow is propagated to turbulence. This result suggests that turbulence behavior may be predictable to a certain extent based on zonal flow characteristics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.05127v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Geometric Categories for Continuous Gauging</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08254</link><description>arXiv:2511.08254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified categorical framework for gauging both continuous and finite symmetries in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. Our construction applies to geometric categories i.e. categories internal to stacks. This generalizes the familiar setting of fusion categories, which describe finite group symmetries, to the case of Lie group symmetries. Within this framework, we obtain a functorial Symmetry Topological Field Theory together with its natural boundaries, allowing us to compute associated endomorphism categories and Drinfeld centers in a uniform way. For a given symmetry group $G$, our framework recovers the electric and magnetic higher-form symmetries expected in $G$-gauge theory. Moreover, it naturally encodes electric breaking symmetry in the presence of charged matter, reproducing known physical phenomena in a categorical setting.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.08254v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] A High Performance and Efficient Post-Quantum Crypto-Processor for FrodoKEM</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16500</link><description>arXiv:2601.16500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: FrodoKEM is a lattice-based post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism (KEM). It has been considered for standardization by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) due to its robust security profile. However, its hardware implementation exhibits a weakness of high latency and heavy resource burden, hindering its practical application. Moreover, diverse usage scenarios call for comprehensive functionality. To address these challenges, this paper presents a high-performance and efficient crypto-processor for FrodoKEM. A multiple-instruction overlapped execution scheme is introduced to enable efficient multi-module scheduling and minimize operational latency. Furthermore, a high-speed, reconfigurable parallel multiplier array is integrated to handle intensive matrix computations under diverse computation patterns, significantly enhancing hardware efficiency. In addition, a compact memory scheduling strategy shortens the lifespan of intermediate matrices, thereby reducing overall storage requirements. The proposed design provides full support for all FrodoKEM security levels and protocol phases. It consumes 13467 LUTs, 6042 FFs, and 14 BRAMs on an Artix-7 FPGA and achieves the fastest reported execution time. Compared with state-of-the-art hardware implementations, our design improves the area-time product (ATP) by 1.75-2.00 times.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16500v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] SAGe: A Lightweight Algorithm-Architecture Co-Design for Mitigating the Data Preparation Bottleneck in Large-Scale Genome Sequence Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03732</link><description>arXiv:2504.03732v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Genome sequence analysis, which examines the DNA sequences of organisms, drives advances in many critical medical and biotechnological fields. Given its importance and the exponentially growing volumes of genomic sequence data, there are extensive efforts to accelerate genome sequence analysis. In this work, we demonstrate a major bottleneck that greatly limits and diminishes the benefits of state-of-the-art genome sequence analysis accelerators: the data preparation bottleneck, where genomic sequence data is stored in compressed form and needs to be first decompressed and formatted before an accelerator can operate on it. To mitigate this bottleneck, we propose SAGe, an algorithm-architecture co-design for highly-compressed storage and high-performance access of large-scale genomic sequence data. The key challenge is to improve data preparation performance while maintaining high compression ratios (comparable to genomic-specific compression algorithms) at low hardware cost. We address this challenge by leveraging key properties of genomic datasets to co-design (i) a lossless (de)compression algorithm, (ii) hardware that decompresses data with lightweight operations and efficient streaming accesses, (iii) storage data layout, and (iv) interface commands to access data. SAGe is highly versatile, as it supports datasets from different sequencing technologies and species. Due to its lightweight design, SAGe can be seamlessly integrated with a broad range of hardware accelerators for genome sequence analysis to mitigate their data preparation bottlenecks. Our results demonstrate that SAGe improves the average end-to-end performance and energy efficiency of two state-of-the-art genome sequence analysis accelerators by 3.0x-32.1x and 13.0x-34.0x, respectively, compared to when the accelerators rely on state-of-the-art software and hardware decompression tools.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.03732v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] LaZagna: An Open-Source Framework for Flexible 3D FPGA Architectural Exploration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05579</link><description>arXiv:2505.05579v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While 3D IC technology has been extensively explored for ASICs, their application to FPGAs remains limited. Existing studies on 3D FPGAs are often constrained to fixed prototypes, narrow architectural templates, and simulation-only evaluations. In this work, we present LaZagna, the first open-source framework for automated, end-to-end 3D FPGA architecture generation and evaluation. LaZagna supports high-level architectural specification, synthesizable RTL generation, and bitstream production, enabling comprehensive validation of 3D FPGA designs beyond simulation. It significantly broadens the design space compared to prior work by introducing customizable vertical interconnect patterns, novel 3D switch block designs, and support for heterogeneous logic layers. The framework also incorporates practical design constraints such as inter-layer via density and vertical interconnect delay. We demonstrate the capabilities of LaZagna by generating synthesizable RTL that can be taken through full physical design flows for fabric generation, along with functionally correct bitstreams. Furthermore, we conduct five case studies that explore various architectural parameters and evaluate their impact on wirelength, critical path delay, and routing runtime. These studies showcase the framework's scalability, flexibility, and effectiveness in guiding future 3D FPGA architectural and packaging decisions. LaZagna is fully open-source and available on GitHub.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.05579v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Relational Hoare Logic for High-Level Synthesis of Hardware Accelerators</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09217</link><description>arXiv:2601.09217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-level synthesis (HLS) is a powerful tool for developing efficient hardware accelerators that rely on specialized memory systems to achieve sufficient on-chip data reuse and off-chip bandwidth utilization. However, even with HLS, designing such systems still requires careful manual tuning, as automatic optimizations provided by existing tools are highly sensitive to programming style and often lack transparency. To address these issues, we present a formal translation framework based on relational Hoare logic, which enables robust and transparent transformations. Our method recognizes complex memory access patterns in na\"ive HLS programs and automatically transforms them by inserting on-chip buffers to enforce linear access to off-chip memory, and by replacing non-sequential processing with stream processing, while preserving program semantics. Experiments using our prototype translator, combined with an off-the-shelf HLS compiler and a real FPGA board, have demonstrated significant performance improvements.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09217v2</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Materials] How charge frustration causes ion ordering and microphase separation at surfaces</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-025-02467-5</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Materials, Published online: 26 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-025-02467-5"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41563-025-02467-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Atomic force microscopy is used to investigate the adsorption and organization of ions on charged surfaces.

A precise determination of its electronic levels is essential for device-specific material-engineering. In this study, we report on the experimental determination of the ionization energy of the substitutional oxygen donor O&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; in sputter-deposited and subsequently high-temperature annealed AlN templates using temperature-dependent and time-resolved cathodoluminescence spectroscopy. The slow component of the oxygen-related defect luminescence, associated with donor–acceptor pair recombination and with decay times of hundreds of nanoseconds, exhibits distinct thermal quenching at temperatures above 250 K. By fitting this temperature dependence with a model based on the thermal emission of electrons from the donor level, we extract an ionization energy &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;ED&lt;/span&gt; = 371 ± 77 meV for the oxygen donor in AlN. This experimental value is in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions for the shallow substitutional O&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; donor and clearly distinct from calculated energies for the deeper oxygen DX center. This work provides an important experimental insight into this fundamental parameter in AlN.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/4/042101/3378097/Ionization-energy-of-the-oxygen-donor-in-AlN</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Integrated AlGaAs/GaAs betavoltaic arrays with low self-discharge LiCoO 2  batteries for efficient β-energy conversion and storage</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/4/043901/3378086/Integrated-AlGaAs-GaAs-betavoltaic-arrays-with-low</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Nuclear batteries are emerging power devices that convert radioactive decay energy into electricity. In this study, we developed a six-layer AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructure betavoltaic cell array by serially connecting six monocells on a single printed circuit board substrate, and a low-self-discharge Li-ion battery was integrated into the nuclear energy conversion and storage system. Through dual strategies of electrode modification and electrolyte optimization, we constructed an efficient hybrid energy conversion and storage system. To address self-discharge under microcurrent charging, two approaches were implemented: (1) constructing graphene-based conductive networks within LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathodes to reduce interfacial impedance via face-contact mechanisms, suppress Co&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; dissolution, and accelerate Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion; (2) incorporating fumaronitrile additive into the electrolyte to preferentially form stable cathode electrolyte interphase films, thereby inhibiting electrolyte decomposition and metal-ion catalyzed side reactions. These strategies suppressed self-discharge via physical/chemical pathways.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/4/043901/3378086/Integrated-AlGaAs-GaAs-betavoltaic-arrays-with-low</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Towards an understanding of photoluminescence in lead-free Cs2AgxNa1−xBiyIn1−yCl6 double perovskites by machine learning prediction from density functional theory ground state properties</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2026/DD/D5DD00152H</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/image/GA?id=D5DD00152H" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2026, Advance Article&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00152H, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Marina S.

Current models posit that replicative senescence is driven by telomere dysfunction, including telomere shortening, telomere-associated DNA damage response (DDR), and telomere oxidation. Here, we first show that aging primary human fibroblasts gradually increase the time spent in a CDK2-low non-cycling state and increase senescence biomarker expression. We then evaluate telomere features as single-cell senescence biomarkers in a workflow linking high-throughput, long-term time-lapse imaging with confocal imaging to map cell-cycle dynamics to telomere features in the same cell.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00176-8?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Cancer-associated fibroblasts as a critical driver in tumor metastasis: the mechanisms and future perspectives</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00163-X?rss=yes</link><description>Tumor metastasis represents a lethal event for patients due to the lack of effective treatments. Compared with primary tumors, the components of tumor microenvironment (TME) of metastatic tumors are different. Tumor cells alone are unable to metastasize. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as one major component of TME drive tumor metastasis. In metastatic lesions, the proportion of CAFs is significantly higher and are spatially close to tumor cells with high metastatic potential. CAFs themselves are resistant to chemoradiotherapy and have strong invasive ability based on their major role in degrading extracellular matrix (ECM).</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00163-X?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Disrupted gut microbiome networks and unhealthy behaviors predict metabolic dysfunction in children and adolescents in the long term</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00138-0?rss=yes</link><description>We recently showed that the individual gut microbiome (GM) configuration in children and adolescents, together with long-term dietary habits, can predict the development of obesity.

This study investigated intestinal dysbiosis in affected individuals using microbial profiling, genetic analysis, metabolomic assessment, and pathway modeling. Patients showed reduced microbial diversity, loss of beneficial species such as Faecalibacterium and Roseburia, and increased abundance of inflammatory taxa including Escherichia coli and Fusobacterium, alongside a marked decrease in the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid
