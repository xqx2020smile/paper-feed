Abstract: Gelation in the Smoluchowski coagulation equation is commonly interpreted as a finite-time singularity marked by mass loss or moment divergence. We instead characterize gelation as a loss of dynamical stability of the Smoluchowski flow, quantified through the time-dependent spectrum of the Jacobian along the evolving aggregation dynamics. Studying homogeneous kernels $K(i,j)=(ij)^{\alpha}$ together with the classical Smoluchowski, we show that gelation is consistently preceded by the appearance of positive real eigenvalues, indicating a loss of local dynamical stability. While non-gelling kernels exhibit only transient finite-size effects, gelling kernels display persistent spectral destabilization associated with macroscopic gel formation. Our results identify gelation as a genuine dynamical instability of the Smoluchowski flow.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18806v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Topological hybridisation of plasmons with ferrimagnetic magnons</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18995</link><description>arXiv:2601.18995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the formation of hybrid plasmon-magnon modes in a heterostructure comprising a monolayer semiconductor with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling -- specifically, Janus transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) -- and an insulating ferrimagnet, such as yttrium iron garnet-based compounds. Using a combined microscopic-macroscopic framework for plasmon-magnon coupling, we show that plasmons and magnons strongly hybridize over both GHz and THz frequency ranges, enabling experimental access well above cryogenic temperatures. Moreover, the developed approach provides an efficient and natural classification of the topology of the hybrid modes, rooted in the phase winding of the plasmon-magnon coupling induced by spin-momentum locking and the associated chiral winding of the electronic spin along the Fermi contours. Finally, we identify experimentally accessible manifestations of the hybridization, such as topological interface modes and an anomalous thermal Hall response.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18995v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Fundamental Tests of Quantum Geometric Bounds in Ionic and Covalent Insulators using Inelastic X-Ray Scattering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19054</link><description>arXiv:2601.19054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum geometry underlies many fundamental properties of materials, but it has remained largely inaccessible to direct experiment. Here we demonstrate that inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) provides a direct, quantitative probe of quantum geometry and quantum information in solids. Studying two prototype insulators, covalently bonded diamond and ionically bonded LiF, we measure the density response and experimentally determine the quantum Fisher information, the associated Bures metric, and the electron localization length. These measurements enable a quantitative comparison of quantum geometry for two distinct bonding environments. We find that the dimensionless quantum weight, $aK(q)$, which quantifies the longitudinal localization of quantum information, is constrained by fundamental electrostatic bounds in both materials. Crucially, the quantum weight of diamond exceeds that of LiF, indicating that covalent bonds exhibit a higher degree of delocalization and higher density of quantum information than the ionic bonds. Our results establish a direct experimental relationship between quantum information, electron localization, and chemical bonding, and identify IXS as a powerful tool for measuring quantum geometry in materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19054v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] $PT$ Symmetry's Real Topology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19069</link><description>arXiv:2601.19069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry-protected topological phases have been a central theme in condensed matter physics and beyond over the past two decades. Most efforts have focused on topological classifications of physical systems under given symmetries, while the intrinsic topology of the symmetries themselves has received much less attention. Here, we show that, in generic non-interacting spinless crystals, the spacetime inversion symmetry $PT$ naturally carries a real vector-bundle structure whose topology is characterized by Stiefel--Whitney (SW) classes. In contrast to previous work, where SW classes were used to describe the topology of real valence bundles protected by $PT$, we identify SW classes associated to the $PT$ symmetry itself. These symmetry SW classes can endow the \emph{total} real bundle of a $PT$-symmetric band structure with nontrivial topology, overturning the common assumption that the total bundle is always trivial. As a consequence, valence and conduction bands can exhibit asymmetric SW classes, in sharp contrast to the usual symmetric scenario. We further demonstrate that the symmetry SW classes provide a refined distinction between atomic insulator phases. Our results underscore the importance of treating crystal symmetries as topological objects in their own right, rather than focusing solely on the topology of energy bands.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19069v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Mapping optical, chemical, structural features in ZrO2 via cross-sectional SEM-Cathodoluminescence correlation microscopy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19428</link><description>arXiv:2601.19428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how nanoscale heterogeneities influence charge transport and mass transfer in oxides is critical for developing advanced materials for energy and electronic uses. In high-temperature applications, the formation of thermal oxides with complex chemical and structural features plays a central role in material lifetime. While thermally grown zirconia (ZrO2) on zirconium alloys exhibits strong chemical and microstructural gradients across the oxide thickness, linking these heterogeneities to electronic-defect landscapes remains challenging. We demonstrate cross-sectional scanning electron microscope-cathodoluminescence (SEM-CL) as a mesoscale probe of spatial variations in luminescence in zirconia and establish correlations with co-registered electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA) on the same region. The SEM-CL signal is dominated by the ~2.7 eV defect band, but its intensity varies strongly across the oxide cross section. Correlative EBSD-CL analysis reveals that CL intensity increases with grain area and decreases at the grain boundaries, consistent with enhanced non-radiative recombination associated with microstructural disorder. EPMA mapping shows that a substantial fraction of CL-dark features co-localize with secondary phase precipitates enriched in iron. These results show that SEM-CL contrast in corrosion-grown ZrO2 is controlled by both chemical heterogeneity and microstructural disorder, underscoring the need for correlative registration to interpret CL images. This multi-modal approach provides an efficient route to connect electronic properties and luminescence signatures across complex oxide cross sections to underlying chemistry and microstructure, thereby providing a pathway to relate local defect landscapes to regions likely to bias electronic/ionic transport during oxidation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19428v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Charge redistribution at metal-ZrO2 interfaces: A combined DFT and continuum electrostatic study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19436</link><description>arXiv:2601.19436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoscale metallic inclusions (NMIs) are commonly observed within oxide scales formed during high-temperature oxidation, revealing the existence of chemical and electronic heterogeneity beyond conventional corrosion theories that assume homogeneous, fully oxidized films. Using tetragonal zirconia (tZrO2) facing a series of face-centered cubic (fcc) metals as the model system, this work investigates the short-range and long-range charge redistributions across metal-oxide interfaces by coupling density functional theory (DFT) calculations with continuum modeling. We show that metal-oxide contact induces a short-range charge redistribution confined to a few atomic layers and a long-range redistribution of space charge that can extend over macroscopic distances within weakly doped oxides. DFT calculations show that the short-range redistribution is dominated by metal induced gap states (MIGS) in tZrO2 facing noble metals like Au and Ag, and by chemical bonding in tZrO2 facing active metals like Al. DFT-informed continuum theoretical analysis shows that the range of space-charge redistribution is governed by the doping level of tZrO2, and that the Schottky barrier height (SBH) exhibits a stronger dependence on the metal work function than the doping level. Both the short-range and long-range charge redistributions can alter the transport of charge carriers via their associated electric fields, extending several nm to hundreds of nm from the interface, depending on the doping concentrations, suggesting possible heterogeneous oxide growth caused by NMIs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19436v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Twisting Kelvin Cells for Enhanced Vibration Control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18911</link><description>arXiv:2601.18911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the propagation of elastic waves in periodic Kelvin-cell chains, focusing on symmetry-breaking geometric modifications induced by twisting the cell's faces. By imposing such twists, the original lattice topology is preserved, while mirror symmetries are strategically broken through modifying a single geometric parameter, allowing wave characteristics to be adjusted without additional resonators or mass augmentation. The complex-valued Bloch-Floquet analysis reveals that twisting activates two distinct wave attenuation mechanisms: Bragg-type band gaps associated with periodicity-induced scattering, and polarization-dependent band gaps arising from longitudinal-torsional mode coupling and avoided crossings. To obtain qualitative and quantitative insight into these mechanisms, a simplified analytical model with coupled translational and rotational degrees of freedom is considered. The finite-element wave transmission calculations are experimentally validated on SLA-printed three-cell specimens, for which wave attenuation reaches up to 20 dB within the predicted band-gap frequencies. Note that high prediction accuracy requires accounting for viscoelastic material behavior, underscoring the importance of material behavior on the wave propagation characteristics. Overall, the findings show that modest geometric modifications to a classical Kelvin-cell lattice can enhance wave-filtering behavior, offering a tractable design strategy for vibration control in lightweight architected lattices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18911v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Configurable p-Neurons Using Modular p-Bits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18943</link><description>arXiv:2601.18943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic bits (p-bits) have recently been employed in neural networks (NNs) as stochastic neurons with sigmoidal probabilistic activation functions. Nonetheless, there remain a wealth of other probabilistic activation functions that are yet to be explored. Here we re-engineer the p-bit by decoupling its stochastic signal path from its input data path, giving rise to a modular p-bit that enables the realization of probabilistic neurons (p-neurons) with a range of configurable probabilistic activation functions, including a probabilistic version of the widely used Logistic Sigmoid, Tanh and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation functions. We present spintronic (CMOS + sMTJ) designs that show wide and tunable probabilistic ranges of operation. Finally, we experimentally implement digital-CMOS versions on an FPGA, with stochastic unit sharing, and demonstrate an order of magnitude (10x) saving in required hardware resources compared to conventional digital p-bit implementations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18943v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Nonequilibrium phase transitions in a racism-spreading model with interaction-driven dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19806</link><description>arXiv:2601.19806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Racism remains a persistent societal issue, increasingly amplified by the structure and dynamics of online social networks. In this work, we propose a three-state compartmental model to study the spreading and suppression of racist content, drawing from epidemic-like dynamics and interaction-driven transitions. We analyze the model on fully-connected (homogeneous mixing) networks using a set of coupled differential equations, and on Barab\'asi-Albert (BA) scale-free and Watts-Strogatz (WS) small-world networks through agent-based simulations. The system exhibits three distinct stationary regimes: two racism-free absorbing states and one active phase with persistent racist content. We identify and characterize the phase transitions between these regimes, discuss the role of network topology, and highlight the emergence of absorbing states. Our findings illustrate how statistical physics tools can help uncover the macroscopic consequences of microscopic social interactions in digital environments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19806v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Bipartite Fluctuations and Charge Fractionalization in Quantum Wires</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14410</link><description>arXiv:2501.14410v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum information method for measuring fractional charges in ballistic quantum wires generalizing bipartite fluctuations to the chiral quasiparticles in Luttinger liquids, i.e. analyzing and summing charge and current fluctuations in a region of the wire. Bipartite fluctuations at equilibrium are characterized through a logarithmic scaling with distance encoding the entangled nature of these fractional charges in one-dimensional (1D) fluids. This approach clarifies the physical meaning of the dephasing factor of electronic interferences in a ballistic ring geometry at zero temperature, as a result of charge fractionalization. We formulate an analogy towards ground-state energetics. We show how bipartite current fluctuations represent a useful tool to locate quantum phase transitions associated to Mott physics. We address a spin chain equivalence and verify the fractional charges through an algorithm such as Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). Adding a potential difference between the two sides (parties) of the wire, bipartite fluctuations can detect a bound state localized at the interface through the Jackiw-Rebbi model coexisting with fractional charges.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.14410v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Absorbing state transitions with discrete symmetries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08702</link><description>arXiv:2502.08702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robust phases of matter, which remain stable under small perturbations, are of fundamental importance in statistical physics and quantum information. Recent advances in interactive quantum dynamics have led to renewed interest in out-of-equilibrium dynamical phases and associated phase transitions in both classical and quantum many-body systems. Motivated by these developments, we investigate whether a stable absorbing phase can exist in one-dimensional classical stochastic systems, with local update rules, in the presence of fluctuations. We study models with multiple absorbing states related by discrete symmetries, such as Z2 for two-state systems, and Z3 or S3 for three-state systems. In these models, domain walls perform random walks and coarsen under local rules, which, if perfect, eventually bring the system to an absorbing state in polynomial time. However, imperfect feedback can cause domain walls to branch, potentially leading to an opposing active phase. While two-state models exhibit a well-known transition between absorbing and active phases as the branching rate increases, in three-state models with only local dynamics, branching is a relevant perturbation, ruling out a robust absorbing phase under purely local rules. However, we discover that by incorporating nonlocal information into the feedback, the absorbing phase can be stabilized, with the transition between the active and absorbing phases belonging to a new universality class. Finally, we outline how these classical rules can be implemented using deterministic quantum circuits and discuss their connections to passive error correction.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.08702v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spin-Orbital Intertwined Topological Superconductivity in a Class of Correlated Noncentrosymmetric Materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10392</link><description>arXiv:2504.10392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we propose an alternative route to achieving topological superconductivity (TSC). Our approach applies to a new class of correlated noncentrosymmetric materials that host two spin-split Fermi surfaces with identical spin textures due to a spin-orbital intertwined effect. Incorporating multi-orbital repulsive Hubbard interactions, we calculate the superconducting pairings of a minimal two-orbital effective model within a spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity framework. We find that, depending on the effective Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) strength and filling level, the Hubbard interaction can drive the leading pairing symmetry into the $A_1(S_{\pm})$, $B_1$, $B_2$ or $B_2(d_{\pm})$ irreducible representations (IRs) of the $C_{4v}$ point group. Notably, the $A_1(S_{\pm})$ pairing gives rise to a fully gapped TSC characterized by a $Z_2$ invariant, while the $B_2(d_{\pm})$ pairing results in a nodal TSC. Our analysis reveals that the fully gapped TSC is predominated by spin-singlet regardless of the presence of the spin-triplet components. This distinguishes our model from noncentrosymmetric materials with conventional Rashba-split band structures, where TSC typically emerges near the van Hove singularity and is primarily driven by $p$-wave or $f$-wave spin-triplet pairing. These features enhances its experimental accessibility, and we discuss potential experimental systems for its realization.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.10392v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Fermion quantum criticality far from equilibrium</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14318</link><description>arXiv:2507.14318v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driving a quantum system out of equilibrium while preserving its subtle quantum mechanical correlations on large scales presents a major challenge, both fundamentally and for technological applications. At its core, this challenge is pinpointed by the question of how quantum effects can persist at asymptotic scales, analogous to quantum critical points in equilibrium. In this work, we construct such a scenario using fermions as building blocks. These fermions undergo an absorbing-to-absorbing state transition between two topologically distinct and quantum-correlated dark states. Starting from a microscopic, interacting Lindbladian, we derive an effective Lindblad-Keldysh field theory in which critical fermions couple to a bosonic bath with hydrodynamic fluctuations associated with particle number conservation. A key feature of this field theory is an emergent symmetry that protects the purity of the fermions' state even in the presence of the thermal bath. We quantitatively characterise the critical point using a leading-order expansion around the upper critical dimension, thereby establishing the first non-equilibrium universality class of fermions. The symmetry protection mechanism, which exhibits parallels to the problem of directed percolation, suggests a pathway toward a broader class of robust, universal quantum phenomena in fermionic systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.14318v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Detuning the Floquet anomalous chiral spin liquid</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23418</link><description>arXiv:2512.23418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At high-frequency a periodically-driven quantum spin-1/2 system can emulate a chiral spin liquid (CSL) described by an effective static local chiral Hamiltonian. In contrast, at low-frequency these settings realize "Swap" models exhibiting {\it anomalous} CSL phases, in which one-way spin transport occurs at the edge although the bulk time-evolution operator over one period is trivial. In this work we explicitly construct a family of Floquet quantum spin-1/2 models on the square lattice implementing Swap models to investigate the stability of the anomalous CSL under frequency detuning and the transition to the high-frequency regime. We used the average-energy spectrum on finite-size torus and cylinders to unfold the Floquet quasi-energy spectrum over the whole frequency range and obtain the geometrical Berry phases. This enabled us to identify three regimes upon increasing detuning: i) a finite-size regime (with no folding of the Floquet spectrum), ii) an intermediate (narrow) regime with folding and very few resonances and iii) a regime with an increased density of resonances suggesting heating. At small detuning, edge modes are revealed by spectroscopic tools and from the Streda response of the system giving access to the anomalous winding number. The analysis of all the data suggests that the anomalous CSL is not continuously connected to the high-frequency CSL. We also discuss the possible occurrence of a long-lived prethermal anomalous CSL.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23418v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Majorana Fermions in spin up and down electronic complexes in spin-orbit coupled array of semiconductor quantum dots in proximity to $s$-type superconductor and in magnetic field</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14527</link><description>arXiv:2601.14527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semiconductor-s-type superconductor nanowires host spinful fermions and cannot be reduced to a single spinless Kitaev chain hosting single Majorana zero mode. Instead, such systems can be converted into two coupled p-wave Kitaev-like chains associated with different spin sectors. Using the bond Fermion transformation and exact diagonalization, we analyze parity resolved spectra and local spectral functions, demonstrating that zero-energy modes strongly localized at the system boundaries emerge only in one effective chain. Inter-chain coupling lifts parity degeneracy and redistributes the low-energy spectral weight, providing a controlled framework to assess the stability of Majorana-like modes in the finite spinful nanowires.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14527v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Magnetic structure of EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$ single-crystal thin-film</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16365</link><description>arXiv:2601.16365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic topological materials are a class of compounds which can host massless electrons controlled by the magnetic order. One such compound is EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$, which has recently garnered interest due to its strong interplay between the Eu magnetism and charge carriers. However the topology of the electronic band structure, which depends on the ground state magnetic configuration of the europium sublattice, has not been determined. Based on our \textit{ab-initio} calculations, we find that an in-plane and out-of-plane \textit{A}-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) order generates a topological crystalline insulator and Dirac semimetal respectively, whereas a ferromagnetic (FM) order stabilizes a Weyl semimetal. Our resonant x-ray elastic scattering measurements of single-crystal thin film EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$ reveal both a sharp magnetic peak at $\textit{\textbf{Q}}$=$(0,0,\frac{1}{2})$ and broad $\textit{\textbf{Q}}$=$(0,0,1)$ below $T_{\mathrm{N}}=12.9$\,K, which is associated with an \textit{A}-type AFM and FM order, respectively. Our measurements indicate that the FM and AFM layers are spatially separated along the crystal $c$ axis, with the former limited to the top three atomic layers. We propose that EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$ behaves as a Weyl semimetal in the surface FM layers, and as a topological crystalline insulator in the lower AFM layers.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16365v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Generalized Wigner theorem for non-invertible symmetries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25327</link><description>arXiv:2509.25327v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the conditions under which a conservation law associated with a non-invertible operator may be realized as a symmetry in quantum mechanics. As established by Wigner, all quantum symmetries must be represented by either unitary or antiunitary transformations. Relinquishing an implicit assumption of invertibility, we demonstrate that the fundamental invariance of quantum transition probabilities under the application of symmetries mandates that all non-invertible symmetries may only correspond to {\it projective} unitary or antiunitary transformations, i.e., {\it partial isometries}. This extends the notion of physical states beyond conventional rays in Hilbert space to equivalence classes in an {\it extended, gauged Hilbert space}, thereby broadening the traditional understanding of symmetry transformations in quantum theory. We discuss consequences of this result and explicitly illustrate how, in simple model systems, whether symmetries be invertible or non-invertible may be inextricably related to the particular boundary conditions that are being used.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.25327v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] A Reconfigurable Framework for AI-FPGA Agent Integration and Acceleration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19263</link><description>arXiv:2601.19263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly deployed in real-time and energy-constrained environments, driving demand for hardware platforms that can deliver high performance and power efficiency. While central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) have traditionally served as the primary inference engines, their general-purpose nature often leads to inefficiencies under strict latency or power budgets. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer a promising alternative by enabling custom-tailored parallelism and hardware-level optimizations. However, mapping AI workloads to FPGAs remains challenging due to the complexity of hardware-software co-design and data orchestration. This paper presents AI FPGA Agent, an agent-driven framework that simplifies the integration and acceleration of deep neural network inference on FPGAs. The proposed system employs a runtime software agent that dynamically partitions AI models, schedules compute-intensive layers for hardware offload, and manages data transfers with minimal developer intervention. The hardware component includes a parameterizable accelerator core optimized for high-throughput inference using quantized arithmetic. Experimental results demonstrate that the AI FPGA Agent achieves over 10x latency reduction compared to CPU baselines and 2-3x higher energy efficiency than GPU implementations, all while preserving classification accuracy within 0.2% of full-precision references. These findings underscore the potential of AI-FPGA co-design for scalable, energy-efficient AI deployment.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19263v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] GenPairX: A Hardware-Algorithm Co-Designed Accelerator for Paired-End Read Mapping</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19384</link><description>arXiv:2601.19384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genome sequencing has become a central focus in computational biology. A genome study typically begins with sequencing, which produces millions to billions of short DNA fragments known as reads. Read mapping aligns these reads to a reference genome. Read mapping for short reads comes in two forms: single-end and paired-end, with the latter being more prevalent due to its higher accuracy and support for advanced analysis. Read mapping remains a major performance bottleneck in genome analysis due to expensive dynamic programming. Prior efforts have attempted to mitigate this cost by employing filters to identify and potentially discard computationally expensive matches and leveraging hardware accelerators to speed up the computations. While partially effective, these approaches have limitations. In particular, existing filters are often ineffective for paired-end reads, as they evaluate each read independently and exhibit relatively low filtering ratios. In this work, we propose GenPairX, a hardware-algorithm co-designed accelerator that efficiently minimizes the computational load of paired-end read mapping while enhancing the throughput of memory-intensive operations. GenPairX introduces: (1) a novel filtering algorithm that jointly considers both reads in a pair to improve filtering effectiveness, and a lightweight alignment algorithm to replace most of the computationally expensive dynamic programming operations, and (2) two specialized hardware mechanisms to support the proposed algorithms. Our evaluations show that GenPairX delivers substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art solutions, achieving 1575x and 1.43x higher throughput per watt compared to leading CPU-based and accelerator-based read mappers, respectively, all without compromising accuracy.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19384v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Veri-Sure: A Contract-Aware Multi-Agent Framework with Temporal Tracing and Formal Verification for Correct RTL Code Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19747</link><description>arXiv:2601.19747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of Electronic Design Automation (EDA), the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Register-Transfer Level (RTL) design has emerged as a promising direction. However, silicon-grade correctness remains bottlenecked by: (i) limited test coverage and reliability of simulation-centric evaluation, (ii) regressions and repair hallucinations introduced by iterative debugging, and (iii) semantic drift as intent is reinterpreted across agent handoffs. In this work, we propose Veri-Sure, a multi-agent framework that establishes a design contract to align agents' intent and uses a patching mechanism guided by static dependency slicing to perform precise, localized repairs. By integrating a multi-branch verification pipeline that combines trace-driven temporal analysis with formal verification consisting of assertion-based checking and boolean equivalence proofs, Veri-Sure enables functional correctness beyond pure simulations. We also introduce VerilogEval-v2-EXT, extending the original benchmark with 53 more industrial-grade design tasks and stratified difficulty levels, and show that Veri-Sure achieves state-of-the-art verified-correct RTL code generation performance, surpassing standalone LLMs and prior agentic systems.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19747v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Is Finer Better? The Limits of Microscaling Formats in Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19026</link><description>arXiv:2601.19026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microscaling data formats leverage per-block tensor quantization to enable aggressive model compression with limited loss in accuracy. Unlocking their potential for efficient training and inference necessitates hardware-friendly implementations that handle matrix multiplications in a native format and adopt efficient error-mitigation strategies. Herein, we report the emergence of a surprising behavior associated with microscaling quantization, whereas the output of a quantized model degrades as block size is decreased below a given threshold. This behavior clashes with the expectation that a smaller block size should allow for a better representation of the tensor elements. We investigate this phenomenon both experimentally and theoretically, decoupling the sources of quantization error behind it. Experimentally, we analyze the distributions of several Large Language Models and identify the conditions driving the anomalous behavior. Theoretically, we lay down a framework showing remarkable agreement with experimental data from pretrained model distributions and ideal ones. Overall, we show that the anomaly is driven by the interplay between narrow tensor distributions and the limited dynamic range of the quantized scales. Based on these insights, we propose the use of FP8 unsigned E5M3 (UE5M3) as a novel hardware-friendly format for the scales in FP4 microscaling data types. We demonstrate that UE5M3 achieves comparable performance to the conventional FP8 unsigned E4M3 scales while obviating the need of global scaling operations on weights and activations.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19026v1</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Development of Accurate Transferable Hydrofluorocarbon Refrigerant Force Fields Using a Machine Learning and Optimization Approach</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00537J</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, Accepted Manuscript&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00537J, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Montana N.

Abstract: Machine learning models for functional materials design require precise and informative representations of material systems. Common representations encode atomic composition and bonding but often do not include local coordination environments across chemically diverse crystals. Recurring structural motifs provide a motif level description of crystalline solids and can serve as interpretable descriptors for structure property learning. To analyze the motif connectivity in materials, we construct a bipartite material motif network from 131,548 Materials Project entries, with materials and motifs as the two node sets. Edges connect materials to their constituent motifs and are weighted by motif distortion, which quantifies the strength of each material motif association. Network connectivity is analyzed to identify motif-defined material clusters that capture recurring local geometries relevant to structure property trends. Most shared motifs act as hubs that connect otherwise disconnected regions of the network, enabling motif guided screening by expanding from known motifs to nearby materials in the same neighborhoods. A network embedding step converts this weighted connectivity into vector representations of materials. Using these motif informed embeddings, property prediction yields a formation energy mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.157 eV per atom and a bandgap MAE of 0.601 eV. These results indicate that motif connectivity provides a compact, interpretable representation that complements existing descriptors for scalable screening and structure property modeling.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17170v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Erbium Probes of Magnetic Order in a Layered van der Waals Material</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17516</link><description>arXiv:2601.17516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is growing interest in characterizing magnetic order and dynamics in two-dimensional magnets, yet most efforts to date rely on external probes that interrogate the sample from tens of nanometers away and inevitably average over that length scale. Here we use internal, lattice-embedded Er3+ defects in CrSBr as atomic-scale probes, accessing their telecom-band photoluminescence with spectroscopy and temperature-dependent confocal imaging to read out magnetism from within the material. At room temperature we observe narrow, long-lived photoluminescence (PL) lines in the telecom band, characteristic of erbium emitters. Upon cooling to 3 K and reheating, the Er3+ PL intensity and excited-state lifetime display pronounced thermal hysteresis with a minimum near 132 K, at the reported antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition of CrSBr. Remarkably, we observe magnetic signatures persisting over a broader temperature range than expected from bulk benchmarks, suggesting nanoscale magnetic order that locally survives beyond the nominal phase boundary. Further, a moderate in-plane field of 0.3 T shifts the PL minimum by +8 K, which we tentatively associate to field-biased ferromagnetic correlations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17516v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Breakdown of bosonic Thouless pump due to interaction in a quasiperiodic lattice</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18229</link><description>arXiv:2601.18229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of inter-particle interaction on the quantized Thouless pump in the bosonic quasiperiodic Aubry-Andr{\'e} model and find that the quantization of the pumped charge breaks down already for weak interactions. Furthermore, the pumped charge undergoes sharp changes as a function of interaction strength that we can attribute to the closing of specific doublon channels. As expected, the quantization revives in the hard-core limit at very large interaction strengths where the bosons are subject to a hardcore constraint. Interestingly, the stability of isolated doublons under the pump depends on the band they are in. For repulsive interactions and a suitably fixed pump period, doublons in the lowest band are pumped stably while doublons in higher bands dissociate during the pump with one particle decaying into a lower band. This asymmetry leads to the decay of the total energy over time, in stark contrast to the typical Floquet heating expected for a driven many-body system.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18229v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Direct observation of vortex liquid droplets in the iron pnictide superconductor CaKAs$_4$Fe$_4$ at $0.5T$_c$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18247</link><description>arXiv:2601.18247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type-II superconductors under magnetic fields are in a quantum coherent non-dissipative state as long as vortices remain pinned. Dissipation appears when vortices depin, eventually driven by thermal fluctuations. This can be associated to a melting transition between a vortex solid and a vortex liquid. This transition is almost always observed very close to T$_c$ when probed by macroscopic experiments. However, it remains unclear how the vortex solid responds to thermal fluctuations at the scale of individual vortices far from the melting transition. Here we use scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to visualize vortices in CaKAs$_4$Fe$_4$ (T$_c \approx$ 35 K). We find vortex liquid droplets-localized regions in space where vortices strongly fluctuate due to thermal exctiation-at temperatures as low as 0.5\,T$_c$. Our results show that the onset of dissipation at the local scale occurs at temperatures considerably below T$_c$ in type-II superconductors.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18247v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Role of transfer films and interfacial cracking in metallic sliding wear</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18603</link><description>arXiv:2601.18603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of wear particles in metallic sliding contacts remains debated. Classical views based on cold-welded junctions suggest that plastic yielding of the real contact area should lead to large wear coefficients, in apparent contradiction with the small values typically measured for metals. Here we argue that this discrepancy can be resolved if most junctions do not directly produce wear particles, but instead cause metal transfer and the formation of a weakly bound transfer film. Wear then occurs intermittently when fragments of this film detach due to crack propagation at the interface between the transfer film and the underlying bulk metal. We perform unlubricated reciprocating sliding experiments on nominally smooth stainless steel, brass, and aluminum. For steel on steel, the wear mass loss shows an initial stage with negligible mass change up to a sliding distance of $\sim 2.4 \ {\rm m}$, followed by a linear regime. Transfer-film formation in dissimilar-metal contacts is evidenced by optical imaging, net mass gain of the steel slider, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and the collected debris is flake-like. These observations support a transfer-film-controlled wear mechanism associated with cold-welded junctions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18603v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Unraveling Surface Chemistry of irreversible reduction of iron oxides through the Time-Resolved APXPS and Chemometrics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17052</link><description>arXiv:2601.17052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a study on the application of Time-Resolved Ambient Pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (TR-APXPS) in association with chemometric techniques, specifically Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multivariate Curve Resolution with Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS), to investigate the surface chemistry and dynamics of Fe2O3 reduction processes. The use of TR-APXPS allows for real-time monitoring of chemical changes at the surface of Iron oxides during reduction, providing valuable insights into the reaction mechanisms and kinetics involved. One key challenge in analyzing TR-APXPS data is the presence of overlapping peaks and complex spectral features, which can make accurate quantification and interpretation difficult. Traditional spectral fitting methods may struggle with these complexities and result in ambiguous or inaccurate results. However, the chemometric approaches are promising tools to overcome these challenges by extracting pure spectral profiles of individual chemical species and their temporal profiles from the complex and overlapping data. The results obtained from the TR-APXPS coupled with PCA and MCR-ALS analysis provide a detailed and precise understanding of the surface chemical changes during the Fe2O3 reduction. This includes identifying and following the formation of various intermediate species and their evolution over time, which permits later to establish correlations between surface chemistry and process conditions. The integration of both chemometric tools in TR-APXPS data analysis not only addresses the challenges associated with complex spectral features, but also contributes to a deeper understanding of the underlying chemical changes and their dynamics. The obtained results have significant implications for process optimization, material synthesis, and tailoring of material properties for specific applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17052v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Probing sine dilaton gravity with flow central charge</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17698</link><description>arXiv:2601.17698v1 Announce Type: cross

Abstract: Are there hidden dynamical common patterns in the evolution of social and cultural history? While the growing availability of digitized social data invites us to answer this question, prevailing quantitative methods often rely on deterministic snapshots or average effects. Such approaches overlook the continuous and inherently uncertain nature of historical trajectories. In this paper, we propose a framework for modeling historical dynamics as stochastic processes described by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). By viewing historical change through the lens of continuous-time dynamics, this framework provides a natural language to describe how structural trends and inherent random fluctuations interact to shape societal evolution. This approach allows us to handle the uncertainty in fragmentary historical records, moving beyond the dichotomy of structural determinism versus pure chance. We demonstrate that adopting this stochastic perspective unlocks a rich suite of analytical capabilities unavailable to static models. Specifically, we introduce methods to: (1) quantify the irreversibility; (2) detect exogenous perturbations; (3) perform multiple imputation for missing historical records. This framework offers a unified methodology for dissecting the stability, contingency, and dynamics of historical change.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17772v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Electronic analogue of Fourier optics with mass-less Dirac fermions scattered by quantum dot lattice</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11259</link><description>arXiv:2402.11259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of electron optics exploits the analogy between the movement of electrons or charged quasiparticles, primarily in two-dimensional materials subjected to electric and magnetic (EM) fields and the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a dielectric medium with varied refractive index. We significantly extend this analogy by introducing an electronic analogue of Fourier optics dubbed as Fourier electron optics (FEO) with massless Dirac fermions (MDF), namely the charge carriers of single-layer graphene under ambient conditions, by considering their scattering from a two-dimensional quantum dot lattice (TDQDL) treated within Lippmann-Schwinger formalism. By considering the scattering of MDF from TDQDL with a defect region, as well as the moir\'{e} pattern of twisted TDQDLs, we establish an electronic analogue of Babinet's principle in optics. Exploiting the similarity of the resulting differential scattering cross-section with the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern, we construct a dictionary for such FEO. Subsequently, we evaluate the resistivity of such scattered MDF using the Boltzmann approach as a function of the angle made between the direction of propagation of these charge-carriers and the symmetry axis of the dot-lattice, and Fourier analyze them to show that the spatial frequency associated with the angle-resolved resistivity gets filtered according to the structural changes in the dot lattice, indicating wider applicability of FEO of MDF.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2402.11259v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Current Flow in Topological Insulator Josephson Junctions due to Imperfections</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10335</link><description>arXiv:2411.10335v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments on planar superconductor-topological insulator-superconductor (S-TI-S) junctions, e.g., in Corbino geometry, have reported low-temperature nonzero Josephson currents in states with integer fluxoid (flux) induced in the junction by a perpendicular magnetic field. This effect was discussed in connection with Majorana zero modes localized in Josephson vortices of such junctions. Here, we provide an explanation for this phenomenon, attributing it to imperfections. We focus on the ``atomic" limit in which the low-energy bound states of different vortices do not overlap. In this limit, we can associate the nonvanishing critical current with the irregularities, e.g., in the junction's width. The low-temperature contribution to the current is provided by the bound states with low but nonzero energy. We also propose clear experimental tests based on microwave spectroscopy, revealing distinctive selection rules for vortex transitions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.10335v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Soft symmetries of topological orders</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03314</link><description>arXiv:2501.03314v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (2+1)D topological orders possess emergent symmetries given by a group $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$, which consists of the braided tensor autoequivalences of the modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ that describes the anyons. In this paper we discuss cases where $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$ has elements that neither permute anyons nor are associated to any symmetry fractionalization but are still non-trivial, which we refer to as soft symmetries. We point out that one can construct topological defects corresponding to such exotic symmetry actions by decorating with a certain class of gauged SPT states that cannot be distinguished by their torus partition function. This gives a physical interpretation to work by Davydov on soft braided tensor autoequivalences. This has a number of important implications for the classification of gapped boundaries, non-invertible spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the general classification of symmetry-enriched topological phases of matter. We also demonstrate analogous phenomena in higher dimensions, such as (3+1)D gauge theory with gauge group given by the quaternion group $Q_8$.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.03314v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Planar Josephson junction devices with narrow superconducting strips: Topological properties and optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04468</link><description>arXiv:2504.04468v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the low-energy physics of planar Josephson junction structures realized in a quasi-two dimensional semiconductor system proximity-coupled to narrow superconducting films. Using both a recursive Green's function approach and an effective Hamiltonian approximation, we investigate the topological superconducting phase predicted to emerge in this type of system. We first characterize the effects associated with varying the electrostatic potentials applied within the unproximitized semiconductor regions. We then address the problem of optimizing the width of the superconductor films and identifying the optimal regimes characterized by large topological gap values. We find that structures with narrow superconducting films of widths ranging between about $100~$nm and $200~$nm can support topological superconducting phases with gaps up to $40\%$ of the parent superconducting gap, significantly larger than those characterizing the corresponding wide-superconductor structures. This work represents the first component of a proposed comprehensive strategy to address this optimization problem in planar Josephson junction structures and realize robust topological devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.04468v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Strongly nonlinear Bernstein modes in graphene reveal plasmon-enhanced near-field magnetoabsorption</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25443</link><description>arXiv:2510.25443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bernstein modes -- hybrid magnetoplasmon excitations arising from the coupling between cyclotron motion and collective oscillations in two-dimensional electron systems -- offer direct access to non-local electrodynamics. These modes can exhibit rich nonlinear behavior akin to strong-coupling phenomena in cavity quantum electrodynamics, but reaching nonlinear regime has remained experimentally challenging. Here we report the observation of nonlinear Bernstein modes in graphene using terahertz excitation with near-field enhancement from embedded metallic contacts. Photoresistance spectroscopy reveals sharp resonances at Bc/2 and Bc/3 that saturate at radiation intensities nearly an order of magnitude lower than the cyclotron resonance. We ascribe this to strong local heating of the electron gas due to resonant excitation of high-amplitude Bernstein magnetoplasmons, associated with a combination of the field-concentration effect of the near field and plasmonic amplification that is resonantly enhanced in the region of Bernstein gaps. Polarization-resolved measurements further confirm the near-field origin: Bernstein resonances are insensitive to circular helicity but strongly depend on the angle of linear polarization, in sharp contrast to the cyclotron resonance response. Our results establish graphene as a platform for nonlinear magnetoplasmonics, opening opportunities for strong-field manipulation of collective electron dynamics, out-of-equilibrium electron transport, and solid-state analogues of cavity quantum electrodynamics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.25443v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Brightening of dark trions in monolayer WS$_2$ via localization of surface plasmons</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10856</link><description>arXiv:2512.10856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among all excitonic complexes in transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), dark and semi-dark trions are poised to play a stellar role in future quantum technologies due to their long lifetimes, about two orders of magnitude greater than those of their bright counterparts. In monolayer (ML) tungsten disulphide (WS$_2$), accessing these states via a suitable brightening mechanism remains challenging, specially, at elevated temperatures. Here, we demonstrate the brightening of dark trions from ML WS$_2$ over the temperature range, 83 K-115 K, enabled by localized surface plasmon modes in a disordered gold substrate. The resulting photoluminescence (PL) spectrum reveals a distinct spectral doublet with the twin peaks of semi-dark and bright trion states, separated by $\sim$ 45 meV. The origin of the semi-dark trion state lies in intervalley electron-electron scatterings, while its visibility in the PL spectrum is made possible by the enhanced out-of-plane electromagnetic field associated with plasmon localization. We also report on the negative degree of circular polarization in ML WS$_2$ at the energy of the semi-dark trion state. Our results establish a scalable plasmonic route to access valley-polarized semi-dark trions, opening new opportunities for quantum and valleytronic applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.10856v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dissociation Line and Driving Force for Nucleation of the Multiple Occupied Hydrogen Hydrate from Computer Simulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22583</link><description>arXiv:2512.22583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we determine the dissociation temperature of the hydrogen (H$_2$) hydrate by computer simulation using two different methods. In both cases, the molecules of water and H$_2$ are modeled using the TIP4P/Ice and a modified version of the Silvera and Goldman models respectively, and the Berthelot combining rule for the cross water-H$_2$ interactions has been modified. The first method used in this work is the solubility method which consists in determining the solubility of H$_2$ in an aqueous phase when in contact with a H$_2$ hydrate (H--L$_{\text{w}}$) phase and when in contact with a pure H$_2$ phase (L$_{\text{w}}$--L$_{\text{H}_2}$) at different temperatures. At a given pressure value, both solubility curves intersect at the temperature ($T_3$) at which the three phases coexist in equilibrium. Following this approach, we determine the dissociation temperature of the H$_2$ hydrate at $185\,\text{MPa}$ finding a good agreement with the data previously reported in the literature. We also analyze the effect of the multiple occupancy of the D, or small, and H, or large, cages of the sII hydrate structure. We conclude that the $T_3$ value is barely affected by the occupancy of the H$_2$ hydrate at $185\,\text{MPa}$. From the analysis of the solubility curves and performing extra bulk simulations of the three phases involved in the equilibrium, we also determine the driving force for nucleation ($\Delta\mu^{\text{EC}}_{N}$) at $185\,\text{MPa}$ as a function of the supercooling degree and the H$_2$ hydrate occupancy. We determine that, thermodynamically, the most favored occupancy of the H$_2$ hydrate consists of 1 H$_2$ molecule in the D cages and 3 in the H cages (named as 1-3 occupancy).</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22583v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Additive-Functional Approach to Transport in Periodic and Tilted Periodic Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13561</link><description>arXiv:2601.13561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this Letter, we clarify the physical origin of effective transport in periodic and tilted periodic systems. When Brownian dynamics is examined on the scale of a single period, the particle displacement admits a natural separation into a bounded part associated with recurrent motion within the periodic landscape, and an unbounded stochastic part that grows in time and carries the net transport. We show that effective drift and diffusion are governed entirely by this unbounded component, while local potential-induced fluctuations contribute only bounded corrections. Treating the displacement as an additive functional of the stochastic dynamics provides a rigorous formulation of this separation and leads to a corrector-martingale representation at the trajectory level. Within this framework, classical results-including the Lifson-Jackson formula for unbiased periodic systems and the Stratonovich expressions for tilted periodic potentials-follow as direct consequences of the same underlying structure. The same perspective extends naturally to higher-dimensional periodic environments, recovering the standard homogenized transport tensors.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13561v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Exciton-Anyon Binding in Fractional Chern Insulators: Spectral Fingerprints</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14365</link><description>arXiv:2601.14365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transition--metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) uniquely combine topological electronic states realized without external magnetic fields with a strong optical response arising from long--lived excitons. Motivated by this confluence, we investigate an interacting fermion--boson system formed by coupling an exciton to a quasihole of a fractional Chern insulator (FCI) at filling fraction $1/3$. We introduce a kagome--lattice fermion--boson model hosting an electronic FCI and a mobile exciton whose dispersion is tunable from a parabolic band to a flatband. Using exact diagonalization, we demonstrate the emergence of exciton--quasihole bound states controlled by the repulsive electron--exciton interaction $V_{\mathrm{FB}}$ and the exciton kinetic energy $t_{\mathrm{B}}$. These states appear as low--lying levels in the fermion--boson spectrum, well separated from the scattering continuum, and arise despite repulsive interactions due to a residual attraction to the local charge depletion associated with a quasihole. Reducing $t_{\mathrm{B}}$ enhances this effect by favoring interaction--dominated binding. Our results provide a model description of moir\'e TMD heterostructures, including fractional Chern insulating twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ proximitized by excitonic TMD heterobilayers, where we estimate exciton--quasihole binding energy scales of $0.6$--$1.1$~meV, placing these effects within reach of photoluminescence spectroscopy.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14365v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Adversarial Robustness Guarantees for Quantum Classifiers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10360</link><description>arXiv:2405.10360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their ever more widespread deployment throughout society, machine learning algorithms remain critically vulnerable to being spoofed by subtle adversarial tampering with their input data. The prospect of near-term quantum computers being capable of running {quantum machine learning} (QML) algorithms has therefore generated intense interest in their adversarial vulnerability. Here we show that quantum properties of QML algorithms can confer fundamental protections against such attacks, in certain scenarios guaranteeing robustness against classically-armed adversaries. We leverage tools from many-body physics to identify the quantum sources of this protection. Our results offer a theoretical underpinning of recent evidence which suggest quantum advantages in the search for adversarial robustness. In particular, we prove that quantum classifiers are: (i) protected against weak perturbations of data drawn from the trained distribution, (ii) protected against local attacks if they are insufficiently scrambling, and (iii) show evidence that they are protected against universal adversarial attacks if they are sufficiently chaotic. Our analytic results are supported by numerical evidence demonstrating the applicability of our theorems and the resulting robustness of a quantum classifier in practice. This line of inquiry constitutes a concrete pathway to advantage in QML, orthogonal to the usually sought improvements in model speed or accuracy.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2405.10360v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Superconducting integrated on-demand quantum memory with microwave pulse preservation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02570</link><description>arXiv:2506.02570v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microwave quantum memory represents a critical component for quantum radars and resource-efficient approaches to quantum error correction. Superconducting microwave resonators provide highly efficient storage, long coherence times, on-demand reading and even in memory pulse engineering, but it is still challenging to overcome design and materials induced loss channels for on-chip realization. In this work, we present a novel architecture of integrated superconducting quantum memory with a dynamically controlled RF-SQUID coupling element in pulse regime, thus ensuring high efficiency storage and cycling storage time. It demonstrates a memory cycle time of 1.51 $\mu s$ and 57.5% storage fidelity with preservation of the stored pulse shape during the retrieval at single-photon level excitations. We establish that while the proposed active coupler realization introduces no measurable fidelity degradation, the primary limitation arises from impedance matching and materials imperfections. Still the device was used only for storing finite-duration near-single-photon classical microwave pulses, we assert that it operates as a linear device when the photon population in the common resonator remains low so it should be compatible with quantum state storage.The proposed architecture highlights a disruptive potential for on-chip qubit and memory integration for scalable quantum error correction, while identifying specific avenues for near-unity storage fidelity.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.02570v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Partial projected ensembles and spatiotemporal structure of information scrambling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05632</link><description>arXiv:2508.05632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermalisation and information scrambling in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems are deeply intertwined: local subsystems dynamically approach thermal density matrices while their entropies track information spreading. Projected ensembles--ensembles of pure states conditioned on measurement outcomes of complementary subsystems--provide higher-order probes of thermalisation, converging at late times to universal maximum-entropy ensembles. In this work, we introduce the partial projected ensemble (PPE) as a framework to study how the spatiotemporal structure of scrambling is imprinted on projected ensembles. The PPE consists of an ensemble of mixed states induced on a subsystem by measurements on a spatially separated part of its complement, tracing out the remainder, naturally capturing scenarios involving discarded outcomes or noise-induced losses. We show that statistical fluctuations of the PPE faithfully track the causal lightcone of information spreading, revealing how scrambling dynamics are encoded in ensemble structure. In addition, we demonstrate that the probabilities of bit-string probabilities (PoPs) associated with the PPE exhibit distinct dynamical regimes and provide an experimentally accessible probe of scrambling. Both PPE fluctuations and PoPs display exponential sensitivity to the size of the discarded region, reflecting exponential degradation of quantum correlations under erasure. We substantiate these findings using the non-integrable kicked Ising chain, combining numerics in the ergodic regime with exact results at its self-dual point. We extend our analysis to a many-body localised (MBL) regime numerically, along with analytic results for the $\ell$-bit model. The linear and logarithmic lightcones characteristic of ergodic and MBL regimes emerge naturally from PPE dynamics, establishing it as a powerful tool for probing scrambling and deep thermalisation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.05632v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Saddle Hierarchy in Dense Associative Memory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19151</link><description>arXiv:2508.19151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dense Associative Memory (DAM) models have been attracting renewed attention since they were shown to be robust to adversarial examples and closely related to cutting edge machine learning paradigms, such as the attention mechanism and generative diffusion. We study a DAM built upon a three-layer Boltzmann machine with Potts hidden units, which represent data clusters and classes. Through a statistical mechanics analysis, we derive saddle-point equations that characterize both the stationary points of DAMs trained on real data and the fixed points of DAMs trained on synthetic data within a teacher-student framework. Based on these results, we propose a novel regularization scheme that makes training significantly more stable. Moreover, we show empirically that our DAM learns interpretable solutions to both supervised and unsupervised classification problems. Pushing our theoretical analysis further, we find that the weights learned by relatively small DAMs correspond to unstable saddle points in larger DAMs. We implement a network-growing algorithm that leverages this saddle-point hierarchy to drastically reduce the computational cost of training dense associative memory.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.19151v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum Entanglement as a Cohomological Obstruction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04326</link><description>arXiv:2511.04326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We recast quantum entanglement as a cohomological obstruction to reconstructing a global quantum state from locally compatible information. We address this by considering presheaf cohomologies of states and entanglement witnesses. Sheafification erases the global-from-local signature while leaving within-patch multipartite structure, captured by local entanglement groups introduced here. For smooth parameter families, the obstruction admits a differential-geometric representative obtained by pairing an appropriate witness field with the curvature of a natural unitary connection on the associated bundle of amplitudes. We also introduce a Quantum Entanglement Index (QEI) as an index-theoretic invariant of entangled states and explain its behavior. Finally, we outline a theoretical physics approach to probe these ideas in quantum many-body systems and suggest a possible entanglement-induced correction as an experimental validation. Detailed numerical implementations for concrete quantum many-body models are presented in the companion paper \cite{2026arXiv260113467I}.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.04326v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] SPADE: A SIMD Posit-enabled compute engine for Accelerating DNN Efficiency</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17279</link><description>arXiv:2601.17279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for edge-AI systems requires arithmetic units that balance numerical precision, energy efficiency, and compact hardware while supporting diverse formats. Posit arithmetic offers advantages over floating- and fixed-point representations through its tapered precision, wide dynamic range, and improved numerical robustness. This work presents SPADE, a unified multi-precision SIMD Posit-based multiplyaccumulate (MAC) architecture supporting Posit (8,0), Posit (16,1), and Posit (32,2) within a single framework. Unlike prior single-precision or floating/fixed-point SIMD MACs, SPADE introduces a regime-aware, lane-fused SIMD Posit datapath that hierarchically reuses Posit-specific submodules (LOD, complementor, shifter, and multiplier) across 8/16/32-bit precisions without datapath replication. FPGA implementation on a Xilinx Virtex-7 shows 45.13% LUT and 80% slice reduction for Posit (8,0), and up to 28.44% and 17.47% improvement for Posit (16,1) and Posit (32,2) over prior work, with only 6.9% LUT and 14.9% register overhead for multi-precision support. ASIC results across TSMC nodes achieve 1.38 GHz at 6.1 mW (28 nm). Evaluation on MNIST, CIFAR-10/100, and alphabet datasets confirms competitive inference accuracy.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17279v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Memory-Efficient FPGA Implementation of Stochastic Simulated Annealing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18007</link><description>arXiv:2601.18007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulated annealing (SA) is a well-known algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. However, the computation time of SA increases rapidly, as the size of the problem grows. Recently, a stochastic simulated annealing (SSA) algorithm that converges faster than conventional SA has been reported. In this paper, we present a hardware-aware SSA (HA- SSA) algorithm for memory-efficient FPGA implementations. HA-SSA can reduce the memory usage of storing intermediate results while maintaining the computing speed of SSA. For evaluation purposes, the proposed algorithm is compared with the conventional SSA and SA approaches on maximum cut combinatorial optimization problems. HA-SSA achieves a convergence speed that is up to 114-times faster than that of the conventional SA algorithm depending on the maximum cut problem selected from the G-set which is a dataset of the maximum cut problems. HA-SSA is implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) (Xilinx Kintex-7), and it achieves up to 6-times the memory efficiency of conventional SSA while maintaining high solution quality for optimization problems.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18007v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Real-Time, Energy-Efficient, Sampling-Based Optimal Control via FPGA Acceleration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17231</link><description>arXiv:2601.17231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), used for search-and-rescue and remote exploration, require fast and robust planning and control schemes. Sampling-based approaches for Model Predictive Control, especially approaches based on the Model Predictive Path Integral Control (MPPI) algorithm, have recently proven both to be highly effective for such applications and to map naturally to GPUs for hardware acceleration. However, both GPU and CPU implementations of such algorithms can struggle to meet tight energy and latency budgets on battery-constrained AMR platforms that leverage embedded compute. To address this issue, we present an FPGA-optimized MPPI design that exposes fine-grained parallelism and eliminates synchronization bottlenecks via deep pipelining and parallelism across algorithmic stages. This results in an average 3.1x to 7.5x speedup over optimized implementations on an embedded GPU and CPU, respectively, while simultaneously achieving a 2.5x to 5.4x reduction in energy usage. These results demonstrate that FPGA architectures are a promising direction for energy-efficient and high-performance edge robotics.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17231v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] @NTT: Algorithm-Targeted NTT hardware acceleration via Design-Time Constant Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17806</link><description>arXiv:2601.17806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) is a critical computational bottleneck in many lattice-based postquantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms. By leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm, the NTT of a polynomial of degree N - 1 can be computed with a time complexity of O(N log N). Hardware implementation of NTT is generally preferred over software ones, as the latter are significantly slower due to complex memory access patterns and modular arithmetic operations. Achieving maximum throughput in hardware, however, typically demands a prohibitively large number of butterfly unit instantiations. In this work, we propose @NTT, which exploits the fact that the ring parameters in these algorithms are fixed, enabling design-time constant optimization and achieving the maximum throughput of N-point NTT per clock cycle with a compact hardware footprint. Our case study on the Dilithium NTT, implemented using the TSMC 28 nm library, operates at a clock frequency of 1.0 GHz with an area of 1.45 mm^2. On FPGA, the design achieves a throughput-per-LUT that is 5.2x higher than the state-of-the-art implementation.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17806v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] MetaML-Pro: Cross-Stage Design Flow Automation for Efficient Deep Learning Acceleration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05850</link><description>arXiv:2502.05850v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework for codifying and automating optimization strategies to efficiently deploy deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained hardware, such as FPGAs, while maintaining high performance, accuracy, and resource efficiency. Deploying DNNs on such platforms involves addressing the significant challenge of balancing performance, resource usage (e.g., DSPs and LUTs), and inference accuracy, which often requires extensive manual effort and domain expertise. Our novel approach addresses two core key issues: (i)~encoding custom optimization strategies and (ii)~enabling cross-stage optimization search. In particular, our proposed framework seamlessly integrates programmatic DNN optimization techniques with high-level synthesis (HLS)-based metaprogramming, leveraging advanced design space exploration (DSE) strategies like Bayesian optimization to automate both top-down and bottom-up design flows. Hence, we reduce the need for manual intervention and domain expertise. In addition, the framework introduces customizable optimization, transformation, and control blocks to enhance DNN accelerator performance and resource efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate up to a 92\% DSP and 89\% LUT usage reduction for select networks, while preserving accuracy, along with a 15.6-fold reduction in optimization time compared to grid search. These results highlight the potential for automating the generation of resource-efficient DNN accelerator designs with minimum effort.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.05850v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] VeriRAG: A Retrieval-Augmented Framework for Automated RTL Testability Repair</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15664</link><description>arXiv:2507.15664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense potential in computer-aided design (CAD), particularly for automated debugging and verification within electronic design automation (EDA) tools. However, Design for Testability (DFT) remains a relatively underexplored area. This paper presents VeriRAG, the first LLM-assisted DFT-EDA framework. VeriRAG leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to enable LLM to revise code to ensure DFT compliance. VeriRAG integrates (1) an autoencoder-based similarity measurement model for precise retrieval of reference RTL designs for the LLM, and (2) an iterative code revision pipeline that allows the LLM to ensure DFT compliance while maintaining synthesizability. To support VeriRAG, we introduce VeriDFT, a Verilog-based DFT dataset curated for DFT-aware RTL repairs. VeriRAG retrieves structurally similar RTL designs from VeriDFT, each paired with a rigorously validated correction, as references for code repair. With VeriRAG and VeriDFT, we achieve fully automated DFT correction -- resulting in a 7.72-fold improvement in successful repair rate compared to the zero-shot baseline (Fig. 5 in Section V). Ablation studies further confirm the contribution of each component of the VeriRAG framework.

Abstract: Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) have emerged as a powerful tool for secure and privacy-preserving computation. ZKPs enable one party to convince another of a statement's validity without revealing anything else. This capability has profound implications in many domains, including machine learning, blockchain, image authentication, and electronic voting. Despite their potential, ZKPs have seen limited deployment because of their exceptionally high computational overhead, which manifests primarily during proof generation. To mitigate these overheads, a (growing) body of researchers has proposed hardware accelerators and GPU implementations of both kernels and complete protocols. Prior art spans a wide variety of ZKP schemes that vary significantly in computational overhead, proof size, verifier cost, protocol setup, and trust. The latest and widely used ZKP protocols are intentionally designed to balance these trade-offs. One particular challenge in modern ZKP systems is supporting complex, high-degree gates using the SumCheck protocol. We address this challenge with a novel programmable accelerator to efficiently handle arbitrary custom gates via SumCheck. Our accelerator achieves upwards of $1000\times$ geomean speedup over CPU-based SumChecks across a range of gate types. We include this unit in zkPHIRE, a programmable, full-system accelerator that accelerates the HyperPlonk protocol. zkPHIRE achieves $1486\times$ geomean speedup over CPU and $11.87\times$ geomean speedup over the state-of-the-art at iso-area. Together, these results demonstrate compelling performance while scaling to large problem sizes (upwards of $2^{30}$ constraints) and maintaining small proof sizes ($4-5$ KB).</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.16738v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Parameterized Hardware Design with Latency-Abstract Interfaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02570</link><description>arXiv:2401.02570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hardware designs must use latency-insensitive (LI) interfaces when timing is input-dependent. When timing is input-independent, designs should use latency-sensitive (LS) interfaces for maximum performance. However, designs commonly use LI interfaces to integrate with externally generated LS modules--from, e.g., IP generators, high-level synthesis, or domain specific languages. In every fully integrated design, such uses of LI represent pure overhead. The challenge is that generators can dramatically change timing interfaces of the modules to meet performance objectives, and LI interfaces act as a useful design abstraction and enable timing adaptation.
  We define latency-abstract (LA) interfaces, a new design abstraction, which provide the timing adaptability of LI interfaces at design-time and the efficient integration of LS interfaces. LA interfaces use output parameters, a novel compile-time mechanism for child modules to return values parent modules, to abstract and encapsulate timing behaviors at design time. During design elaboration, LA interfaces are compiled into efficient LS interfaces based on parameter values. While an attractive option, LA interfaces inherit the complexities of parameterized hardware design: the user must reason how parameters influence timing behaviors of modules and ensure that designs adapt to interface changes. To address this challenge and demonstrate the utility of LA interfaces, we design Lilac, a parameterized HDL that uses a type system track the influence of parameters on timing behaviors and formally guarantee that every parameterization of an LA design results in a circuit without structural hazards.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2401.02570v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Confidential Computing on Heterogeneous CPU-GPU Systems: Survey and Future Directions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11601</link><description>arXiv:2408.11601v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the widespread informatization and rapid data explosion have increased the demand for high-performance heterogeneous systems that integrate multiple computing cores such as CPUs, Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The combination of CPU and GPU is particularly popular due to its versatility. However, these heterogeneous systems face significant security and privacy risks. Advances in privacy-preserving techniques, especially hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), offer effective protection for GPU applications. Nonetheless, the potential security risks involved in extending TEEs to GPUs in heterogeneous systems remain uncertain and need further investigation. To investigate these risks in depth, we study the existing popular GPU TEE designs and summarize and compare their key implications. Additionally, we review existing powerful attacks on GPUs and traditional TEEs deployed on CPUs, along with the efforts to mitigate these threats. We identify potential attack surfaces introduced by GPU TEEs and provide insights into key considerations for designing secure GPU TEEs. This survey is timely as new TEEs for heterogeneous systems, particularly GPUs, are being developed, highlighting the need to understand potential security threats and build both efficient and secure systems.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2408.11601v3</guid></item><item><title>[Nature] Social-media bans: why corporate fines could backfire</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00262-z</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature, Published online: 27 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00262-z"&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-026-00262-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Social-media bans: why corporate fines could backfire</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00262-z</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Oligoprotein type I interferon signatures, but not &lt;i&gt;TREX1&lt;/i&gt; variants, increase risk of systemic lupus erythematosus in UK Biobank</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67832-z</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 27 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67832-z"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-025-67832-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Genetic variants of TREX1, a negative regulator of type I interferon responses, have been linked previously to non-monogenic systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Mutations in YIPF5 cause MEDS2 (microcephaly, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes syndrome), a fatal disorder manifesting in early childhood. We demonstrate that YIPF5 is involved in ER export of a subset of proteins, including cargoes of the ER-export receptor SURF4, with which it directly interacts. YIPF5 knockout cells display altered cell surface and secretome profiles, with reduced neuronal adhesion molecules and increased secretion of ER chaperones affecting migration.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00166-5?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] ToPolyAgent: AI Agents for Coarse-Grained Bead-Spring Topological Polymer Simulations</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00471C</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, Accepted Manuscript&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00471C, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Lijie Ding, Jan Michael Y.

Following MI, the heart undergoes remodelling leading to heart failure. The Hippo pathway is a major regulator of cell growth and survival in cardiomyocytes. Here we show that serotonin receptor 2B (5-HT2B) regulates Hippo pathway in cardiomyocytes and modulates heart remodelling following MI. 5-HT2B expression significantly enhanced the Hippo pathway effector Yes-associated protein (YAP) activity resulting in increased cardiomyocyte proliferation and decreased apoptosis.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00200-2?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Protective role of PASH-1 in CGG repeat-driven RNA and protein toxicity in FXTAS</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00187-2?rss=yes</link><description>Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is caused by CGG repeat expansions in FMR1, leading to RNA toxicity and toxic FMRpolyG peptide from abnormal translation. Using a Caenorhabditis elegans model, we generated single-copy insertions of the human FMR1 5’ UTR containing 0, 16, or 99 CGG repeats under a pan-neuronal promoter. Worms expressing 99 CGG repeats showed impaired motility, altered neuronal morphology, and disrupted miRNA homeostasis. Co-expression of PASH-1, the C. elegans ortholog of a miRNA-processing DGCR8 sequestered in FXTAS, mitigated both RNA- and peptide-mediated toxicity, restoring locomotion, neuronal structure, and miRNA regulation balance.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00187-2?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Cord Serum Metabolic Signatures Associated with Neonatal Anthropometry and Neurodevelopment Through Age Two in Twins</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00184-7?rss=yes</link><description>Conventional singleton studies struggle to disentangle environmental from genetic influences on phenotypes. This twin study (n=129 pairs) leveraged within-pair comparisons to clarify these influences on early development. At the population level, we identified 130 cord serum metabolites associated with neonatal anthropometry and neurodevelopment up to 24 months. Monozygotic and dizygotic comparisons showed that metabolite associations with fetal growth measures (e.g., birth weight) were genetically influenced, whereas links to 6-month fine motor skills reflected non-shared intrauterine factors, especially unequal placental sharing.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00184-7?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Robust effector memory features of human T-bethi B cells induced by repeated mRNA vaccination</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00179-3?rss=yes</link><description>The heterogeneity of memory B cells in response to repetitive cognate antigen challenges remains to be fully elucidated. Here we identified a transcriptionally distinct cluster of T-bethi B cells, among SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific B cells in PBMCs from healthy individuals vaccinated with the BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. Our findings indicate that T-bethi B cells can be defined by a combination of CD11c and FcRL5 receptors, and are distinguished by distinct gene regulatory networks associated with effector functions.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid

Abstract: Magnetic topological materials are a class of compounds which can host massless electrons controlled by the magnetic order. One such compound is EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$, which has recently garnered interest due to its strong interplay between the Eu magnetism and charge carriers. However the topology of the electronic band structure, which depends on the ground state magnetic configuration of the europium sublattice, has not been determined. Based on our \textit{ab-initio} calculations, we find that an in-plane and out-of-plane \textit{A}-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) order generates a topological crystalline insulator and Dirac semimetal respectively, whereas a ferromagnetic (FM) order stabilizes a Weyl semimetal. Our resonant x-ray elastic scattering measurements of single-crystal thin film EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$ reveal both a sharp magnetic peak at $\textit{\textbf{Q}}$=$(0,0,\frac{1}{2})$ and broad $\textit{\textbf{Q}}$=$(0,0,1)$ below $T_{\mathrm{N}}=12.9$\,K, which is associated with an \textit{A}-type AFM and FM order, respectively. Our measurements indicate that the FM and AFM layers are spatially separated along the crystal $c$ axis, with the former limited to the top three atomic layers. We propose that EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$ behaves as a Weyl semimetal in the surface FM layers, and as a topological crystalline insulator in the lower AFM layers.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16365v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Photoinduced metastable cation disorder in metal halide double perovskites</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16404</link><description>arXiv:2601.16404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead-free perovskites have emerged as environmentally benign alternatives to lead-halide counterparts for optoelectronics. Among them, the double perovskite Cs2AgInCl6 family exhibits remarkable white-light emission with proper composition engineering, enabled by strong electron-phonon coupling and the formation of self-trapped excitons (STEs). Despite these advantages, the fundamental photo- and structural dynamics governing their excited-state behavior remain poorly understood. Here, we report a long-lived metastable phase in the Cs2AgInCl6 double perovskite family and unravel this process and the concomitant electronic and structural evolution using a suite of tools including transient optical spectroscopy, time-resolved X-ray diffraction (TR-XRD) and X-ray absorption (TR-XAS). We show that the photoinduced, transient metastable phase is associated with B-site (Ag-In) disorder, which induces a dramatically reduced optical bandgap. Supported by TR-XRD and first-principles calculations, the Ag-In disorder drives the formation of Ag-rich and In-rich domains with millisecond lifetimes, with lifetimes increasing at lower temperatures. TR-XAS further reveals that photogenerated STEs oxidize Ag+ to Ag2+, facilitating this highly temporally asymmetric order-disorder transition. Our findings demonstrate a new mechanism, mediated by hole-localized STE formation, that enables prolongation of transient light-induced states to the multi-millisecond regime in double perovskites, opening possibilities to harvesting the functional properties of metastable phases of these materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16404v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Distinguishing Hot-Electron and Optomechanical Pathways at Metal-Molecule Interfaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16445</link><description>arXiv:2601.16445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy and charge transfer between molecules and metal surfaces underpin heterogeneous catalysis, surface-enhanced spectroscopies and plasmon-driven chemistry, yet the microscopic origins of vibrational excitation at metal interfaces remain unresolved. Here we use temperature-dependent surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) to directly distinguish plasmon-vibration optomechanical coupling from hot-electron-driven excitation.By probing thionine adsorbed on gold nanostructures at 295 K and 3.5 K, we show that pronounced anti-Stokes scattering at cryogenic temperature arises from optical pumping of vibrational populations, whereas room-temperature spectra are governed by thermal population. Bromide co-adsorbates play a decisive role by guiding molecular alignment, inducing surface atom displacements, and enabling transient adsorption geometries that activate otherwise Raman-inactive vibrational modes. In the absence of bromide, distinct excitation pathways emerge, reflecting competition between optomechanical coupling and charge-transfer processes associated with molecular polarization along the optical field or orientation relative to the metal surface. These results establish molecular optomechanics as a sensitive probe of surface-molecule interactions and demonstrate how anion-mediated surface dynamics regulate energy flow at plasmonic interfaces.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16445v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A low-tech solution to process entire metal/molecule heterostructure stacks into vertical nanopillar electronic devices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16481</link><description>arXiv:2601.16481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum technologies aim to assemble devices whose operation is controlled by the quantum state of individual atoms. Achieving this level of control in a practical, scalable design remains, however, a major obstacle to mass societal adoption. By working at the level of interatomic bonding, molecular engineering has enabled exquisite control over the electronic properties of individual atoms and their interactions with neighboring atoms. This positions molecular electronics as a potentially disruptive quantum technology, but serious technological challenges have prevented it from being included in technical road maps. The main obstacle is that conventional, mass scalable nanodevice technologies utilize resists and solvents that can degrade molecules. Some approaches involve exposing junction interfaces to contaminants (e.g. air, resist etc...), which can be particularly problematic for spintronics. In this technical paper, we present our decade-long work into building a nanotechnological chain that can process entire metal/molecule heterostructures into vertical nanopillars electronic devices. We discuss the advantages and pitfalls of the various iterations of this process that were implemented. We also discuss outlooks for this unique technology.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16481v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Electronic structure, phase stability, and transport properties of the AlTiVCr lightweight high-entropy alloy: A computational study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16528</link><description>arXiv:2601.16528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics and phase stability of the AlTiVCr lightweight high-entropy alloy using a combination of ab initio electronic structure calculations, a concentration wave analysis, and atomistic Monte Carlo simulations. In alignment both with experimental data and with results obtained using other computational approaches, we predict a $\textrm{B2}$ (CsCl) chemical ordering emerging in this alloy at comparatively high temperatures, which is driven by Al and Ti moving to separate sublattices, while V and Cr express weaker site preferences. The impact of this $\textrm{B2}$ chemical ordering on the electronic transport properties of the alloy is investigated within a Kubo-Greenwood linear response framework and it is found that, counter-intuitively, the alloy's residual resistivity increases as the material transitions from the $\textrm{A2}$ (disordered bcc) phase to our predicted $\textrm{B2}$ (partially) ordered structure. This is understood to result primarily from a reduction in the density of electronic states at the Fermi level induced by the chemical ordering. At low temperatures, our atomistic Monte Carlo simulations then reveal subsequent sublattice orderings, with the ground-state configuration predicted to be a fully-ordered, single-phase structure with vanishing associated residual resistivity. These results give fresh, insight into the atomic-scale structure and consequent physical properties of this well-studied, technologically relevant material.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16528v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Synergistic effects of ferromagnetic elements and LAGP solid electrolyte in suppressing and trapping polysulfide shuttle transfers in lithium-sulfur batteries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16544</link><description>arXiv:2601.16544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large - scale commercialization of promising lithium - sulfur (Li - S) batteries remains limited by the polysulfide shuttle effect, which causes rapid capacity fading and poor cycle life. In this study, we present a scalable strategy to mitigate this challenge by modifying polyethylene (PE) separators with ferromagnetic and solid - state ionic coatings. Thin films of nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), and the Li - ion - conducting ceramic Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 (LAGP) were deposited via ion beam sputtering, while Ni ion implantation was also employed to modify the PE substrate. The electrochemical performance of pristine and modified separators was evaluated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and staircase voltammetry (SV) in liquid electrolyte within H - cell configurations. Surface morphology and elemental composition were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS). The results show that LAGP-based coatings significantly enhance separator stability and effectively suppress polysulfide diffusion, leading to lower redox peak intensities and improved cycling performance. In contrast, Ni coatings exhibited poor long - term stability, likely due to parasitic reactions or delamination during its life time. The combined LAGP/Co architecture provided the most effective suppression of the polysulfide shuttle, attributed to synergistic ionic and catalytic effects that promote interfacial stability and selective ion transport. Ni implantation into PE showed only a negligible effect. This study highlights the potential of integrating solid ionic conductors with ferromagnetic layers to design multifunctional separators for high-performance Li - S batteries.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16544v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Simulation of the carbon dioxide hydrate-water interfacial energy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16653</link><description>arXiv:2601.16653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon dioxide hydrates are ice-like nonstoichiometric inclusion solid compounds with importance to global climate change, and gas transportation and storage. The thermodynamic and kinetic mechanisms that control carbon dioxide nucleation critically depend on hydrate-water interfacial free energy. Interfacial energies show large uncertainties due to the conditions at which experiments are performed. Under these circumstances, we hypothesize that accurate molecular models for water and carbon dioxide combined with computer simulation tools can offer an alternative but complementary way to estimate interfacial energies at coexistence conditions from a molecular perspective. We have evaluated the interfacial free energy of carbon dioxide hydrates at coexistence conditions (three-phase equilibrium or dissociation line) implementing advanced computational methodologies, including the novel Mold Integration methodology. Our calculations are based on the definition of the interfacial free energy, standard statistical thermodynamic techniques, and the use of the most reliable and used molecular models for water (TIP4P/Ice) and carbon dioxide (TraPPE) available in the literature. We find that simulations provide an interfacial energy value, at coexistence conditions, consistent with the experiments from its thermodynamic definition. Our calculations are reliable since are based on the use of two molecular models that accurately predict: (1) The ice-water interfacial free energy; and (2) the dissociation line of carbon dioxide hydrates. Computer simulation predictions provide alternative but reliable estimates of the carbon dioxide interfacial energy. Our pioneering work demonstrates that is possible to predict interfacial energies of hydrates from a truly computational molecular perspective and opens a new door to the determination of free energies of hydrates.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16653v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Doping-dependent orbital magnetism in Chromium pnictides</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16908</link><description>arXiv:2601.16908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results for the phase diagram of the parent compound LaCrAsO under electron doping using the matrix random-phase approximation. At low doping levels, the system stabilizes an antiferromagnetic state in which different Cr sublattices carry opposite spins, consistent with experimental observations. As the doping concentration increases, a stripe-type antiferromagnetic phase becomes favored. At even higher doping, the system repeats the two former magnetic states, but with incommensurate magnetic ordering vectors. The commensurate magnetic phases are associated with more localized electrons in the Cr $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital, whereas the incommensurate phases are linked to the $d_{xy}$ orbital, whose stronger overlap favors itinerant-electron magnetism.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16908v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Fractional Order Thermo Piezoelectric Modelling of qP Wave Interaction and Energy Partition at Welded Interface</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16223</link><description>arXiv:2601.16223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An analytical model is developed to investigate the interaction of quasi longitudinal (qP) waves with a perfectly bonded interface between a thermo piezoelectric half space and a functionally graded piezoelectric half space. The formulation is based on the fractional order Lord Shulman generalized thermoelasticity theory, which provides an enhanced description of coupled thermo electro mechanical wave behaviour. Rotational effects are incorporated into the constitutive relations and equations of motion for both media, while the lower half space is assumed to be subjected to initial stress. Closed form solutions for reflection and transmission coefficients are obtained, together with associated energy partition factors, allowing a comprehensive assessment of interface wave characteristics. Numerical simulations carried out using MATLAB demonstrate that the reflection and transmission responses are strongly influenced by initial stress, fractional order parameter, and thermal relaxation time. The calculated energy ratios of scattered waves satisfy the energy conservation condition, confirming the mathematical consistency of the formulation. The findings of this study are relevant to the design and analysis of smart sensors, rotating and aerospace structures, vibration control systems, and energy harvesting devices employing functionally graded thermo piezoelectric materials under fractional order effects.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16223v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] D-MODD: A Diffusion Model of Opinion Dynamics Derived from Online Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16226</link><description>arXiv:2601.16226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first empirical derivation of a continuous-time stochastic model for real-world opinion dynamics. Using longitudinal social-media data to infer users opinion on a binary climate-change topic, we reconstruct the underlying drift and diffusion functions governing individual opinion updates. We show that the observed dynamics are well described by a Langevin-type stochastic differential equation, with persistent attractor basins and spatially sensitive drift and diffusion terms. The empirically inferred one-step transition probabilities closely reproduce the transition kernel generated from the D-MODD model we introduce. Our results provide the first direct evidence that online opinion dynamics on a polarized topic admit a Markovian description at the operator level, with empirically reconstructed transition kernels accurately reproduced by a data-driven Langevin model, bridging sociophysics, behavioral data, and complex-systems modeling.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16226v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Experimental observation of conformal field theory spectra</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16275</link><description>arXiv:2601.16275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal field theories (CFTs) feature prominently in high-energy physics, statistical mechanics, and condensed matter. For example, CFTs govern emergent universal properties of systems tuned to quantum phase transitions, including their entanglement, correlations, and low-energy excitation spectra. Much of the rich structure predicted by CFTs nevertheless remains unobserved in experiment. Here we directly observe the energy excitation spectra of emergent CFTs at quantum phase transitions -- recovering universal energy ratios characteristic of the underlying field theories. Specifically, we develop and implement a modulation technique to resolve a Rydberg chain's finite-size spectra, variably tuned to quantum phase transitions described by either Ising or tricritical Ising CFTs. We also employ local control to distinguish parities of excitations under reflection and, in the tricritical Ising chain, to induce transitions between distinct CFT spectra associated with changing boundary conditions. By utilizing a variant of the modulation technique, we furthermore study the dynamical structure factor of the critical system, which is closely related to the correlation of an underlying Ising conformal field. Our work not only probes the emergence of CFT features in a quantum simulator, but also provides a technique for diagnosing a priori unknown universality classes in future experiments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16275v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Valley-dependent topological interface states in biased armchair nanoribbons of gapless single-layer graphene for transport applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05653</link><description>arXiv:2510.05653v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Valley-dependent topological physics offers a promising avenue for designing nanoscale devices based on gapless single-layer graphene. To demonstrate this potential, we investigate an electrical bias-controlled topological discontinuity in valley polarization within a two-segment armchair nanoribbon of gapless single-layer graphene. This discontinuity is created at the interface by applying opposite in-plane, transverse electrical biases to the two segments. An efficient tight-binding theoretical formulation is developed to calculate electron states in the structure. In a reference configuration, we obtain energy eigenvalues and probability distributions that feature interface-confined electron eigenstates induced by the topological discontinuity. Moreover, to elucidate the implications of interface confinement for electron transport, a modified configuration is introduced to transform the eigenstates into transport-active, quasi-localized ones. We show that such states result in Fano "anti-resonances" in transmission spectra. The resilience of these quasi-localized states and their associated Fano fingerprints is examined with respect to fluctuations. Finally, a proof-of-concept band-stop electron energy filter is presented, highlighting the potential of this confinement mechanism and, more broadly, valley-dependent topological physics in designing nanoscale devices in gapless single-layer graphene.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.05653v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Finite-temperature topological transitions in the presence of quenched uncorrelated disorder</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12001</link><description>arXiv:2601.12001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address issues related to the presence of defects at finite-temperature topological transitions, in particular when defects are modeled in terms of further variables associated with a quenched disorder, corresponding to the limit in which the defect dynamics is very slow. As a paradigmatic model, we consider the classical three-dimensional lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge model in the presence of quenched uncorrelated disorder associated with the plaquettes of the lattice, whose topological transitions are characterized by the absence of a local order parameter. We study the critical behaviors in the presence of weak disorder. We show that they belong to a new topological universality class, different from that of the lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge models without disorder, in agreement with the Harris criterium for the relevance of uncorrelated quenched disorder when the pure system undergoes a continuous transition with positive specific-heat critical exponent.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12001v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Integral Transforms for Finite Gauge Theory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00117</link><description>arXiv:2312.00117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper shows that quantization of $\pi$-finite spaces, as a functor out of a higher category of spans, is equivariant in two ways: Symmetries of a given polarization/Lagrangian always induce coherent symmetries of the quantization. On the other hand, symmetries of the entire phase space a priori only induce projective symmetries, with an invertible once-categorified theory, the anomaly theory, encoding the projectivity.
  We give projective symmetries of three-dimensional finite gauge theories a concrete description via a twice-categorified analogue of Blattner-Kostant-Sternberg kernels and the associated integral transforms, such as the Fourier transform. This establishes an analogy between certain instances of the $\pi$-finite quantization procedure considered herein and the geometric quantization of a symplectic vector space.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2312.00117v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Disentangling Boltzmann brains, the time-asymmetry of memory, and the second law</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10959</link><description>arXiv:2507.10959v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Are your perceptions, memories and observational data, a statistical fluctuation out of the thermal equilibrium of the universe, having no correlation with the actual past state of the universe? Arguments are given in the literature for and against this "Boltzmann brain" hypothesis. Complicating these arguments have been the many subtle -- and very often implicit -- joint dependencies among these arguments and others that have been given for the past hypothesis, the second law, and even for Bayesian inference of the reliability of experimental data. These dependencies can easily lead to circular reasoning. To avoid this problem, since all of these arguments involve the stochastic properties of the dynamics of the universe's entropy, we begin by formalizing that dynamics as a time-symmetric, time-translation invariant Markov process, which we call the entropy conjecture. Crucially, like all stochastic processes, the entropy conjecture does not specify any time(s) which it should be conditioned on in order to infer the stochastic dynamics of our universe's entropy. Any such choice of conditioning times and associated entropy values must be introduced as an independent assumption. This observation allows us to disentangle the standard Boltzmann brain hypothesis, its "1000CE" variant, the past hypothesis, the second law, and the reliability of our experimental data, all in a fully formal manner. In particular, we show that these all make an arbitrary assumption that the dynamics of the universe's entropy should be conditioned on a single event at a single moment in time, differing only in the details of their assumptions. In this aspect, the Boltzmann brain hypothesis and the second law are equally legitimate (or not).</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.10959v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Information Propagation in Predator-Prey Dynamics of Turbulent Plasma</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05127</link><description>arXiv:2508.05127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetically confined fusion plasmas exhibit predator-prey-like cyclic oscillations through the self-regulating interaction between drift-wave turbulence and zonal flow. To elucidate the detailed mechanism and causality underlying this phenomenon, we construct a simple stochastic predator-prey model that incorporates intrinsic fluctuations and analyze its statistical properties from an information-theoretic perspective. We first show that the model exhibits persistent fluctuating cyclic oscillations called quasi-cycles due to amplification of intrinsic noise. This result suggests the possibility that the previously observed periodic oscillations in a toroidal plasma are not limit cycles but quasi-cycles, and that such quasi-cycles may be widely observed under various conditions. For this model, we further prove that information of the zonal flow is propagated to turbulence. This result suggests that turbulence behavior may be predictable to a certain extent based on zonal flow characteristics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.05127v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Geometric Categories for Continuous Gauging</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08254</link><description>arXiv:2511.08254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified categorical framework for gauging both continuous and finite symmetries in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. Our construction applies to geometric categories i.e. categories internal to stacks. This generalizes the familiar setting of fusion categories, which describe finite group symmetries, to the case of Lie group symmetries. Within this framework, we obtain a functorial Symmetry Topological Field Theory together with its natural boundaries, allowing us to compute associated endomorphism categories and Drinfeld centers in a uniform way. For a given symmetry group $G$, our framework recovers the electric and magnetic higher-form symmetries expected in $G$-gauge theory. Moreover, it naturally encodes electric breaking symmetry in the presence of charged matter, reproducing known physical phenomena in a categorical setting.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.08254v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] A High Performance and Efficient Post-Quantum Crypto-Processor for FrodoKEM</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16500</link><description>arXiv:2601.16500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: FrodoKEM is a lattice-based post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism (KEM). It has been considered for standardization by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) due to its robust security profile. However, its hardware implementation exhibits a weakness of high latency and heavy resource burden, hindering its practical application. Moreover, diverse usage scenarios call for comprehensive functionality. To address these challenges, this paper presents a high-performance and efficient crypto-processor for FrodoKEM. A multiple-instruction overlapped execution scheme is introduced to enable efficient multi-module scheduling and minimize operational latency. Furthermore, a high-speed, reconfigurable parallel multiplier array is integrated to handle intensive matrix computations under diverse computation patterns, significantly enhancing hardware efficiency. In addition, a compact memory scheduling strategy shortens the lifespan of intermediate matrices, thereby reducing overall storage requirements. The proposed design provides full support for all FrodoKEM security levels and protocol phases. It consumes 13467 LUTs, 6042 FFs, and 14 BRAMs on an Artix-7 FPGA and achieves the fastest reported execution time. Compared with state-of-the-art hardware implementations, our design improves the area-time product (ATP) by 1.75-2.00 times.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16500v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] SAGe: A Lightweight Algorithm-Architecture Co-Design for Mitigating the Data Preparation Bottleneck in Large-Scale Genome Sequence Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03732</link><description>arXiv:2504.03732v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Genome sequence analysis, which examines the DNA sequences of organisms, drives advances in many critical medical and biotechnological fields. Given its importance and the exponentially growing volumes of genomic sequence data, there are extensive efforts to accelerate genome sequence analysis. In this work, we demonstrate a major bottleneck that greatly limits and diminishes the benefits of state-of-the-art genome sequence analysis accelerators: the data preparation bottleneck, where genomic sequence data is stored in compressed form and needs to be first decompressed and formatted before an accelerator can operate on it. To mitigate this bottleneck, we propose SAGe, an algorithm-architecture co-design for highly-compressed storage and high-performance access of large-scale genomic sequence data. The key challenge is to improve data preparation performance while maintaining high compression ratios (comparable to genomic-specific compression algorithms) at low hardware cost. We address this challenge by leveraging key properties of genomic datasets to co-design (i) a lossless (de)compression algorithm, (ii) hardware that decompresses data with lightweight operations and efficient streaming accesses, (iii) storage data layout, and (iv) interface commands to access data. SAGe is highly versatile, as it supports datasets from different sequencing technologies and species. Due to its lightweight design, SAGe can be seamlessly integrated with a broad range of hardware accelerators for genome sequence analysis to mitigate their data preparation bottlenecks. Our results demonstrate that SAGe improves the average end-to-end performance and energy efficiency of two state-of-the-art genome sequence analysis accelerators by 3.0x-32.1x and 13.0x-34.0x, respectively, compared to when the accelerators rely on state-of-the-art software and hardware decompression tools.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.03732v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] LaZagna: An Open-Source Framework for Flexible 3D FPGA Architectural Exploration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05579</link><description>arXiv:2505.05579v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While 3D IC technology has been extensively explored for ASICs, their application to FPGAs remains limited. Existing studies on 3D FPGAs are often constrained to fixed prototypes, narrow architectural templates, and simulation-only evaluations. In this work, we present LaZagna, the first open-source framework for automated, end-to-end 3D FPGA architecture generation and evaluation. LaZagna supports high-level architectural specification, synthesizable RTL generation, and bitstream production, enabling comprehensive validation of 3D FPGA designs beyond simulation. It significantly broadens the design space compared to prior work by introducing customizable vertical interconnect patterns, novel 3D switch block designs, and support for heterogeneous logic layers. The framework also incorporates practical design constraints such as inter-layer via density and vertical interconnect delay. We demonstrate the capabilities of LaZagna by generating synthesizable RTL that can be taken through full physical design flows for fabric generation, along with functionally correct bitstreams. Furthermore, we conduct five case studies that explore various architectural parameters and evaluate their impact on wirelength, critical path delay, and routing runtime. These studies showcase the framework's scalability, flexibility, and effectiveness in guiding future 3D FPGA architectural and packaging decisions. LaZagna is fully open-source and available on GitHub.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.05579v4</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Relational Hoare Logic for High-Level Synthesis of Hardware Accelerators</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09217</link><description>arXiv:2601.09217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-level synthesis (HLS) is a powerful tool for developing efficient hardware accelerators that rely on specialized memory systems to achieve sufficient on-chip data reuse and off-chip bandwidth utilization. However, even with HLS, designing such systems still requires careful manual tuning, as automatic optimizations provided by existing tools are highly sensitive to programming style and often lack transparency. To address these issues, we present a formal translation framework based on relational Hoare logic, which enables robust and transparent transformations. Our method recognizes complex memory access patterns in na\"ive HLS programs and automatically transforms them by inserting on-chip buffers to enforce linear access to off-chip memory, and by replacing non-sequential processing with stream processing, while preserving program semantics. Experiments using our prototype translator, combined with an off-the-shelf HLS compiler and a real FPGA board, have demonstrated significant performance improvements.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09217v2</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Materials] How charge frustration causes ion ordering and microphase separation at surfaces</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-025-02467-5</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Materials, Published online: 26 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-025-02467-5"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41563-025-02467-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Atomic force microscopy is used to investigate the adsorption and organization of ions on charged surfaces.

A precise determination of its electronic levels is essential for device-specific material-engineering. In this study, we report on the experimental determination of the ionization energy of the substitutional oxygen donor O&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; in sputter-deposited and subsequently high-temperature annealed AlN templates using temperature-dependent and time-resolved cathodoluminescence spectroscopy. The slow component of the oxygen-related defect luminescence, associated with donor–acceptor pair recombination and with decay times of hundreds of nanoseconds, exhibits distinct thermal quenching at temperatures above 250 K. By fitting this temperature dependence with a model based on the thermal emission of electrons from the donor level, we extract an ionization energy &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;ED&lt;/span&gt; = 371 ± 77 meV for the oxygen donor in AlN. This experimental value is in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions for the shallow substitutional O&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; donor and clearly distinct from calculated energies for the deeper oxygen DX center. This work provides an important experimental insight into this fundamental parameter in AlN.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/4/042101/3378097/Ionization-energy-of-the-oxygen-donor-in-AlN</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Integrated AlGaAs/GaAs betavoltaic arrays with low self-discharge LiCoO 2  batteries for efficient β-energy conversion and storage</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/4/043901/3378086/Integrated-AlGaAs-GaAs-betavoltaic-arrays-with-low</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Nuclear batteries are emerging power devices that convert radioactive decay energy into electricity. In this study, we developed a six-layer AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructure betavoltaic cell array by serially connecting six monocells on a single printed circuit board substrate, and a low-self-discharge Li-ion battery was integrated into the nuclear energy conversion and storage system. Through dual strategies of electrode modification and electrolyte optimization, we constructed an efficient hybrid energy conversion and storage system. To address self-discharge under microcurrent charging, two approaches were implemented: (1) constructing graphene-based conductive networks within LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathodes to reduce interfacial impedance via face-contact mechanisms, suppress Co&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; dissolution, and accelerate Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion; (2) incorporating fumaronitrile additive into the electrolyte to preferentially form stable cathode electrolyte interphase films, thereby inhibiting electrolyte decomposition and metal-ion catalyzed side reactions. These strategies suppressed self-discharge via physical/chemical pathways.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/4/043901/3378086/Integrated-AlGaAs-GaAs-betavoltaic-arrays-with-low</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] T-Cell “Rejuvenation” Nanovaccine: Enhancing Immunological Memory and Antitumor Responses through Telomere Extension</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c21977</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c21977/asset/images/medium/ja5c21977_0008.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c21977&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 18:07:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c21977</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] C–H Insertion Functionalization of Polyolefins for Versatile Polyolefin-Polyester Compatibilization</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c20245</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c20245/asset/images/medium/ja5c20245_0005.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c20245&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 13:00:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c20245</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Science: Table of Contents] Loss of SOCS1 in Donor T Cells Exacerbates Intestinal GVHD by Driving a Chemokine‐Dependent Pro‐Inflammatory Immune Microenvironment</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202513735?af=R</link><description>Advanced Science, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Science: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 08:39:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/advs.202513735</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Correction to “Regio- and Stereoselective Halogenation by an Iron(II)- and 2-Oxoglutarate-Dependent Halogenase in the Biosynthesis of Halogenated Nucleosides”</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c23050</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c23050&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 19:59:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c23050</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Ambimodal (2 + 1)/(4 + 1) Pseudopericyclic Transition States in Reactions between Dihalocarbenes and Olefins</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c13906</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c13906/asset/images/medium/ja5c13906_0008.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c13906&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 14:24:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c13906</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Replicative senescence induction in single cells is not predicted by telomere length, dysfunction, or oxidation</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00176-8?rss=yes</link><description>The accumulation of senescent cells during aging contributes to age-associated diseases. Current models posit that replicative senescence is driven by telomere dysfunction, including telomere shortening, telomere-associated DNA damage response (DDR), and telomere oxidation. Here, we first show that aging primary human fibroblasts gradually increase the time spent in a CDK2-low non-cycling state and increase senescence biomarker expression. We then evaluate telomere features as single-cell senescence biomarkers in a workflow linking high-throughput, long-term time-lapse imaging with confocal imaging to map cell-cycle dynamics to telomere features in the same cell.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00176-8?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Cancer-associated fibroblasts as a critical driver in tumor metastasis: the mechanisms and future perspectives</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00163-X?rss=yes</link><description>Tumor metastasis represents a lethal event for patients due to the lack of effective treatments. Compared with primary tumors, the components of tumor microenvironment (TME) of metastatic tumors are different. Tumor cells alone are unable to metastasize. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as one major component of TME drive tumor metastasis. In metastatic lesions, the proportion of CAFs is significantly higher and are spatially close to tumor cells with high metastatic potential. CAFs themselves are resistant to chemoradiotherapy and have strong invasive ability based on their major role in degrading extracellular matrix (ECM).</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00163-X?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Disrupted gut microbiome networks and unhealthy behaviors predict metabolic dysfunction in children and adolescents in the long term</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00138-0?rss=yes</link><description>We recently showed that the individual gut microbiome (GM) configuration in children and adolescents, together with long-term dietary habits, can predict the development of obesity.

Abstract: We derive an analytical expression for the propagator and the transition path time distribution of a two-dimensional active Brownian particle crossing a parabolic barrier with absorbing boundary conditions at both sides. By taking those of a passive Brownian particle as basis states and dealing with the activity as a perturbation, our solution is expressed in terms of the perturbed eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the associated Fokker-Planck equation once the latter is reduced by taking into account only the coordinate along the direction of the barrier and the self-propulsion angle. We show that transition path times are typically shortened by the self-propulsion of the particle. Our solution also allows us to obtain the survival probability and the first-passage times distribution, which display a strong dependence on the particle's activity, while the rotational diffusivity influences them to a minor extent.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15310v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Scalar and fully relativistic pressure and temperature-dependent ab-initio thermodynamics study of simple cubic polonium</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15525</link><description>arXiv:2601.15525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ab-initio thermodynamic properties of simple cubic polonium ({\alpha}-Po) were studied within the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA), where both lattice vibrations (phonons) and electronic excitations contributions are included in the Helmholtz free energy. We investigate the influence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) by comparing the scalar relativistic (SR) and fully relativistic (FR) pseudopotentials on the thermodynamic properties of polonium and evaluate the performance of three popular exchange-correlation functionals, GGA (PBE and PBEsol), and LDA (PZ). Temperature and pressure-dependent thermodynamic properties were compared with the available experimental and theoretical studies. We found that the effect of electronic excitations is negligible for all the thermodynamic properties. LDA+SOC provides a better agreement with the experimental volume, while the thermal expansion coefficients from LDA+SOC and PBEsol + SOC closely match experimental values. SOC effects appear insignificant for the isobaric heat capacity but substantially contribute to the adiabatic bulk modulus. The phonon dispersions and mode-Gr\"uneisen parameters ({\gamma}_q{\eta}) were interpolated at the lattice constant corresponding to 301 K. The SR dispersions exhibit several anomalies in all directions, which were suppressed significantly by the inclusion of SOC. The role of SOC on the elastic constant-coefficient (C_ij) and elastic anisotropy factor at 0 K is also studied. The Pugh ratio confirmed that simple cubic polonium is ductile, and we observed that the elastic anisotropy factor and Pugh ratio decreased with increasing pressure. The effect of SOC on the Cauchy pressure is also determined.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15525v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Systematic Magnetic Structure Generation Based on Oriented Spin Space Groups: Formulation, Applications, and High-Throughput First-Principles Calculations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15735</link><description>arXiv:2601.15735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework for generating magnetic structures, inspired by the concept of oriented spin space groups (SSGs): magnetic structures are first generated as totally symmetric representations of an SSG and are then rotated such that they belong to the maximal magnetic space group of the SSG, which we term spin-symmetry-adapted (SSA) structures and oriented SSA structures, respectively. This is a natural framework to enforce fixed magnetic moment magnitudes on the symmetry-equivalent sites as well as to exploit the spin-orbit coupling (SOC)-induced hierarchy of energy scales. To examine the present scheme, we analyze the MAGNDATA database and find that 77% of the reported structures are reproducible at the SSG level, among which 82% are fully reproduced within the oriented SSG scheme, regardless of their spin-only group types or propagation vectors. To quantitatively assess computational and predictive performance, we perform spin density functional theory calculations for 283 materials, first carrying out self-consistent calculations for SSA structures without SOC, followed by fixed-charge calculations including SOC for the descendant oriented SSA structures. The experimental magnetic structures are reproduced as energetically most stable in 82% of cases at the SSG level without SOC and in 76% of cases at the oriented SSG level with SOC, showing that the fixed-charge scheme enables accurate evaluation of SOC-induced energy differences at low computational cost. The characteristic energy scale among oriented SSA structures is only $\sim$0.29 meV per magnetic atom, about 300 times smaller than that of distinct SSA structures. These results demonstrate that oriented SSG-based enumeration, combined with the two-step calculations for SSA and oriented SSA structures, provides an efficient and robust route for large-scale magnetic-structure prediction.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15735v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Graphene-based technologies for energy applications, challenges and perspectives</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15744</link><description>arXiv:2601.15744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we report on technology developments implemented into the Graphene Flagship European project for the integration of graphene and graphene-related materials (GRMs) into energy application devices. Many of the technologies investigated so far aim at producing composite materials associating graphene or GRMs with either metal or semiconducting nanocrystals or other carbon nanostructures (e.g., CNT, graphite). These composites can be used favourably as hydrogen storage materials or solar cell absorbers. They can also provide better performing electrodes for fuel cells, batteries, or supercapacitors. For photovoltaic (PV) electrodes, where thin layers and interface engineering are required, surface technologies are preferred. We are using conventional vacuum processes to integrate graphene as well as radically new approaches based on laser irradiation strategies. For each application, the potential of implemented technologies is then presented on the basis of selected experimental and modelling results. It is shown in particular how some of these technologies can maximize the benefit taken from GRM integration.

Abstract: The fluctuations are termed mesoscopic, when their typical size is essentially larger then the average distance between the nearest neighbors, while being much smaller than the overall system size. Since the features of mesoscopic fluctuations are essentially different from those of the surrounding matter, they can be interpreted as fluctuations of one phase occurring inside another host phase. In condensed matter, these fluctuations are of nanosize. They can occur in many-body systems of different nature, for instance, they are typical for condensed matter, can appear in systems of trapped atoms, and also arise in biological and social systems. A survey of the experimental evidence for the occurrence of mesoscopic fluctuations in different materials and systems is given. The main attention is paid to a general theoretical approach for describing them. Applications of the approach are also discussed.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15782v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] NASICON solid-electrolyte modification and analysis using ion and neutron beams</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15845</link><description>arXiv:2601.15845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid electrolytes (SEs) for sodium-based superionic conductors (NaSICON) are widely recognized for their excellent ionic conductivity and application in sodium based energy storage systems. While considerable effort has been made to develop thin electrolytes for all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) for lithium ions, only a few sodium-based SEs have been successfully fabricated as thin films. These thin films are particularly desirable for their reduced electrical resistance, which typically increases with the thickness of the SE. By reducing the thickness of the SEs to the nanometer scale, their ionic conductivity can be significantly enhanced. In this study, the NASICON composite was initially prepared in the form of pellets using the mixed oxide technique with a planetary ball mill and synthesized by the solid-state method at 1250 {\deg}C. The resulting pellets were used as sputtering targets in a low-energy ion facility to prepare continuous and uniform NASICON nanofilms. To explore the effect of ion implantation on the electrical properties of NASICON, the prepared films were bombarded with Ni ions at 1.1 MeV and varying fluences, using the Tandetron accelerator at the CANAM infrastructure (NPI \v{R}e\v{z}). The electrical properties of both the synthesized and implanted films were analyzed through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results, describing the impact of irradiation on NASICON's properties, are presented here.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15845v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Structural stability, electronic structure, and magnetic properties of the single-layer trilayer La3Ni2O7 polymorph</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15858</link><description>arXiv:2601.15858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A polymorph of the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 that displays an alternating single-layer (SL) and trilayer (TL; 1313) stacking pattern has recently been discovered. Signatures of superconductivity under pressure have been found in this phase. At ambient pressure, La3Ni2O7-1313 has been reported to crystallize in three different space-group symmetries Cmmm, Imma, and Fmmm. Unlike the commonly observed tilted NiO6 octahedra in perovskite nickelates, the Cmmm phase exhibits no NiO6 tilts, implying that this structural feature alone may be insufficient to give rise to superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates. Here, we employ first-principles calculations and group theory analysis to study the pressure dependence of the structural instabilities in this SL-TL La3Ni2O7 polymorph. At ambient pressure, we identify multiple unstable phonon branches in the highest symmetry (Cmmm) structure at various high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone. Distortions associated with these instabilities lead to one of the other experimentally reported space groups (Imma) that does display octahedral tilts. The magnetic tendencies indicate that the electronic structure of La3Ni2O7-1313 at ambient pressure is dominated by the TL block, as the SL is in a Mott-insulating regime. Under pressure, a tetragonal P4/mmm structure becomes stable, in agreement with experiments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15858v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Reversible viscoelasticity and irreversible elastoplasticity in the power law creep and yielding of gels and fibre network materials under stress</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15899</link><description>arXiv:2601.15899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study computationally the creep and yielding of athermal gels and fibre network materials under a constant imposed shear stress, within a minimal model of interconnected filaments with central forces in $d=2$ spatial dimensions. Each filament is assumed Hookean initially, then breaks irreversibly above a threshold strain. At early times after the imposition of a small stress, we find purely viscoelastic creep response associated with non-affine deformations within the material, with solid terminal behaviour for a network coordination $Z&gt;2d=4$ and initially floppy response for $Z&lt;4$. For a marginally connected network, $Z=4$, we find sustained power law creep with a strain rate $\dot\gamma\sim t^{-1/2}$ and strain $\gamma \sim t^{1/2}$ as a function of time $t$ after the imposition of the stress. This viscoelastic regime gives way at later times to irreversible elastoplastic creep arising from filament breakage, broadening the range of values of $Z$ and time over which power law creep occurs, compared to a network with filament breakage disallowed. This accumulating damage can weaken the network to such an extent that catastrophic material failure then occurs after a long delay, which we characterise. Finally, we consider the implications of viscoelastic versus elastoplastic deformation for the extent to which a material will recover its original shape if the load is removed after some interval of creep.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15899v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interface Spin-orbit Coupling Induced Room-temperature Ferromagnetic Insulator</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16069</link><description>arXiv:2601.16069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To achieve room-temperature ferromagnetic insulators, which are crucial candidates for next-generation dissipation-free quantum and spintronic devices, remains a significant challenge. In this study, we report the epitaxial synthesis of novel room-temperature ferromagnetic insulating thin films, achieved through the precise construction of (111)-oriented 3d/5d interfaces. Our analysis indicates that, unlike conventional doping methods, the (111)-oriented SrIrO3/La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 (SIO/LSMO) interfaces exhibit markedly enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC). This enhanced interfacial SOC strengthens the electron-phonon coupling in LSMO, thereby shortening the electronic mean free path. As a result, the intrinsic metallicity of LSMO is suppressed, giving rise to a new FMI phase that emerges between the ferromagnetic metal and paramagnetic insulator regimes of the LSMO phase diagram. Furthermore, the temperature window of the FMI state can be tuned by precisely controlling the thickness of the LSMO layers. Our study reveals a new strategy for developing ferromagnetic insulators by engineering 3d/5d interfaces and orientations, paving a way for the development of novel dissipation-free quantum and spintronic devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16069v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] High-resolution neutron diffraction determination of noncollinear antiferromagnetic order in the honeycomb magnetoelectric Fe$_{4}$Nb$_{2}$O$_{9}$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16215</link><description>arXiv:2601.16215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetoelectric systems offer potential for device applications exploiting coupled states between electric and magnetic properties. Among magnetoelectric materials, \FNO has attracted special attention because of its pronounced dielectric signal at high magnetic transition temperatures. However, the magnetic ground state, which is essential information for understanding its unusual magnetoelectricity, remains unclarified. Here, we report a noncollinear magnetic ground state of Fe$_{4}$Nb$_{2}$O$_{9}$. To examine the magnetoelectric effect associated with sequential magnetic and structural transitions upon cooling, we conducted combined x-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, dielectric constant, and magnetodielectric experiments. Powder neutron diffraction experiments revealed a series of magnetic Bragg peaks and clear splitting of peaks via structural transition. Magnetic Rietveld refinements, combined with group theory analysis, determined a noncollinear antiferromagnetic structure including a significant $c$-axis moment component at 1.5 K. This study provides insights into the understanding of its magnetoelectric properties.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16215v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Noise tailoring for error mitigation and for diagnozing digital quantum computers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04830</link><description>arXiv:2601.04830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Error mitigation (EM) methods are crucial for obtaining reliable results in the realm of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers, where noise significantly impacts output accuracy. Some EM protocols are particularly efficient for specific types of noise. Yet the noise in the actual hardware may not align with that. In this article, we introduce Noise Tailoring (NT) -- an innovative strategy designed to modify the structure of the noise associated with two-qubit gates through statistical sampling. We perform classical emulation of the protocol behavior and find that the NT+EM results can be up to 5 times more accurate than the results of EM alone for realistic Pauli noise acting on two-qubit gates. At the same time, on actual IBM quantum computers, the NT method falls victim to various small error sources beyond Markovian Pauli noise. We propose to use the NT method for characterizing such error sources on quantum computers in order to inform hardware development.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04830v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Cost scaling of MPS and TTNS simulations for 2D and 3D systems with area-law entanglement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08132</link><description>arXiv:2601.08132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor network states are an indispensable tool for the simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. In recent years, tree tensor network states (TTNS) have been successfully used for two-dimensional systems and to benchmark quantum simulation approaches for condensed matter, nuclear, and particle physics. In comparison to the more traditional approach based on matrix product states (MPS), the graph distance of physical degrees of freedom can be drastically reduced in TTNS. Surprisingly, it turns out that, for large systems in $D&gt;1$ spatial dimensions, MPS simulations of low-energy states are nevertheless more efficient than TTNS simulations. With a focus on $D=2$ and 3, the scaling of computational costs for different boundary conditions is determined under the assumption that the system obeys an entanglement (log-)area law, implying that bond dimensions scale exponentially in the surface area of the associated subsystems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08132v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dissipative Quantum Dynamics in Static Network with Different Topologies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15439</link><description>arXiv:2601.15439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dissipative dynamics of quantum population and coherence among different network topologies of a quantum network using a quantum spin model coupled to a thermal bosonic reservoir. Our study proceeds in two parts. First, we analyze a small network of Ising spins embedded in a large dissipative bath, modeled via the Lindblad master equation, where temperature arises naturally from system-bath coupling. This approach reveals how network topology shapes quantum dissipative dynamics, providing a basis for controlling quantum coherence through tailored network structures. Second, we propose a mean-field approach that extends the network to larger scales and captures dissipative dynamics in large-scale networks, connecting network topology to quantum coherence in complex systems and revealing the sensitivity of quantum coherence to network structure. Our results highlight how dissipative quantum dynamics depend on network topology, providing insight into the coherent dynamics of entangled states in networks. These results may be extended to dynamics in complex systems such as opinion propagation in social models, epidemiology, and various condensed-phase and biological systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15439v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Visualization of Gaussian Mode Profile in Gigahertz Surface-Acoustic-Wave Resonators</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15480</link><description>arXiv:2601.15480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface-acoustic-wave (SAW) resonators operating at gigahertz (GHz) frequencies are widely used in wireless telecommunication and quantum information processing. Successful implementation of such resonators calls for detailed microscopic understanding of their mode profiles, energy dissipation channels, and imperfections from microfabrication. In this work, we report on the visualization of acoustic waves in LiNbO3 SAW resonators by transmission-mode microwave impedance microscopy (TMIM). The Gaussian mode profile tightly confined by reflecting mirrors is vividly seen in the TMIM images, from which the linewidth of the resonator itself can be extracted. The spatially resolved acoustic profile also allows us to perform failure analysis on faulty devices. Our work establishes a pathway for further optimization of SAW resonators for classical and quantum acoustic applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15480v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Bidirectional teleportation using scrambling dynamics: a practical protocol</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15536</link><description>arXiv:2601.15536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that quantum information scrambling can enable a generic SWAP gate between collective degrees of freedom in systems without universal local control.

Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of antiferromagnetic dimers within a Rydberg atom chain in the regime where laser detuning compensates for nearest-neighbor (NN) interactions. Using an effective PXQ model, we demonstrate that the associated Hilbert space decomposes into disconnected, dimer-conserving subspaces. The classification of these subspaces is provided, and the computational basis states spanning them are identified. Through a combination of analytical mapping and numerical simulations, we compare the dynamics of the PXQ model with those of the full Rydberg atom chain. The deviations are attributed to two factors, laser-induced leakage from the constrained Hilbert subspace and the influence of long-range interactions beyond the NN limit. Our results indicate that subspace leakage can be mitigated by increasing the NN interaction strength. While this simultaneously amplifies the effects of long-range interactions, the conservation of the dimer number remains. Our study opens up possibilities for exploring the dynamics of antiferromagnetic dimers using the Rydberg atom quantum simulator.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15866v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Frictional work and entropy production in integrable and non-integrable spin chains</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15941</link><description>arXiv:2601.15941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The maximum work extractable from a quantum system is achieved when the system is driven adiabatically. Frictional work then quantifies the difference in work output between adiabatic and non-adiabatic driving. Here we show that frictional work in a non-integrable spin chain is well-described by the diagonal entropy production associated with the build up of quantum coherence. The relationship is characterized by an effective temperature of the final adiabatic state and holds for slow to moderate driving protocols. For fast protocols, the frictional work is instead described by the quantum relative entropy between the final non-adiabatic and adiabatic states. We compare our results to those obtained from an integrable spin chain, in which case the adiabatic state is no longer described by a single temperature. In this case, the frictional work is described by a sum of terms for each independent subspace of the spin chain, which are at different effective temperatures. We show how integrability breaking can enhance work extraction in the adiabatic limit, but degrade work extraction in sufficiently non-adiabatic regimes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15941v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Engineering polarization: How contradictory stimulation systematically undermines political moderation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16181</link><description>arXiv:2601.16181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Political moderation, a key attractor in democratic systems, proves highly fragile under realistic information conditions. We develop a stochastic model of opinion dynamics to analyze how noise and differential susceptibility reshape the political spectrum. Extending Marvel et al.'s deterministic framework, we incorporate stochastic media influence $\zeta(t)$ and neuropolitically-grounded sensitivity differences ($\sigma_y &gt; \sigma_x$). Analysis reveals the moderate population -- stable in deterministic models -- undergoes catastrophic collapse under stochastic forcing. This occurs through an effective deradicalization asymmetry ($u_{B}^{\text{eff}} = u + \sigma_y^2/2 &gt; u_{A}^{\text{eff}}$) that drives conservatives to extinction, eliminating cross-cutting interactions that sustain moderates. The system exhibits a phase transition from multi-stable coexistence to liberal dominance, demonstrating how information flow architecture -- independent of content -- systematically dismantles the political center. Our findings reveal moderation as an emergent property highly vulnerable to stochastic perturbations in complex social systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16181v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Floquet Non-Bloch Formalism for a Non-Hermitian Ladder: From Theoretical Framework to Topolectrical Circuits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23744</link><description>arXiv:2507.23744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodically driven systems intertwined with non-Hermiticity opens a rich arena for topological phases that transcend conventional Hermitian limits. The physical significance of these phases hinges on obtaining the topological invariants that restore the bulk-boundary correspondence, a task well explored for static non-Hermitian (NH) systems, while it remains elusive for the driven scenario. Here, we address this problem by constructing a generalized Floquet non-Bloch framework that analytically captures the spectral and topological properties of time-periodic NH systems. Employing a high-frequency Magnus expansion, we analytically derive an effective Floquet Hamiltonian and formulate the generalized Brillouin zone for a periodically driven quasi-one-dimensional system, namely, the Creutz ladder with a staggered complex potential. Our study demonstrates that the skin effect remains robust (despite the absence of non-reciprocal hopping) across a broad range of driving parameters, and is notably amplified in the low-frequency regime due to emergent longer-range couplings. We further employ a symmetric time frame approach that generates chiral-partner Hamiltonians, whose invariants, when appropriately combined, account for the full edge-state structure. To substantiate the theoretical framework, we propose a topolectrical circuit (TEC) that serves as a viable experimental setting. Apart from capturing the skin modes, the proposed TEC design faithfully reproduces the presence of distinct Floquet edge states, as revealed through the voltage and impedance profiles, respectively. Thus, our work not only offers a theoretical framework for exploring NH-driven systems, but also provides an experimentally feasible TEC architecture for realizing these phenomena stated above in a laboratory.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.23744v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Simulation of a generalized asset exchange model with investment and income mechanisms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05810</link><description>arXiv:2508.05810v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Non-collinear antiferromagnets (NCAFMs) are appealing for antiferromagnetic spintronics, as they combine the advantages of collinear antiferromagnets with novel emergent phenomena stemming from their complex spin structures. These phenomena are often associated with the intrinsic spin chirality, which characterizes the handedness of the ground-state spin configuration. Non-collinear antiferromagnets (NCAFMs) are appealing for antiferromagnetic spintronics, as they combine the advantages of collinear antiferromagnets with novel emergent phenomena stemming from their complex spin structures. These phenomena are often associated with the intrinsic spin chirality, which characterizes the handedness of the ground-state spin configuration. Here, we investigate a kagome NCAFM interfaced with a normal metal and demonstrate that the ground-state vector spin chirality can be probed through measurements of the spin Seebeck effect (SSE). Starting from a microscopic spin Hamiltonian, we derive the corresponding bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonians for the two chiral configurations. Using linear response theory, we obtain a general expression for the spin current thermally pumped into the normal metal by the SSE. We show that a sizable in-plane spin current emerges exclusively in the negative-chiral state, providing a direct signature for real-time detection of chirality switching in kagome NCAFMs. In addition, we find a field-dependent out-of-plane spin current whose magnitude differs between the two chiralities by about 81%, reflecting their distinct magnon band structures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.17798v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dynamical mean field approach to associative memory model with non-monotonic transfer functions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19146</link><description>arXiv:2510.19146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hopfield associative memory model stores random patterns in synaptic couplings according to Hebb's rule and retrieves them through gradient descent on an energy function. This conventional setting, where neurons are assumed to have monotonic transfer functions, has been central to understanding associative memory. Morita (1993, Neural Netw. 6 115), however, showed that introducing non-monotonic transfer functions can dramatically enhance retrieval performance. While this phenomenon has been qualitatively examined, a full quantitative theory remains elusive due to the difficulty of analysis in the absence of an underlying energy function. In this work, we apply dynamical mean-field theory to the discrete-time synchronous retrieval dynamics of the non-monotonic model, which succeeds in accurately characterizing its macroscopic dynamical properties. We also derive conditions for retrieval states, and clarify their relation to previous studies. Our results provide new insights into the non-equilibrium retrieval dynamics of associative memory models.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.19146v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Thickness dependent rare earth segregation in magnetron deposited NdCo$_{4.6}$ thin films studied by Xray reflectivity and Hard Xray photoemission</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23852</link><description>arXiv:2510.23852v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic anisotropy in disordered rare-earth-transition metals (RE-TM) compounds arises from RE atoms occupying asymmetric environments within the TM lattice. However, the underlying mechanism that promotes such environments remains not fully understood. In this study, we investigate amorphous NdCo$_{4.6}$ thin films deposited by magnetron sputtering, where the magnetic anisotropy evolves with thickness from in-plane to out-of-plane orientation above 40 nm. X-ray reflectivity measurements revealed the progressive formation of an additional layer between the 3 nm Si capping layer and the NdCo film with increasing film thickness. To probe the composition and distribution of Co and Nd near the surface, Hard X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy (HAXPES) was performed on films ranging from 5 nm to 65 nm in thickness using incident photon energies of 7, 10, and 13 keV. These correspond to inelastic electron mean free paths of 7.2-12.3 nm in cobalt. The cobalt atomic concentration, deduced from HAXPES at the Nd 3d and Co 2p excitations, was consistently below the nominal value and varied with both thickness and photon energy. This indicates segregation of RE atoms at the film surface, which becomes more pronounced with increasing thickness. Background analysis of the Co 2p and Nd 3d peaks supports this conclusion. The thickness of the Nd segregated layer is estimated in 2-3 nm. These findings demonstrate that incorporating neodymium into the cobalt lattice incurs an energy cost which is associated with strain due to the volume mismatch between the two elements. Reducing this strain energy promotes anisotropic atomic environments for Nd, thereby explaining the emergence of perpendicular anisotropy and its dependence on film thickness in these RE-TM compounds.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.23852v5</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The Zubarev Double Time Greens function-A Vintage Many Body Technique</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03439</link><description>arXiv:2601.03439v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Cooperative effects in oscillator networks are often associated with enhanced stability of phase-locked solutions, which increases with system size. We show that the stabilization of persistent currents in annular atomic superfluids with periodic barriers is a concrete manifestation of this phenomenon. Under the simplifying assumption of continuity of atomic flow across identical barriers, the system reduces to a ring of locally coupled Kuramoto-like oscillators. We analytically derive the stability diagram of phase-locked configurations and quantify their robustness to noise and small random initial imperfections, finding excellent agreement with experimental observations. These results are inherent to the ring topology and independent of the specific physical platform.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15121v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Entropy-based analysis of single-qubit Otto and Carnot heat engines</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01567</link><description>arXiv:2505.01567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From an entropy-based formulation of the first law of thermodynamics in the quantum regime, we investigate the performance of Otto-like and Carnot-like engines for a single-qubit working medium. Within this framework, the first law includes an additional contribution -- coherence work -- that quantifies the energetic cost of deviating the quantum trajectory from its natural unitary evolution. We focus on the efficiency of the heat-to-coherence work conversion and show that the Carnot cycle achieves the classical Carnot efficiency, while the performance of the Otto cycle is upper-bounded by the Carnot efficiency corresponding to the extreme temperatures of the cycle. We identify entropy generation during the isochoric stages as the key source of irreversibility limiting the Otto cycle's efficiency.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.01567v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Madelung hydrodynamics of spin-orbit coupling: action principles, currents, and correlations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10698</link><description>arXiv:2601.10698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exploit the variational and Hamiltonian structures of quantum hydrodynamics with spin to unfold the correlation and torque mechanisms accompanying spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in electronic motion. Using Hamilton's action principle for the Pauli equation, we isolate SOC-induced quantum forces that act on the orbital Madelung--Bohm trajectories and complement the usual force terms known to appear in quantum hydrodynamics with spin. While the latter spin-hydrodynamic forces relate to the quantum geometric tensor (QGT), SOC-induced orbital forces originate from a particular current operator that contributes prominently to the spin current. This distinction between force terms reveals two fundamentally different mechanisms generating quantum spin-orbit correlations. Leveraging the Hamiltonian structure of the hydrodynamic system, we also elucidate spin transport features such as the correlation-induced quantum torques and the current shift in the spin Hall effect. This Hall shift leads to a new definition of the transport spin current thereby addressing an open question in spintronics. Finally, we illustrate the framework via the Madelung--Rashba equations for planar SOC configurations and propose a particle-based scheme for numerical implementation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10698v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] FlexLLM: Composable HLS Library for Flexible Hybrid LLM Accelerator Design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15710</link><description>arXiv:2601.15710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present FlexLLM, a composable High-Level Synthesis (HLS) library for rapid development of domain-specific LLM accelerators. FlexLLM exposes key architectural degrees of freedom for stage-customized inference, enabling hybrid designs that tailor temporal reuse and spatial dataflow differently for prefill and decode, and provides a comprehensive quantization suite to support accurate low-bit deployment. Using FlexLLM, we build a complete inference system for the Llama-3.2 1B model in under two months with only 1K lines of code. The system includes: (1) a stage-customized accelerator with hardware-efficient quantization (12.68 WikiText-2 PPL) surpassing SpinQuant baseline, and (2) a Hierarchical Memory Transformer (HMT) plug-in for efficient long-context processing. On the AMD U280 FPGA at 16nm, the accelerator achieves 1.29$\times$ end-to-end speedup, 1.64$\times$ higher decode throughput, and 3.14$\times$ better energy efficiency than an NVIDIA A100 GPU (7nm) running BF16 inference; projected results on the V80 FPGA at 7nm reach 4.71$\times$, 6.55$\times$, and 4.13$\times$, respectively. In long-context scenarios, integrating the HMT plug-in reduces prefill latency by 23.23$\times$ and extends the context window by 64$\times$, delivering 1.10$\times$/4.86$\times$ lower end-to-end latency and 5.21$\times$/6.27$\times$ higher energy efficiency on the U280/V80 compared to the A100 baseline. FlexLLM thus bridges algorithmic innovation in LLM inference and high-performance accelerators with minimal manual effort.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15710v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] DUET: Agentic Design Understanding via Experimentation and Testing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06247</link><description>arXiv:2512.06247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are being used to solve increasingly complex software engineering challenges, but struggle with hardware design tasks. Register Transfer Level (RTL) code presents a unique challenge for LLMs, as it encodes complex, dynamic, time-evolving behaviors using the low-level language features of SystemVerilog. LLMs struggle to infer these complex behaviors from the syntax of RTL alone, which limits their ability to complete all downstream tasks like code completion, documentation, or verification. In response to this issue, we present DUET: a general methodology for developing Design Understanding via Experimentation and Testing. DUET mimics how hardware design experts develop an understanding of complex designs: not just via a one-off readthrough of the RTL, but via iterative experimentation using a number of tools. DUET iteratively generates hypotheses, tests them with EDA tools (e.g., simulation, waveform inspection, and formal verification), and integrates the results to build a bottom-up understanding of the design. In our evaluations, we show that DUET improves AI agent performance on formal verification, when compared to a baseline flow without experimentation.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.06247v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Report for NSF Workshop on AI for Electronic Design Automation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14541</link><description>arXiv:2601.14541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report distills the discussions and recommendations from the NSF Workshop on AI for Electronic Design Automation (EDA), held on December 10, 2024 in Vancouver alongside NeurIPS 2024. Bringing together experts across machine learning and EDA, the workshop examined how AI-spanning large language models (LLMs), graph neural networks (GNNs), reinforcement learning (RL), neurosymbolic methods, etc.-can facilitate EDA and shorten design turnaround. The workshop includes four themes: (1) AI for physical synthesis and design for manufacturing (DFM), discussing challenges in physical manufacturing process and potential AI applications; (2) AI for high-level and logic-level synthesis (HLS/LLS), covering pragma insertion, program transformation, RTL code generation, etc.; (3) AI toolbox for optimization and design, discussing frontier AI developments that could potentially be applied to EDA tasks; and (4) AI for test and verification, including LLM-assisted verification tools, ML-augmented SAT solving, security/reliability challenges, etc. The report recommends NSF to foster AI/EDA collaboration, invest in foundational AI for EDA, develop robust data infrastructures, promote scalable compute infrastructure, and invest in workforce development to democratize hardware design and enable next-generation hardware systems.

These systems can be modeled as stochastic reaction-diffusion systems. In this pedagogical review, the authors apply powerful field-theoretic methods to these systems, unifying diverse approaches under a single framework. The methods are useful for handling chemical systems but also have applications in a wide range of areas such as ecology and epidemiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height="" src="https://cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/RMP/key_images/10.1103/9qlw-gyd7.png" width="200" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Rev.

Abstract: Transition--metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) uniquely combine topological electronic states realized without external magnetic fields with a strong optical response arising from long--lived excitons. Motivated by this confluence, we investigate an interacting fermion--boson system formed by coupling an exciton to a quasihole of a fractional Chern insulator (FCI) at filling fraction $1/3$. We introduce a kagome--lattice fermion--boson model hosting an electronic FCI and a mobile exciton whose dispersion is tunable from a parabolic band to a flatband. Using exact diagonalization, we demonstrate the emergence of exciton--quasihole bound states controlled by the repulsive electron--exciton interaction $V_{\mathrm{FB}}$ and the exciton kinetic energy $t_{\mathrm{B}}$. These states appear as low--lying levels in the fermion--boson spectrum, well separated from the scattering continuum, and arise despite repulsive interactions due to a residual attraction to the local charge depletion associated with a quasihole. Reducing $t_{\mathrm{B}}$ enhances this effect by favoring interaction--dominated binding. Our results provide a model description of moir\'e TMD heterostructures, including fractional Chern insulating twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ proximitized by excitonic TMD heterobilayers, where we estimate exciton--quasihole binding energy scales of $0.6$--$1.1$~meV, placing these effects within reach of photoluminescence spectroscopy.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14365v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Field-induced states and thermodynamics of the frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14380</link><description>arXiv:2601.14380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state and finite-temperature properties of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice in the presence of an external magnetic field. We focus on the highly frustrated regime around $J_2 \approx J_1/2$. The $h$-$T$ phase diagram is investigated with particular emphasis on the finite-temperature transition into the "up-up-up-down" state that is stabilized by thermal and quantum fluctuations and manifests itself as a plateau at one half of the saturation magnetization in the quantum case. We also discuss the enhanced magnetocaloric effect associated to the ground-state degeneracy that arises at the saturation field for $J_2=J_1/2$. For reference, we first study the classical case by classical Monte Carlo simulations. Then we turn to the extreme quantum limit of spin-1/2 where we perform zero- and finite-temperature Lanczos calculations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14380v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Vortex-parity-controlled diode effect in Corbino topological Josephson junctions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14384</link><description>arXiv:2601.14384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal supercurrents in Josephson junctions have recently emerged as a sensitive tool for investigating broken symmetries in superconducting quantum materials. Here, we report an even-odd Josephson diode effect (JDE) in Corbino-geometry junctions fabricated on the pristine surface of a bulk-insulating three-dimensional topological insulator (3DTI). We find that the diode polarity, which indicates the preferred direction of supercurrent flow, robustly alternates its sign depending on the parity (even or odd) of the enclosed vortex number. This behavior is absent in two key control devices: a non-topological graphene Corbino Josephson junction and a 3DTI-based linear Josephson junction. These results indicate that the polarity-tunable JDE is intrinsically linked to the unique combination of the proximitized topological superconductivity in the 3DTI surface and the Corbino device's closed-loop geometry. Our theoretical modeling attributes the observed sign change in diode polarity to the alternating sign of periodic boundary conditions in topological superconductors, supporting the interpretation that the vortex-parity-controlled JDE is a direct manifestation of the underlying Andreev bound state topology associated with the presence of non-Abelian anyons in the vortices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14384v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Coupled concentration-charge dynamics in asymmetric 1:1 electrolytes, local transient response and fluctuations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14442</link><description>arXiv:2601.14442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the coupled dynamics of concentration and charge in asymmetric 1:1 electrolytes, focusing on the interplay between diffusion asymmetry and external electric fields. Using Brownian dynamics simulations and linearized stochastic density functional theory (SDFT), we analyze the transient response of charge and number currents to inhomogeneous electric fields, as well as the steady-state spatio-temporal fluctuations under uniform fields. Our results reveal that asymmetry in ionic diffusion coefficients introduces a non-trivial coupling between charge and number transport, which modifies the two relaxation modes already present in symmetric electrolytes -- a fast one associated with charge relaxation and a slow one linked to ambipolar diffusion. The dynamics are further modulated by the applied field, which enhances diffusion, alters screening lengths, and induces oscillatory behavior in the relaxation modes. The SDFT framework provides closed-form expressions for the intermediate scattering matrix, capturing the dynamics of density fluctuations and cross-correlations between number and charge. These predictions are validated by simulations, demonstrating excellent agreement across a wide range of wave vectors, both at equilibrium and under a finite electric field. Our findings highlight the critical role of diffusion asymmetry and external fields in tuning the transport properties of electrolytes, with implications for nanofluidic devices, energy harvesting, and iontronic circuits. This work bridges theoretical insights with practical applications, offering a robust framework for understanding and controlling electrolyte dynamics in asymmetric systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14442v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Fracture initiation in silicate glasses via a universal shear localization mechanism</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14493</link><description>arXiv:2601.14493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shear bands lie at the root of fracture initiation in bulk metallic glasses and amorphous polymers. For silicate glasses, in contrast, studies have largely emphasized permanent volumetric strain, commonly referred to as densification. Here we systematically investigate indentation-induced fracture in two distinct families of aluminoborosilicate glasses. The results demonstrate that plastic shear flow plays a decisive role in governing fracture initiation. In addition, molecular dynamics simulations reveal a pronounced composition dependence of softening associated with plastic shear flow, closely mirroring the experimentally observed propensity for strain localization. We conclude that silicate glasses conform to a universal pattern of rupture initiation governed by localization of shear-deformation, aligning with a broad range of amorphous materials, including bulk metallic glasses and glassy polymers.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14493v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Majorana Fermions in spin up and down electronic complexes in spin-orbit coupled array of semiconductor quantum dots in proximity to $s$-type superconductor and in magnetic field</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14527</link><description>arXiv:2601.14527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor-s-type superconductor nanowires host spinful fermions and cannot be reduced to a single spinless Kitaev chain hosting single Majorana zero mode. Instead, such systems can be converted into two coupled p-wave Kitaev-like chains associated with different spin sectors. Using the bond Fermion transformation and exact diagonalization, we analyze parity resolved spectra and local spectral functions, demonstrating that zero-energy modes strongly localized at the system boundaries emerge only in one effective chain. Inter-chain coupling lifts parity degeneracy and redistributes the low-energy spectral weight, providing a controlled framework to assess the stability of Majorana-like modes in the finite spinful nanowires.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14527v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Theory of Andreev and shot noise spectroscopy for topological superconductors probed by $s$-wave superconducting tips</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14537</link><description>arXiv:2601.14537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) with $s$-wave superconducting tips has been widely applied to probe exotic superconductors, but its potential for investigating topological superconductors remains unclear. In junctions between an $s$-wave superconductor and a topological superconductor, the dominant tunneling process is Andreev reflection, in which Cooper pairs from the $s$-wave superconductor tunnel as particle--hole excitations into the surface state of the topological superconductor. In this work, we theoretically investigate the fundamental properties of Andreev and shot noise spectroscopy on topological superconductors, focusing on the $dI/dV$ characteristics and current noise. We develop a real-time description of an effective tunneling action incorporating Andreev reflection processes in the Keldysh formalism and derive analytical expressions for the Andreev reflection current and the associated current noise. Furthermore, we perform numerical simulations for representative topological superconductors and provide a catalog of $dI/dV$ spectra and the Fano factor. Our results establish guidelines for probing topological superconductivity using STM with $s$-wave superconducting tips, and provide theoretical benchmarks for future STS experiments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14537v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Hydrogen Activation via Dihydride Formation on a Rh1/Fe3O4(001) Single-Atom Catalyst</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14756</link><description>arXiv:2601.14756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen activation is a key elementary step in catalytic hydrogenation. In heterogeneous catalysis, it usually proceeds through dissociative adsorption on metal nanoparticles followed by surface diffusion or spillover, whereas homogeneous catalysts activate H2 through dihydride or dihydrogen intermediates at a single metal center. Here, we show that isolated Rh adatoms supported on Fe3O4(001) activate hydrogen through formation of a stable dihydride species without atomic H spillover. Temperature-programmed desorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning tunneling microscopy collectively reveal strong (approximately 1 eV) hydrogen adsorption exclusively at isolated Rh1 sites, while isotope-exchange experiments further demonstrate that hydrogen remains localized. Density-functional theory based calculations indicate a barrierless conversion from molecular H2 to the dihydride, and random-phase approximation calculations further confirm the relative stability of the dihydride. Together, these results show that single-atom Rh sites cleave and bind H2 through a dihydride pathway analogous to homogeneous complexes, establishing a mechanistic bridge between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14756v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spin-orbit-driven quarter semimetals in rhombohedral graphene</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14930</link><description>arXiv:2601.14930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semimetals exhibit intriguing characteristics attributed to the coexistence of both electrons and holes. In rhombohedral multilayer graphene, a strong trigonal warping effect gives rise to a semi-metallic state near the Fermi surface, offering unique opportunities to explore the interplay of semi-metallic properties with strong correlations and topologies. Here, the observation of quarter semimetals in rhombohedral multilayer graphene by introducing spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is reported. The semi-metallic characteristics of rhombohedral graphene manifest as nearly vanished Hall resistance and parabolic longitudinal resistance. The strong correlations arising from the surface flat band lead to spontaneous symmetry breaking. SOC proximitized by WSe2 further lifts the valley degeneracy, resulting in the spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking, as evidenced by the hysteretic anomalous Hall effect. The coexistence of fully polarized electrons and holes allows for the observation of a non-monotonic temperature dependence of the anomalous Hall resistance. Furthermore, the application of moderate magnetic fields induces a phase transition from quarter semimetals to Chern insulators. These findings establish rhombohedral multilayer graphene as an ideal platform for studying strong correlations and topologies in semimetals.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14930v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Self-organized flows break morphological symmetry in active/passive systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15001</link><description>arXiv:2601.15001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a phase-separating mixture of active and passive fluids and explore morphological asymmetries of the emerging dominantly bicontinous dynamic emulsion. Two-dimensional numerical simulations reveal that the geometric and topological asymmetries can solely be explained by self-organized flows in the active region. As in inertial turbulence an inverse energy cascade in the active region leads to the formation of condensates. The size of these mesocales vortices is determined by the locally available space in the emulsion. As these condensates accumulate energy they impact the fluctuation of the surrounding interface and thus form a tight coupling between the flow field and the dynamic morphology. While explored for active/passive systems the symmetry-breaking mechanism can be generalized to heterogeneous active systems and proposes a way to control the morphology of various functional soft materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15001v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Anomalous Quantum Criticality at a Continuous Metal-Insulator Transition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15007</link><description>arXiv:2601.15007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Falicov-Kimball model (FKM) is long known to be the simplest model of correlated fermions exhibiting a novel Mott-like quantum critical point (QCP) assocaited with a {\it continuous} MIT in dimensions $D \geq 3$. It is also known to be isomorphic to an {\it annealed} binary-alloy disorder model. Notwithstanding extensive numerical studies for the FKM, analytic insight into the microscopic processes spawning novel Mott-like quantum criticality is scarce. Here, we develop a fully analytic theory for the Mott-like quantum criticality in the FKM on a hierarchical Cayley tree (Bethe lattice) by utilizing a single input from a 2-site cluster-dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT). We find that density fluctuation modes acquire anomalous dimensions, originating from infra-red power-law singular cluster self-energies. Interestingly, we uncover, at $T=0$, that this {\it sub-diffusive} metal with glassy dynamics separating a weakly ergodic metal from a non-ergodic insulator shrinks to a single point, namely the Mott-like QCP, at least on the Bethe lattice. We detail the consequences of this anomalous quantum criticality for a range of thermal and dynamical responses in a variety of physical systems that can be effectively modelled by the FKM.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15007v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quasisymmetry Enriched Gapless Criticality at Chern Insulator Transitions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15011</link><description>arXiv:2601.15011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In continuous topological phase transitions (CTPTs), the low-energy physics is governed by gap-closing subspaces, where approximate "higher" symmetries, termed quasisymmetries, may emerge. Here, we introduce the notion of quasisymmetry enrichment of these transitions. Focusing on paradigmatic normal-to-Chern insulator transitions, we identify quasisymmetries in the gapless subspaces, which subdivide CTPTs of the same universality class according to quasisymmetry charges. Gapless criticalities with nontrivial charges exhibit regulated phenomena, including intrinsic correlations between charge and pseudospin currents and continuous generalized Hall conductivities governed by the generalized St\v{r}eda formula, both conventionally exclusive to gapped phases. These features arise as quasisymmetry forbids certain matrix elements, rendering the generalized Berry curvature integrable. By establishing quasisymmetry as a fundamental classifying ingredient, our work adds a new dimension for understanding the rich landscape of quantum phase transitions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15011v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Cooperative stabilization of persistent currents in superfluid ring networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15121</link><description>arXiv:2601.15121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative effects in oscillator networks are often associated with enhanced stability of phase-locked solutions, which increases with system size. We show that the stabilization of persistent currents in annular atomic superfluids with periodic barriers is a concrete manifestation of this phenomenon. Under the simplifying assumption of continuity of atomic flow across identical barriers, the system reduces to a ring of locally coupled Kuramoto-like oscillators. We analytically derive the stability diagram of phase-locked configurations and quantify their robustness to noise and small random initial imperfections, finding excellent agreement with experimental observations. These results are inherent to the ring topology and independent of the specific physical platform.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15121v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Vacuum Torque Without Anisotropy: Switchable Casimir Torque Between Altermagnets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14381</link><description>arXiv:2601.14381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Casimir torque is conventionally associated with explicit breaking of rotational symmetry, arising from material dielectric anisotropy, geometric asymmetry, or externally applied fields that themselves break rotational invariance. Here we demonstrate a fundamentally different mechanism: an axially symmetric magnetic field can generate a Casimir torque by inducing an axially asymmetric Casimir energy - and can even reverse the torque's sign. Focusing on two-dimensional altermagnets, we show that a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the plane - while preserving in-plane rotational symmetry - activates an orientation-dependent vacuum interaction through the combined crystalline symmetry $\mathrm{C_n T}$ inherent to altermagnetic order. The resulting torque emerges continuously and scales quadratically with the magnetic field strength. We further analyze its temperature and distance dependence, revealing scaling behaviors that are qualitatively different from those found in uniaxial bulk materials. Our results identify time-reversal symmetry breaking as a powerful route for engineering both the sign and strength of Casimir torque and establish altermagnets as an exciting platform for exploring phenomena driven by vacuum quantum fluctuations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14381v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Acoustic phonons in a magnetized vacuum?

Abstract: We use numerical Monte Carlo simulations to determine the mass spectrum of the bosonic sector of the electroweak model in an external magnetic field of the electroweak-scale strength ($10^{20}\,{\rm T}$) at zero temperature. It is known that as the magnetic field gets stronger, the electroweak vacuum undergoes two consecutive crossover-type transitions, passing from (i) the conventional symmetry-broken homogeneous phase to (ii) an intermediate inhomogeneous vortex phase characterized by a (superconducting) condensate of electrically charged $W$ bosons and then to (iii) a homogeneous phase with a restored electroweak symmetry. We show that the spin component of the $W$ boson aligned with the direction of the magnetic field is the lightest excitation in all three phases. Its mass continuously decreases in the low-field broken phase and becomes very small in the intermediate phase. We argue that this nearly massless excitation corresponds to a Goldstone acoustic phonon mode associated with vibrations of the lattice of electroweak vortices. In the high-field symmetry-restored phase, where the vortices disappear, the lightest $W$ mass rises again. Neither Higgs nor $Z$ boson masses vanish across all studied phases and crossover transitions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14573v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The missing links: Evaluating contact tracing with incomplete data in large metropolitan areas during an epidemic</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14632</link><description>arXiv:2601.14632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contact tracing (CT) plays a pivotal role in controlling early epidemic spread, particularly when a novel infectious disease emerges. However, the quantitative impact of missing information -- such as untraced cases or unnotified contacts -- on the effectiveness of CT remains insufficiently understood. Using a stochastic agent-based model with sociodemographics from metropolitan areas in South Korea, we simulate how different forms of information loss affect epidemic spreading dynamics. We construct information-loss scenarios based on two types: infector-omission (IO) and contact-omission (CO), including selective (SCO) and uniform (UCO) scenarios; IO corresponds to the omission of infected individuals (nodes) from the tracing process, leading to the loss of all movement trajectories and downstream transmission links originating from them, whereas CO corresponds to the omission of specific contact events (edges), in which infected individuals are identified but some of their transmission links fail to be detected or notified. The sensitivity of epidemic dynamics to increasing omission rates differs markedly between the two types: IO scenarios exhibit substantially stronger and more abrupt changes in transmission structure and epidemic outcomes, whereas CO scenarios produce more gradual effects. In both scenarios, the magnitude of these effects varies across cities, with a lower-population city (Busan) showing greater tolerance to information loss than the largest city (Seoul), underscoring the importance of regional tailoring in CT strategies. Both IO and CO scenarios also lead to an increase in the transmission network diameter as information loss grows, indicating that a small network diameter reflects effective contact tracing that limits the depth of transmission chains.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14632v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Resonant Excitation Induced Vibronic Mollow Triplets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14963</link><description>arXiv:2601.14963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mollow triplet is the definitive spectral signature of an optically dressed quantum emitter. We predict that for emitters coupled to localized phonons, this signature is not confined to the zero-phonon line. Under a strong resonant drive, we show that Mollow triplets are strikingly replicated on the associated phonon sidebands -a surprising result, given that phonon sidebands are typically viewed as incoherent, inelastic scattering pathways. These vibronic Mollow triplets are a direct fingerprint of dynamically generated dressed states that hybridize the emitter's electronic, photonic, and vibrational degrees of freedom. We develop a scalable analytical formalism to model this effect in complex, multi-mode molecular systems, such as dibenzoterrylene. Our work provides the precise driving conditions for observing these novel spectral features, establishing a new signature of coherence in vibronically coupled systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14963v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Turbulence and far-from-equilibrium equation of state of Bogoliubov waves in Bose-Einstein Condensates</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15163</link><description>arXiv:2408.15163v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bogoliubov waves are fundamental excitations of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs). They emerge from a perturbed ground state and interact nonlinearly, triggering turbulent cascades. Here, we study turbulent BECs theoretically and numerically using the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii model and its associated wave-kinetic equations. We derive a new Kolmogorov-like stationary spectrum for short Bogoliubov waves and find a complete analytical expression for the spectrum in the long-wave acoustic regime. We then use our predictions to explain the BEC equation of state reported in [Dora et al. Nature 620,521 (2023)], and to suggest new experimental settings.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2408.15163v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Homogenization framework for rigid and non-rigid foldable origami metamaterials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00037</link><description>arXiv:2509.00037v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Origami metamaterials typically consist of folded sheets with periodic patterns, conferring them with remarkable mechanical properties. In the context of Continuum Mechanics, the majority of existing predictive methods are mechanism analogs which favor rigid folding and panel bending. While effective in predicting primary deformation modes, existing methods fall short in capturing the full spectrum of deformation of non-rigid foldable origami, such as the emergence of curvature along straight creases, local strain at vertices and warpage in panels. To fully capture the entire deformation spectrum and enhance the accuracy of existing methods, this paper introduces a homogenization framework for origami metamaterials where the faces are modeled as plate elements. Both asymptotic and energy-based homogenization methods are formulated and implemented. As a representative crease pattern, we examine the Miura origami sheet homogenized as an equivalent Kirchhoff-Love plate. The results reveal that certain effective elastic properties are nonlinearly related to both the initial fold angle and the crease stiffness. When benchmarked with results from fully resolved simulations, our framework yields errors up to 12.9\%, while existing models, including the bar-and-hinge model and the rigid-panel model, show up to 161\% error. The differences in errors are associated with the complex modes of crease and panel deformation in non-rigid origami, unexplored by the existing models. This work demonstrates a precise and efficient continuum framework for origami metamaterials as an effective strategy for predicting their elastic properties, understanding their mechanics, and designing their functionalities.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.00037v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Hamiltonian Active Particles in Incompressible Fluid Membranes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03609</link><description>arXiv:2512.03609v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active proteins and membrane-bound motors exert force dipole flows along fluid interfaces and lipid bilayers. We develop a Hamiltonian framework for the interactions of pusher and puller dipoles embedded in an incompressible two-dimensional membrane supported by a shallow viscous subphase. Beginning from the Brinkman-regularized Stokes equations of the membrane-subphase system, we construct the near- and far-field dipolar velocity and associated stream functions. Although generic dipoles reorient under the local membrane vorticity, we show that the far-field dipolar flow is vorticity-free; force-free motors therefore retain fixed orientation and obey a position-based Hamiltonian dynamics in which the positions of N dipoles evolve via an effective Hamiltonian built from the dipolar stream function. In the near field, where the flow possesses finite vorticity, a Hamiltonian formulation is recovered in the quenched-orientation limit. We demonstrate this Hamiltonian structure by simulating ensembles of pusher and puller dipoles and compare the dynamics generated by the near-field and far-field Hamiltonians. For identical dipoles, the far-field Hamiltonian produces rapid clustering from random initial conditions, whereas the near-field Hamiltonian suppresses collapse and yields extended, non-aggregating configurations. Our work thus provides a concrete realization of position-based Hamiltonian descriptions for active particles in incompressible fluid membranes and establishes the important roles of membrane incompressibility and fluid vorticity that leads to the emergence of such Hamiltonian descriptions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.03609v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Unavoidable Canonical Nonlinearity Induced by Gaussian Measures Discretization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08381</link><description>arXiv:2601.08381v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When we consider canonical averages for classical discrete systems, typically referred to as substitutional alloys, the map phi from many-body interatomic interactions to thermodynamic equilibrium configurations generally exhibits complicated nonlinearity. This canonical nonlinearity is fundamentally rooted in deviations of the discrete configurational density of states (CDOS) from continuous Gaussian families, and has conventionally been characterized by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence on discrete statistical manifold. Thus, the previous works inevitablly missed intrinsic nonlinearities induced by discretization of Gaussian families, which remains invisible within conventional information-geometric descriptions. In the present work, we identify and quantify such unavoidable canonical nonlinearity by employing the 2-Wasserstein distance with a cost function aligned with the Fisher metric for Gaussian families. We derive an explicit expression for the Wasserstein distance in the limit of vanishing discretization scale d to 0: W2 = d*sqrt(Tr(Gamma)^(-1)/12), where Gamma denotes covariance matrix of the CDOS. We further show that this limiting Wasserstein distance admits a clear geometric interpretation on the statistical manifold, equivalent to a KL divergence associated with the expected parallel translations of continuous Gaussian. Our framework thus provides a transport-information-geometric characterization of discretization-induced nonlinearity in classical discrete systems. In addition, we confirm that this W2-KL equivalence admits a natural generalization beyond Gaussian families, provided that the transport cost is aligned with the Fisher metric of an underlying statistical submanifold and the discretization scale links to infinitesimal parameter variations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08381v5</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Creation of ultracold heteronuclear p-wave Feshbach molecules</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12858</link><description>arXiv:2601.12858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the creation of optically trapped ultracold heteronuclear p-wave Feshbach molecules in a mixture of 23Na and 87Rb atoms. With loss spectroscopy and binding energy measurements, we systematically characterize the interspecies p-wave Feshbach resonances near 284 G. Leveraging this understanding, we use magneto-association to form p-wave NaRb Feshbach molecules, producing both pure samples and mixtures of molecules in different angular momentum states. Additionally, we investigate the inelastic loss of these molecules, primarily influenced by atom-molecule and molecule-molecule collisions. Our results represent a significant step toward realizing tunable p-wave interactions in heteronuclear ultracold systems and provide a foundation for exploring non-zero angular momentum molecules.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12858v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] End-to-End Transformer Acceleration Through Processing-in-Memory Architectures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14260</link><description>arXiv:2601.14260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers have become central to natural language processing and large language models, but their deployment at scale faces three major challenges. First, the attention mechanism requires massive matrix multiplications and frequent movement of intermediate results between memory and compute units, leading to high latency and energy costs. Second, in long-context inference, the key-value cache (KV cache) can grow unpredictably and even surpass the model's weight size, creating severe memory and bandwidth bottlenecks. Third, the quadratic complexity of attention with respect to sequence length amplifies both data movement and compute overhead, making large-scale inference inefficient. To address these issues, this work introduces processing-in-memory solutions that restructure attention and feed-forward computation to minimize off-chip data transfers, dynamically compress and prune the KV cache to manage memory growth, and reinterpret attention as an associative memory operation to reduce complexity and hardware footprint. Moreover, we evaluate our processing-in-memory design against state-of-the-art accelerators and general-purpose GPUs, demonstrating significant improvements in energy efficiency and latency. Together, these approaches address computation overhead, memory scalability, and attention complexity, further enabling efficient, end-to-end acceleration of Transformer models.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14260v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Multi-Partner Project: COIN-3D -- Collaborative Innovation in 3D VLSI Reliability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14347</link><description>arXiv:2601.14347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As semiconductor manufacturing advances from the 3-nm process toward the sub-nanometer regime and transitions from FinFETs to gate-all-around field-effect transistors (GAAFETs), the resulting complexity and manufacturing challenges continue to increase. In this context, 3D chiplet-based approaches have emerged as key enablers to address these limitations while exploiting the expanded design space. Specifically, chiplets help address the lower yields typically associated with large monolithic designs. This paradigm enables the modular design of heterogeneous systems consisting of multiple chiplets (e.g., CPUs, GPUs, memory) fabricated using different technology nodes and processes. Consequently, it offers a capable and cost-effective strategy for designing heterogeneous systems. This paper introduces the Horizon Europe Twinning project COIN-3D (Collaborative Innovation in 3D VLSI Reliability), which aims to strengthen research excellence in 2.5D/3D VLSI systems reliability through collaboration between leading European institutions. More specifically, our primary scientific goal is the provision of novel open-source Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools for reliability assessment of 3D systems, integrating advanced algorithms for physical- and system-level reliability analysis.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14347v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Pipeline Automation Framework for Reusable High-throughput Network Applications on FPGA</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15151</link><description>arXiv:2601.15151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a context of ever-growing worldwide communication traffic, cloud service providers aim at deploying scalable infrastructures to address heterogeneous needs. Part of the network infrastructure, FPGAs are tailored to guarantee low-latency and high-throughput packet processing. However, slowness of the hardware design process impairs FPGA ability to be part of an agile infrastructure under constant evolution, from incident response to long-term transformation. Deploying and maintaining network functionalities across a wide variety of FPGAs raises the need to fine-tune hardware designs for several FPGA targets. To address this issue, we introduce PAF, an open-source architectural parameterization framework based on a pipeline-oriented design methodology. PAF (Pipeline Automation Framework) implementation is based on Chisel, a Scala-embedded Hardware Construction Language (HCL), that we leverage to interface with circuit elaboration. Applied to industrial network packet classification systems, PAF demonstrates efficient parameterization abilities, enabling to reuse and optimize the same pipelined design on several FPGAs. In addition, PAF focuses the pipeline description on the architectural intent, incidentally reducing the number of lines of code to express complex functionalities. Finally, PAF confirms that automation does not imply any loss of tight control on the architecture by achieving on par performance and resource usage with equivalent exhaustively described implementations.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15151v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Report for NSF Workshop on AI for Electronic Design Automation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14541</link><description>arXiv:2601.14541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report distills the discussions and recommendations from the NSF Workshop on AI for Electronic Design Automation (EDA), held on December 10, 2024 in Vancouver alongside NeurIPS 2024. Bringing together experts across machine learning and EDA, the workshop examined how AI-spanning large language models (LLMs), graph neural networks (GNNs), reinforcement learning (RL), neurosymbolic methods, etc.-can facilitate EDA and shorten design turnaround. The workshop includes four themes: (1) AI for physical synthesis and design for manufacturing (DFM), discussing challenges in physical manufacturing process and potential AI applications; (2) AI for high-level and logic-level synthesis (HLS/LLS), covering pragma insertion, program transformation, RTL code generation, etc.; (3) AI toolbox for optimization and design, discussing frontier AI developments that could potentially be applied to EDA tasks; and (4) AI for test and verification, including LLM-assisted verification tools, ML-augmented SAT solving, security/reliability challenges, etc. The report recommends NSF to foster AI/EDA collaboration, invest in foundational AI for EDA, develop robust data infrastructures, promote scalable compute infrastructure, and invest in workforce development to democratize hardware design and enable next-generation hardware systems.

Abstract: Bridging the gap between algorithm development and hardware realization remains a persistent challenge, particularly in latency- and resource-constrained domains such as wireless communication. While MATLAB provides a mature environment for algorithm prototyping, translating these models into efficient FPGA implementations via High-Level Synthesis (HLS) often requires expert tuning and lengthy iterations. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for automating this process. However, existing approaches suffer from hallucinations, forgetting, limited domain expertise, and often overlook key performance metrics. To address these limitations, we present A2H-MAS, a modular and hierarchical multi-agent system. At the system level, A2H-MAS assigns clearly defined responsibilities to specialized agents and uses standardized interfaces and execution-based validation to ensure correctness and reproducibility. At the algorithmic level, it employs dataflow-oriented modular decomposition and algorithm-hardware co-design, recognizing that the choice of algorithm often has a larger impact on hardware efficiency than pragma-level optimization. Experiments on representative wireless communication algorithms show that A2H-MAS consistently produces functionally correct, resource-efficient, and latency-optimized HLS designs, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness for complex hardware development workflows.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.10904v3</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] A common DNA deletion altering the 3’UTR of &lt;i&gt;mdr1&lt;/i&gt; is associated with reduced mefloquine susceptibility in &lt;i&gt;P. vivax&lt;/i&gt; parasites from Cambodian patients</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68456-7</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 22 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68456-7"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-68456-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Plasmodium vivax is responsible for most malaria cases outside Africa and drug resistance is a concern.

Current treatments focus on thrombolysis and neuroprotection, with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and edaravone (Eda) as key drugs. However, their therapeutic efficacy is constrained by poor targeting, leading to suboptimal drug delivery to the brain. Herein, we develop a biomimetic delivery system (PLEA, Platelet membrane-Liposome hybrid delivery system encapsulating Eda and rt-PA) by hybridizing platelet membranes with liposomes, leveraging natural thrombus-targeting ability of platelet membrane to enhance drug delivery efficiency.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00152-5?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] TLR7-Mediated Inflammation Drives PD-L1 Upregulation and T Cell Exhaustion During Influenza A Virus Infection</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00151-3?rss=yes</link><description>T cell dysfunction driven by dysregulated PD-1/PD-L immune checkpoint signalling is associated with severe influenza A virus (IAV) infection. While this pathway limits immunopathology, it can suppress antiviral immunity and promote T cell exhaustion. We investigated the role of toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), a viral RNA sensor, in regulating PD-1/PD-L-mediated T cell responses during IAV infection. Using wild-type and TLR7-deficient mice, we show that TLR7 activation enhances early antiviral T cell responses but subsequently increases PD-L1/PD-L2 expression, promoting T cell exhaustion at later stages of infection.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid

Abstract: This paper presents the first thermodynamic assessment of binary and pseudo-binary phase diagrams in the Ba--La--S and Ga--La--S systems by means of the CALPHAD method. Experimental phase diagram equilibrium data and thermodynamic properties available from the literature were critically reviewed and assessed using thermodynamic models for the Gibbs energies of individual phases. The associated solution model was used to describe the short-range ordering behavior of the liquid phases. To supplement the limited experimental data reported in the literature, ab initio molecular dynamics calculations were employed to derive mixing enthalpies of the liquid phases in the binary subsystems. The resulting phase diagrams and calculated thermodynamic properties show good agreement with available literature within the investigated compositional ranges of binary and pseudo-binary systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11899v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Laughlin pumping assisted by surface acoustic waves</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11921</link><description>arXiv:2601.11921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Hall effect is a fascinating electrical transport phenomenon signified by precise quantization of Hall conductivity $\sigma_\mathrm{xy}$ and vanishing longitudinal conductivity $\sigma_\mathrm{xx}$. Laughlin proposed an elegant explanation in which adiabatic insertion of a flux tube pumps charge through the system. This analysis unveils the fundamental role of gauge invariance and provides a compelling argument about the fractional charge of fractional quantum Hall states. While it has been used extensively as a theoretical tool, a quantitative experimental investigation is lacking despite multiple attempts. Here we report successful realizations of Laughlin pumping in several integer and fractional quantum Hall states. One essential technical innovation is using surface acoustic waves to periodically clear the charges accumulated during the pumping process. Magnetic fluxes are inserted at a constant rate so there is no need to perform complicated data fitting. Furthermore, our setting can reliably extract $\sigma_\mathrm{xx}$ that is several orders of magnitude lower than the limit of conventional techniques. Effective energy gaps can be deduced from the temperature dependence of $\sigma_\mathrm{xx}$, which are drastically different from those provided by conventional transport data. This work not only brings a famous gedanken experiment to reality but also serves as a portal for many future investigations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11921v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Topological transitions in the presence of quenched uncorrelated disorder</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12001</link><description>arXiv:2601.12001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address issues related to the presence of defects at topological transitions, in particular when defects are modeled in terms of further variables associated with a quenched disorder, corresponding to the limit in which the defect dynamics is very slow. As a paradigmatic model, we consider the three-dimensional lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge model in the presence of quenched uncorrelated disorder associated with the plaquettes of the lattice, whose topological transitions are characterized by the absence of a local order parameter. We study the critical behaviors in the presence of weak disorder. We show that they belong to a new topological universality class, different from that of the lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge models without disorder, in agreement with the Harris criterium for the relevance of uncorrelated quenched disorder when the pure system undergoes a continuous transition with positive specific-heat critical exponent.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12001v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Robustness of the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism against symmetry breaking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12022</link><description>arXiv:2601.12022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how strongly broken spatial symmetries affect the Kohn--Luttinger (KL) mechanism, in which superconductivity emerges purely from repulsive interactions. While the original KL argument assumes continuous rotational symmetry, real materials possess only discrete point-group symmetries, raising a central question: can sufficiently strong symmetry breaking suppress or eliminate KL superconductivity? Using controlled perturbation theory and explicit two-dimensional models with Ising and Rashba spin--orbit coupling (SOC), we find that KL superconductivity is broadly robust and exhibits qualitatively universal behavior across models: the transition temperature $T_c$ is nonmonotonic in the symmetry-breaking field, shows a pronounced maximum at scales of the order of the Fermi energy, and decays exponentially toward zero at asymptotically large fields. However, the physical mechanisms determining this suppression may differ between models. Overall, these results demonstrate that KL-type superconductivity can persist across a wide class of spin--orbit-coupled systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12022v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Space-resolved stress correlations and viscoelastic moduli for polydisperse systems: the faces of the stress noise</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12069</link><description>arXiv:2601.12069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several advances in the theory of space-resolved viscoelasticity of liquids and other amorphous systems are discussed in the present paper. In particular, considering long-time regimes of stress relaxation in liquids we obtain the generalized compressibility equation valid for systems with mass polydispersity, and derive a new relation allowing to calculate the wavevector-dependent equilibrium transverse modulus in terms of the generalized structure factors. Turning to the basic relations between the spatially-resolved relaxation moduli and the spatio-temporal correlation functions of the stress tensor, we provide their new derivation based on a conceptually simple argument that does not involve consideration of non-stationary processes. We also elucidate the relationship between the stress noise associated with the classical Newtonian dynamics and the reduced deviatoric stress coming from the Zwanzig-Mori projection operator formalism. The general relations between the stress noise and the tensor of relaxation moduli are discussed as well.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12069v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Ontology-aligned structuring and reuse of multimodal materials data and workflows towards automatic reproduction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12582</link><description>arXiv:2601.12582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reproducibility of computational results remains a challenge in materials science, as simulation workflows and parameters are often reported only in unstructured text and tables. While literature data are valuable for validation and reuse, the lack of machine-readable workflow descriptions prevents large-scale curation and systematic comparison. Existing text-mining approaches are insufficient to extract complete computational workflows with their associated parameters. An ontology-driven, large language model (LLM)-assisted framework is introduced for the automated extraction and structuring of computational workflows from the literature. The approach focuses on density functional theory-based stacking fault energy (SFE) calculations in hexagonal close-packed magnesium and its binary alloys, and uses a multi-stage filtering strategy together with prompt-engineered LLM extraction applied to method sections and tables. Extracted information is unified into a canonical schema and aligned with established materials ontologies (CMSO, ASMO, and PLDO), enabling the construction of a knowledge graph using atomRDF. The resulting knowledge graph enables systematic comparison of reported SFE values and supports the structured reuse of computational protocols. While full computational reproducibility is still constrained by missing or implicit metadata, the framework provides a foundation for organizing and contextualizing published results in a semantically interoperable form, thereby improving transparency and reusability of computational materials data.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12582v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Engineering of Orbital Hybridization: An Exotic Strategy to Manipulate Orbital Current</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12841</link><description>arXiv:2601.12841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current-induced spin-orbit torque (SOT) plays a crucial role in the next-generation spin-orbitronics. Enhancing its efficiency is both fundamentally and practically interesting and remains a challenge to date. Recently, orbital counterparts of spin effects that do not rely on the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) have been found as an alternative mechanism to realize it. This work highlights the engineering of copper oxidation states for manipulating the orbital current and its torque in the CuO$_x$-based heterostructures. The orbital hybridization and thus the orbital-Rashba-Edelstein effect at the CuO$_x$/Cu interfaces are significantly enhanced by increasing the copper oxidation state, yielding a torque efficiency that is almost ten times larger than the conventional heavy metals. The Cu$_4$O$_3$/Cu interface, rather than the widely accepted CuO/Cu interface, is revealed to account for the enhanced SOT performance in the CuO$_x$-based heterostructures. In addition, the torque efficiency can be alternatively switched between high and low thresholds through the redox reaction. The current results establish an exotic and robust strategy for engineering the orbital current and SOT for spin-orbitronics, which applies to other weak-SOC materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12841v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Counting unlabelled multigraphs with three nodes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13163</link><description>arXiv:2601.13163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlabeled multigraphs have diverse applications across scientific fields, from transportation and social networks to polymer physics. In particular, multigraphs are essential for studying the relationship between the spatial organization and biological function of chromatin, which is often folded into complex polymer networks whose structure is closely tied to patterns of gene expression. A fundamental yet challenging aspect in applying graph theory to these areas is the enumeration of multigraphs, especially under structural constraints For example, when coupled with the statistical mechanics of polymer networks, the ability to identify traversable and connected multigraphs provides powerful tools for predicting statistically favored motifs that may arise within chromatin networks. In this work, by counting the adjacency matrices, we derive polynomial expressions that enumerate all connected, undirected, and unlabeled multigraphs with three nodes and fixed degree, and provide a method to efficiently generate them.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13163v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Structure and Memory Control Self-Diffusion in Active Matter</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13274</link><description>arXiv:2601.13274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite extensive progress in characterizing the emergent behavior of active matter, the microscopic origins of self-diffusion in interacting active systems remain poorly understood. Here, we develop a framework that quantitatively links self-diffusion to collisional forces and their temporal correlations in active fluids. We show that transport is governed by two contributions: an equal-time suppression of motion arising from anisotropic collisional forces, and a memory correction associated with the temporal persistence of these forces. Together, these effects yield an exact expression for the self-diffusivity in terms of measurable force statistics and correlation times. We apply this framework to purely repulsive active Brownian particles and find that self-diffusion is always reduced, with collisional memory acting as a strictly dissipative correction. Our results establish a direct connection between microscopic force correlations and macroscopic transport, providing a general mechanical perspective for interpreting self-diffusion in active matter.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13274v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Macroscopic localization and collective memory in Poisson renewal resetting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13595</link><description>arXiv:2601.13595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic renewal processes are ubiquitous across physics, biology, and the social sciences. Here, we show that continuous-time renewal dynamics can naturally produce a mixed discrete-continuous structure, with a macroscopic fraction of particles occupying a discrete state. For ensembles of continuous-time random walkers subject to Poissonian renewal resets, we develop an age-structured framework showing this discrete component corresponds to localization at the reset configuration. We next show that collective interactions can retain memory although all reset events are memoryless. Remarkably, the transition to collective memory is discontinuous, and we identify a first-order dynamical phase transition between weak collective bias, where the dynamics are stationary, to strong collective bias where the dynamics are nonstationary and display aging up to finite-size effects. We explicitly discuss ecological implications of our work, illustrating how continuous-time renewal dynamics shape macroscopic structure and collective organization with long-term memory.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13595v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Correlation-driven branch in doped excitonic insulators</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13890</link><description>arXiv:2601.13890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of a doped one-dimensional excitonic insulator. Employing matrix-product-state-based methods, we compute the single-particle spectrum and optical conductivity in a correlated two-band model. Our numerical calculation reveals the emergence of a correlation-driven in-gap branch in the doped state. The origin of the in-gap branch is examined by decomposing the propagation dynamics of a single particle, elucidating that the doping-induced branch is associated with excitonic correlations. Our demonstrations suggest that the doping-induced branch can serve as an indicator of electron-hole correlations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13890v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Component systems: do null models explain everything?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13985</link><description>arXiv:2601.13985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Component systems - ensembles of realizations built from a shared repertoire of modular parts - are ubiquitous in biological, ecological, technological, and socio-cultural domains. From genomes to texts, cities, and software, these systems exhibit statistical regularities that often meet the "bona fide" requirements of laws in the physical sciences. Here, we argue that the generality and simplicity of those laws are often due to basic combinatorial or sampling constraints, raising the question of whether such patterns are actually revealing system-specific mechanisms and how we might move beyond them. To this end, we first present a unifying mathematical framework, which allows us to compare modular systems in different fields and highlights the common "null" trends as well as the system-specific uniqueness, which, arguably, are signatures of the underlying generative dynamics. Next, we can exploit the framework with statistical mechanics and modern machine-learning tools for a twofold objective. (i) Explaining why the general regularities emerge, highlighting the constraints between them and the general principles at their origins, and (ii) "subtracting" them from data, which will isolate the informative features for inferring hidden system-specific generative processes, mechanistic and causal aspects.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13985v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Layer-engineered quantum anomalous Hall effect in twisted rhombohedral graphene family</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14014</link><description>arXiv:2601.14014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator is uniquely characterized by the topological Chern number C. Controlling the Chern number is a key step toward functional topological electronics and enables access to exotic quantum phases beyond the traditional quantum Hall physics. Here, we report a series of QAH insulators in twisted rhombohedral graphene family, in which the Chern number can be tuned through layer configuration, in-situ electrostatic doping, and displacement field. Specifically, in twisted monolayer-rhombohedral N-layer graphene, denoted as (1+N) L, we observe QAH states with C=N at moire filling v=1, where N=3,4,5 represents the layer number of rhombohedral graphene. These results are experimentally confirmed by quantized Hall resistance and the Streda formula. In twisted monolayer-trilayer graphene, we also observe states with |C|=3 at v=3, whose sign can be switched by either electrostatic doping or displacement field. Furthermore, in twisted Bernal bilayer-rhombohedral tetralayer graphene denoted as (2+4) L, we demonstrate a displacement-field-driven topological phase transition between two distinct QAH states with C=3 and C=4 at v=1. Our work establishes twisted rhombohedral graphene as a highly versatile, layer-engineered platform for designing and dynamically controlling high-Chern-number topological matters.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14014v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Faster grain-boundary diffusion with a higher activation enthalpy than bulk diffusion in ionic space-charge layers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14181</link><description>arXiv:2601.14181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Faster diffusion of cations along grain boundaries is reported in the literature for a variety of acceptor-doped $AB\mathrm{O}_{3}$ perovskite-type oxides. The ratio $r$ of the activation enthalpy of grain-boundary diffusion ($\Delta H^\mathrm{gb}$) to the activation enthalpy of bulk diffusion ($\Delta H^\mathrm{b}$) is seen experimentally to lie in the range $0.7 &lt; r = \Delta H^\mathrm{gb} / \Delta H^\mathrm{b} &lt; 1.3$, albeit with substantial errors. In a previous publication [Parras and De Souza, Acta Mater. 195 (2020) 383] it was shown through a set of continuum simulations that cation-vacancy accumulation within negative space-charge layers at grain boundaries in acceptor-doped perovskites will give rise to faster grain-boundary diffusion of cations, with the associated values of $r$ approaching but not exceeding unity. In the present study, we demonstrate by means of continuum simulations that under certain conditions $r &gt; 1$ is achievable for faster cation diffusion along grain boundaries in an acceptor-doped perovskite ceramic. Diffusion profiles for a two-dimensional bicrystal geometry are obtained by solving, first, Poisson's equation, and subsequently, the diffusion equation. The specific case we consider is cation migration occurring by two related mechanisms, by isolated cation vacancies and by defect associates of cation and anion vacancies; the electric potential within the space-charge layers shifts the association equilibrium so that associate diffusion dominates in the bulk whereas isolated vacancy diffusion dominates within the space-charge layers. The conditions under which $r &gt; 1$ is observed are described, and issues with experimental confirmation are discussed.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14181v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Energy flow controls the stability of multitrophic ecosystems with stratified nonreciprocity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12717</link><description>arXiv:2601.12717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex systems with nonreciprocal interactions are often stratified into layers. Ecosystems are a prime example, where species at one trophic level grow by consuming those at another. Yet the dynamical consequences of such stratified nonreciprocity -- where the correlation between growth and consumption differs across trophic levels -- remain unexplored. Here, using an ecological model with three trophic levels, we reveal an emergent asymmetry: nonreciprocal interactions between consumers and predators (top and middle level) destabilize ecosystems far more readily than nonreciprocity between consumers and resources (middle and bottom level). We analytically derive the phase diagram for the model and show that its stability boundary is controlled by energy flow across trophic levels. Because energy flows upward -- from resources to predators -- diversity is progressively lower at higher trophic levels, which we show explains the asymmetry. Lowering energy flow efficiency flips the asymmetry toward resources and remarkably expands the stable region of the phase diagram, suggesting that the famous "10% energy transfer" seen in natural ecosystems might promote stability. More broadly, our findings show that the location of nonreciprocity within a complex network, not merely its magnitude, determines stability.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12717v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Creation of ultracold heteronuclear p-wave Feshbach molecules</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12858</link><description>arXiv:2601.12858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the creation of optically trapped ultracold heteronuclear p-wave Feshbach molecules in a mixture of 23Na and 87Rb atoms. With loss spectroscopy and binding energy measurements, we systematically characterize the interspecies p-wave Feshbach resonances near 284 G. Leveraging this understanding, we use magneto-association to form p-wave NaRb Feshbach molecules, producing both pure samples and mixtures of molecules in different angular momentum states. Additionally, we investigate the inelastic loss of these molecules, primarily influenced by atom-molecule and molecule-molecule collisions. Our results represent a significant step toward realizing tunable p-wave interactions in heteronuclear ultracold systems and provide a foundation for exploring non-zero angular momentum molecules.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12858v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Efficient local classification of parity-based material topology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13598</link><description>arXiv:2601.13598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the classification of crystalline materials can be generally handled by momentum-space-based approaches, topological classification of aperiodic materials remains an outstanding challenge, as the absence of translational symmetry renders such conventional approaches inapplicable. Here, we present a numerically efficient real-space framework for classifying parity-based $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology in aperiodic systems based on the spectral localizer framework and the direct computation of the sign of a Pfaffian associated with a large sparse skew-symmetric matrix. Unlike projector-based or momentum-space-based approaches, our method does not rely on translational symmetry, spectral gaps in the Hamiltonian's bulk, or gapped auxiliary operators such as spin projections, and instead provides a local, energy-resolved topological invariant accompanied by an intrinsic measure of topological protection. A central contribution of this work is the development of a scalable sparse factorization algorithm that enables the reliable determination of the Pfaffian's sign for large sparse matrices, making the approach practical to realistic physical materials. We apply this framework to identify the quantum spin Hall effect in quasicrystalline class AII systems, including gapless heterostructures, and to diagnose fragile topology in a large $C_2 \mathcal{T}$-symmetric photonic quasicrystal. Overall, our results demonstrate that the spectral localizer, combined with efficient sparse numerical methods, provides a unified and robust tool for diagnosing parity-based topological phases in aperiodic electronic, photonic, and acoustic materials where conventional band-theoretic indexes are inapplicable.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13598v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interpretable, Physics-Informed Learning Reveals Sulfur Adsorption and Poisoning Mechanisms in 13-Atom Icosahedra Nanoclusters</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13845</link><description>arXiv:2601.13845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition-metal nanoclusters exhibit structural and electronic properties that depend on their size, often making them superior to bulk materials for heterogeneous catalysis. However, their performance can be limited by sulfur poisoning. Here, we use dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT) and physics-informed machine learning to map how atomic sulfur adsorbs and causes poisoning on 13-atom icosahedral clusters from 30 different transition metals (3$d$ to 5$d$). We measure which sites sulfur prefers to adsorb to, the thermodynamics and energy breakdown, changes in structure, such as bond lengths and coordination, and electronic properties, such as $\varepsilon_d$, the HOMO-LUMO gap, and charge transfer. Vibrational analysis reveals true energy minima and provides ZPE-based descriptors that reflect the lattice stiffening upon sulfur adsorption. For most metals, the metal-sulfur interaction mainly determines adsorption energy. At the same time, distortion penalties are usually moderate but can be significant for a few metals, suggesting these are more likely to restructure when sulfur is adsorbed. Using unsupervised \textit{k}-means clustering, we identify periodic trends and group metals based on their adsorption responses. Supervised regression models with leave-one-feature-out analysis identify the descriptors that best predict adsorption for new samples. Our results highlight the isoelectronic triad \ce{Ti}, \ce{Zr}, and \ce{Hf} as a balanced group that combines strong sulfur binding with minimal structural change. Additional DFT calculations for \ce{SO2} adsorption reveal strong binding and a clear tendency toward dissociation on these clusters, linking electronic states, lattice response, and poisoning strength. These findings offer data-driven guidelines for designing sulfur-tolerant nanocatalysts at the subnanometer scale.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13845v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Lattice models with subsystem/weak non-invertible symmetry-protected topological order</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11419</link><description>arXiv:2505.11419v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Melting is typically viewed as a bulk first-order phase transition that proceeds once nucleation barriers are overcome. Here we demonstrate an interfacially arrested melting regime in molecularly thin crystalline films, where large liquid droplets remain stably trapped well above the bulk melting temperature. Using long-chain alkane films as a model system, we show that melting is suspended by the competition between bulk melting enthalpy and interfacial energy costs associated with capillary confinement. The arrested state is governed by a single control parameter, the product of temperature offset and film thickness, and is independent of droplet size. As a consequence, small temperature variations produce pronounced and reversible changes in droplet morphology, enabling intrinsic thermodynamic amplification of thermal signals. These results reveal a general mechanism by which interfacial constraints can arrest first-order phase transitions in thin films.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.15104v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Floquet-engineered moire quasicrystal patterns of ultracold Bose gases in twisted bilayer optical lattices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21093</link><description>arXiv:2508.21093v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of moire quasicrystal patterns in Bose gasses confined in twisted bilayer optical lattices via Floquet-engineered intralayer atomic interactions. Dynamical evolutions of the total density wave amplitude exhibit the stage for the emergence of moire quasicrystal patterns, where the pattern formation is closely associated with the momenta of collective modes excited by the weak periodic drive. Through analyzing the radial and angular density wave amplitude, we find that these new collective modes are only coupled radially and cannot be decoupled eventually. The symmetry of quasicrystal patterns can be easily manipulated by the modulation frequencies and amplitudes. Reducing the frequencies and increasing the amplitudes can both facilitate lattice symmetry breaking and the subsequent emergence of rotational symmetry. Notably, a twelve-fold quasicrystal pattern emerges under specific parameters, closely resembling the moire quasicrystal in twisted bilayer graphene. The momentum-space distributions also exhibit high rotational symmetry, which is consistent with the real-space patterns at specific evolution times. Our findings establish a new quantum platform for exploring quasicrystals and their symmetry properties in ultracold bosonic systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.21093v5</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Coherent-state path integrals in quantum thermodynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11547</link><description>arXiv:2511.11547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In these notes, we elucidate some subtle aspects of coherent-state path integrals, focusing on their application to the equilibrium thermodynamics of quantum many-particle systems. These subtleties emerge when evaluating path integrals in the continuum, either in imaginary time or in Matsubara-frequency space. Our central message is that, when handled with due care, the path integral yields results identical to those obtained from the canonical Hamiltonian approach. We illustrate this through a pedagogical treatment of several paradigmatic systems: the bosonic and fermionic harmonic oscillators, the single-site Bose-Hubbard and Hubbard models, the weakly-interacting Bose gas with finite-range interactions, and the BCS superconductor with finite-range interactions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.11547v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Noise-induced resonant acceleration of a charge in an intermittent magnetic field: an exact solution for ergodic and non-ergodic fluctuations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15939</link><description>arXiv:2511.15939v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the diffusion of a charged particle in a magnetic field subject to stochastic dichotomous fluctuations. The associated induced electric field gives rise to non-trivial dynamical regimes. In particular, when the mean magnetic field vanishes, the particle remains confined within a finite radius, regardless of the fluctuation statistics. For a non-zero mean field, we show, using a density approach for Poissonian fluctuations, that the particle undergoes an exponential regime of accelerated diffusion. Crucially and more generally, adopting a trajectory-based formalism, we derive an exact analytical solution valid for arbitrary waiting-time distributions, including non-Poissonian and non-ergodic cases. Even rare, abrupt field reversal are shown to trigger exponential acceleration of the particle's diffusion. We demonstrate that this behaviour stems from noise exciting resonance bands present for periodic fluctuations, and we propose noise-induced resonant acceleration as a robust and efficient charge acceleration mechanism, potentially more effective than Fermi's classic model for cosmic acceleration.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.15939v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Les Houches Lecture Notes on Tensor Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24390</link><description>arXiv:2512.24390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor networks provide a powerful new framework for classifying and simulating correlated and topological phases of quantum matter. Their central premise is that strongly correlated matter can only be understood by studying the underlying entanglement structure and its associated (generalised) symmetries. In essence, tensor networks provide a compressed, holographic description of the complicated vacuum fluctuations in strongly correlated systems, and as such they break down the infamous many-body exponential wall.

Abstract: Losses from two-level systems (TLS) associated with amorphous oxides remain one of the primary limitations to the performance of superconducting resonators in quantum information science and precision measurements. Niobium resonators are widely used for these purposes, yet niobium's natural oxide stack contains various types of oxides whose relative contributions to TLS loss have not been clearly distinguished. Here, we use a superconducting 3D microwave cavity to measure chemically pure oxides \ch{Nb2O5} and \ch{NbO2}. Using this approach, we directly compare the loss characteristics of \ch{Nb2O5} and \ch{NbO2}. Our measurements show that the \ch{Nb2O5} oxide exhibits TLS-like power and temperature dependence. Analogous measurements performed on \ch{NbO2} do not show any detectable TLS loss signatures. These results provide direct experimental evidence that \ch{Nb2O5} is the dominant TLS host in niobium resonators and establish a general framework for separating oxide-specific dissipation channels</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06668v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Unavoidable Canonical Nonlinearity Induced by Gaussian Measures Discretization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08381</link><description>arXiv:2601.08381v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When we consider canonical averages for classical discrete systems, typically referred to as substitutional alloys, the map phi from many-body interatomic interactions to thermodynamic equilibrium configurations generally exhibits complicated nonlinearity. This canonical nonlinearity is fundamentally rooted in deviations of the discrete configurational density of states (CDOS) from continuous Gaussian families, and has conventionally been characterized by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence on discrete statistical manifold. Thus, the previous works inevitablly missed intrinsic nonlinearities induced by discretization of Gaussian families, which remains invisible within conventional information-geometric descriptions. In the present work, we identify and quantify such unavoidable canonical nonlinearity by employing the 2-Wasserstein distance with a cost function aligned with the Fisher metric for Gaussian families. We derive an explicit expression for the Wasserstein distance in the limit of vanishing discretization scale d to 0: W2 = d*sqrt(Tr(Gamma)^(-1)/12), where Gamma denotes covariance matrix of the CDOS. We further show that this limiting Wasserstein distance admits a clear geometric interpretation on the statistical manifold, equivalent to a KL divergence associated with the expected parallel translations of continuous Gaussian. Our framework thus provides a transport-information-geometric characterization of discretization-induced nonlinearity in classical discrete systems. In addition, we confirm that this W2-KL equivalence admits a natural generalization beyond Gaussian families, provided that the transport cost is aligned with the Fisher metric of an underlying statistical submanifold and the discretization scale links to infinitesimal parameter variations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08381v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Generalization of anomaly formula for time reversal symmetry in (2+1)D abelian bosonic TQFTs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04990</link><description>arXiv:2508.04990v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study time-reversal symmetry in $(2+1)$D abelian bosonic topological phases. Time-reversal anomalies in such systems are classified by $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in $(3+1)$D, and can be diagnosed via partition functions on manifolds such as $\mathbb{RP}^4$ and $\mathbb{CP}^2$. These partition functions are related by the anomaly formula \begin{equation*}
  Z(\mathbb{RP}^4)\, Z(\mathbb{CP}^2) = \theta_{\mathcal{M}}, \end{equation*} where $\theta_\mathcal{M}$ is the Dehn twist phase associated with the crosscap state.
  Meanwhile, the existence of gapped boundaries is constrained by so-called higher central charges $\xi_n$, which serve as computable invariants encoding obstruction data. Motivated by the known relation $Z(\mathbb{CP}^2) = \xi_1$, we propose a generalization of the anomaly formula that involves both the higher central charges $\xi_n$ and a new time-reversal invariant $\eta_n$. Introducing a distinguished subset $\mathcal{M}^n \subset \mathcal{A}$ of anyons, we establish the relation \begin{equation*}
  \eta_n \cdot \xi_n = \frac{\sum_{a \in \mathcal{M}^n} \theta(a)^n}{\left| \sum_{a \in \mathcal{M}^n} \theta(a)^n \right|}, \end{equation*} which generalizes the known anomaly formula.
  We analyze the algebraic structure of $\mathcal{M}^n$, derive consistency relations it satisfies, and clarify its connection to the original anomaly formula.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.04990v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Effective Free Energy Landscapes and Black Hole Thermodynamic Phase Transitions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25039</link><description>arXiv:2509.25039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent interesting development in the dynamics of black hole phase transitions has been the so-called Gibbs free energy landscape approach. In this formalism, it is assumed that there exists a canonical ensemble of a series of black hole spacetimes with arbitrary horizon radius at a given ensemble temperature. An off-shell Gibbs free energy is defined for every spacetime state in the ensemble, with the horizon radius treated as the order parameter. The minima (maxima) of this function correspond to the various stable (unstable) black hole states. This off-shell Gibbs free energy is then treated as a classical effective drift potential of an associated Fokker-Planck equation used to study the stochastic dynamics of black hole phase transition under thermal fluctuations. Additive noise, which is independent of the black hole size, is assumed in obtaining the Fokker-Planck equation. In this work we extend the previous treatment by considering the effects of multiplicative noise, namely, noise that could scale with black hole size. This leads to an effective free energy function that can be used to study the modification of the thermodynamic phase transition of a black hole system. It is realized that it is generally difficult to form black holes under a multiplicative noise,
  unless the effective and the original free energy become extremal at the same horizon radius. For this latter situation some theoretical noise profiles which are monotonically increasing/deceasing functions of the horizon radius are considered. It is found that stronger noise disfavors the formation of black hole</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.25039v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Maximal Entanglement and Frozen Information: A Unified Framework for Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04535</link><description>arXiv:2601.04535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) are temporal singularities marked by zeros of the Loschmidt echo, yet their underlying quantum-information structure remains elusive. Here, we introduce a momentum-resolved entanglement entropy as a direct probe of DQPTs in translation-invariant free systems. We analytically establish that every critical momentum mode $k^{*}$ associated with a DQPT saturates its entanglement to the maximal value $\ln{2}$, coinciding with the vanishing of the Loschmidt echo. Crucially, we demonstrate that this maximal entanglement universally suppresses information scrambling: a momentum-resolved out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) vanishes identically for all times at $k^{*}$. These three signatures -- Fisher zeros, maximal entanglement, and vanished OTOC -- are proved to be equivalent in both the transverse-field Ising and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models, despite their distinct bipartitions (momentum-pair vs. sublattice). Our results establish a unified, information-theoretic framework for DQPTs, revealing them a points where quantum correlations saturate and information flow halts. This work elevates entanglement and scrambling to central dynamical order parameters, offering a universal perspective on nonequilibrium quantum critically.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04535v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] IEPDYN: Integral-equation formalism of population dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09187</link><description>arXiv:2601.09187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the integral-equation formalism of population dynamics (IEPDYN) to describe the population dynamics of distinct configurational states. According to classical reaction dynamics theory, the probability density associated with a given state obeys the Liouville equation, including influx from and efflux to neighboring states. By introducing a Markov approximation for the crossing of boundaries separating the states, tractable integral equations governing the state populations are derived. Once the time-dependent quantities appearing in these equations are evaluated, the population dynamics on long timescales can be obtained. Because these quantities depend only on a few states in the local neighborhood of a given state, they can be computed using a set of short-timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The IEPDYN method is formulated in continuous time and therefore does not rely on a coarse-grained timescale (lag time). Consequently, kinetic quantities obtained from IEPDYN are free from lag-time dependence, which has been discussed as a limitation in other approaches. We apply the IEPDYN method to the binding and unbinding kinetics of CH$_4$/CH$_4$, Na$^+$/Cl$^-$, and 18-crown-6-ether (crown ether)/K$^+$ in water. For both kinetics, the time constants estimated from the IEPDYN method are almost comparable to those obtained from brute-force MD simulations. The required timescale of each MD trajectory in the IEPDYN method is approximately two orders of magnitude shorter than that in the brute-force MD approach in the crown ether/K$^+$ system. This reduction in the trajectory timescale enables applications to complex binding and unbinding systems whose characteristic timescales are far beyond those directly accessible by brute-force MD simulations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09187v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] NuRedact: Non-Uniform eFPGA Architecture for Low-Overhead and Secure IP Redaction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11770</link><description>arXiv:2601.11770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While logic locking has been extensively studied as a countermeasure against integrated circuit (IC) supply chain threats, recent research has shifted toward reconfigurable-based redaction techniques, e.g., LUT- and eFPGA-based schemes. While these approaches raise the bar against attacks, they incur substantial overhead, much of which arises not from genuine functional reconfigurability need, but from artificial complexity intended solely to frustrate reverse engineering (RE). As a result, fabrics are often underutilized, and security is achieved at disproportionate cost. This paper introduces NuRedact, the first full-custom eFPGA redaction framework that embraces architectural non-uniformity to balance security and efficiency. Built as an extension of the widely adopted OpenFPGA infrastructure, NuRedact introduces a three-stage methodology: (i) custom fabric generation with pin-mapping irregularity, (ii) VPR-level modifications to enable non-uniform placement guided by an automated Python-based optimizer, and (iii) redaction-aware reconfiguration and mapping of target IP modules. Experimental results show up to 9x area reduction compared to conventional uniform fabrics, achieving competitive efficiency with LUT-based and even transistor-level redaction techniques while retaining strong resilience. From a security perspective, NuRedact fabrics are evaluated against state-of-the-art attack models, including SAT-based, cyclic, and sequential variants, and show enhanced resilience while maintaining practical design overheads.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11770v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Domain-specific Hardware Acceleration for Model Predictive Path Integral Control</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12089</link><description>arXiv:2601.12089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately controlling a robotic system in real time is a challenging problem. To address this, the robotics community has adopted various algorithms, such as Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control. The first is difficult to implement on non-linear systems such as unmanned aerial vehicles, whilst the second requires a heavy computational load. GPUs have been successfully used to accelerate MPPI implementations; however, their power consumption is often excessive for autonomous or unmanned targets, especially when battery-powered. On the other hand, custom designs, often implemented on FPGAs, have been proposed to accelerate robotic algorithms while consuming considerably less energy than their GPU (or CPU) implementation. However, no MPPI custom accelerator has been proposed so far. In this work, we present a hardware accelerator for MPPI control and simulate its execution. Results show that the MPPI custom accelerator allows more accurate trajectories than GPU-based MPPI implementations.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12089v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Biological Intuition on Digital Hardware: An RTL Implementation of Poisson-Encoded SNNs for Static Image Classification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12156</link><description>arXiv:2601.12156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of Artificial Intelligence on edge devices (TinyML) is often constrained by the high power consumption and latency associated with traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and their reliance on intensive Matrix-Multiply (MAC) operations. Neuromorphic computing offers a compelling alternative by mimicking biological efficiency through event-driven processing. This paper presents the design and implementation of a cycle-accurate, hardware-oriented Spiking Neural Network (SNN) core implemented in SystemVerilog. Unlike conventional accelerators, this design utilizes a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron model powered by fixed-point arithmetic and bit-wise primitives (shifts and additions) to eliminate the need for complex floating-point hardware. The architecture features an on-chip Poisson encoder for stochastic spike generation and a novel active pruning mechanism that dynamically disables neurons post-classification to minimize dynamic power consumption. We demonstrate the hardware's efficacy through a fully connected layer implementation targeting digit classification. Simulation results indicate that the design achieves rapid convergence (89% accuracy) within limited timesteps while maintaining a significantly reduced computational footprint compared to traditional dense architectures. This work serves as a foundational building block for scalable, energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware on FPGA and ASIC platforms.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12156v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Secure Multi-Path Routing with All-or-Nothing Transform for Network-on-Chip Architectures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13610</link><description>arXiv:2601.13610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring Network-on-Chip (NoC) security is crucial to design trustworthy NoC-based System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures. While there are various threats that exploit on-chip communication vulnerabilities, eavesdropping attacks via malicious nodes are among the most common and stealthy. Although encryption can secure packets for confidentiality, it may introduce unacceptable overhead for resource-constrained SoCs. In this paper, we propose a lightweight confidentiality-preserving framework that utilizes a quasi-group based All-Or-Nothing Transform (AONT) combined with secure multi-path routing in NoC-based SoCs. By applying AONT to each packet and distributing its transformed blocks across multiple non-overlapping routes, we ensure that no intermediate router can reconstruct the original data without all blocks. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method effectively mitigates eavesdropping attacks by malicious routers with negligible area and performance overhead. Our results also reveal that AONT-based multi-path routing can provide 7.3x reduction in overhead compared to traditional encryption for securing against eavesdropping attacks.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13610v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] A Spatial Array for Spectrally Agile Wireless Processing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04182</link><description>arXiv:2512.04182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive MIMO is a cornerstone of next-generation wireless communication, offering significant gains in capacity, reliability, and energy efficiency. However, to meet emerging demands such as high-frequency operation, wide bandwidths, co-existence, integrated sensing, and resilience to dynamic interference, future systems must exhibit both scalability and spectral agility. These requirements place increasing pressure on the underlying processing hardware to be both efficient and reconfigurable. This paper proposes a custom-designed spatial array architecture that serves as a reconfigurable, general-purpose core optimized for a class of wireless kernels that commonly arise in diverse communications and sensing tasks. The proposed spatial array is evaluated against specialized cores for each kernel using High-Level Synthesis (HLS). Both the reconfigurable and specialized designs are synthesized in a 32 nm process to assess latency, throughput, area, and power in realistic processes. The results identify conditions under which general-purpose systolic architectures can approach the efficiency of specialized cores, thereby paving the way toward more scalable and agile systems.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.04182v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] FPGA Co-Design for Efficient N:M Sparse and Quantized Model Inference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24713</link><description>arXiv:2512.24713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of language processing tasks. However, this success comes at the cost of substantial computation and memory requirements, which significantly impedes their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address this challenge, this work introduces an automation framework that leverages weight pruning and low-bit quantization, and presents a hardware-software co-design method that generates accelerators on the Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform. In particular, we implement a unified pipeline that applies N:M structured pruning and 4-bit integer quantization to reduce the memory footprint, followed by optimized dequantization and matrix multiplication to enhance LLM inference on several hardware platforms, including CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs with Dense and 2:4 Sparse Tensor Cores, and a custom systolic-array-based FPGA accelerator. Utilizing 2:4 sparsity combined with quantization on $4096 \times 4096$ matrices, our approach achieves a reduction of up to $4\times$ in weight storage and a $1.71\times$ speedup in matrix multiplication, yielding a $1.29\times$ end-to-end latency reduction compared to dense GPU baselines. Scaling analysis on the LLaMA-7B model further shows that structured sparsity enhances the throughput per token by $1.36\times$. These results demonstrate the synergy of fine-grained N:M sparsity and quantization for enabling efficient and deployable LLM inference, while the proposed FPGA accelerator offers a flexible architectural path for supporting a broader class of sparsity patterns beyond the fixed 2:4 hardware constraints.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24713v2</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Structural basis for the dynamic conformations of AP-4 and its association with ARF1</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68679-8</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 21 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68679-8"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-68679-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;AP-4 assembles non-clathrin coats for membrane trafficking.

Increased activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling is associated with shorter survival in GBM. We looked at expression of NF-κB- or STAT3-related genes in GBM for evidence of a sex-skew in activity. Survival analysis of male and female GBM patients revealed NF-κB- or STAT3-related gene expression was correlated with shorter survival in female patients only.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00136-7?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Interfacial-interaction-modulated topological Hall effect in manganite/iridate heterostructures</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/3/031902/3377799/Interfacial-interaction-modulated-topological-Hall</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Interface-induced magnetic skyrmions, frequently observed in ferromagnetic/heavy metal heterostructures, hold significant promise for applications in spintronic devices. Recent studies have also revealed the presence of skyrmions and the associated topological Hall effect in perovskite oxide heterostructures exhibiting strong spin–orbit coupling. The rich electron correlations and diverse physical properties inherent to perovskite oxides not only enable effective approaches for manipulating skyrmions but also open avenues for multifunctional applications. In this work, we report the topological Hall effect and potential formation of magnetic skyrmions in La&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/SrIrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; 3&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;/5&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; perovskite heterostructures, driven by the interplay among exchange interaction, magnetic anisotropy, and interfacial Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interactions. We demonstrate that the thickness of the SrIrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; layer serves as a key parameter controlling the emergence of the topological Hall signal, mediated through the modulation of magnetic anisotropy energy via interfacial oxygen octahedral tilting. This conclusion is supported by comprehensive investigations of the interfacial microstructure, orbital states, and spin textures. Our findings highlight manganite/iridate heterostructures as a versatile oxide platform for the creation and tuning of non-collinear magnetic structures.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied

Cardiopulmonary comorbidities, bowel preparation-related hypovolemia, and procedural stressors contribute to hemodynamic and respiratory instability.

While the microtubule-associated protein Tau is well characterized in neurons, its role in non-neuronal tissues remains poorly understood. Here, we uncover a critical function of dTau in regulating the morphology and physiology of Drosophila Malpighian tubules, the renal analogs of vertebrates. dTau depletion by null mutation or RNAi, causes cyst-like expansions, uneven tubule diameters, and epithelial disorganization, phenotypes reminiscent of polycystic kidney disease.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00112-4?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Emerging evidence links gut microbial dysbiosis to exacerbating DIHF progression, yet the mechanisms remain elusive.

Finite element analysis comparing the presence/absence of an interlayer, single crystal vs ceramic piezoelectrics, and variations in Ni thickness shows that removing a polymeric adhesive layer increases the induced piezoelectric potential by approximately 13% that single crystals deliver ∼1.3 times higher output than ceramics at identical Ni thickness, and that the response grows, then saturates with Ni thickness under the same excitation condition. Uniform polycrystalline Ni layers with soft magnetic characteristics and controlled thickness were obtained by direct Ni electroplating on PMN-PZT single crystals. Under off-resonance condition, the direct magnetoelectric voltage coefficient increases with Ni thickness and reaches 6.9 V/cm Oe at bias fields below 100 Oe. At the electromechanical resonance, the coefficient is strongly amplified to 1419 V/cm Oe. These results indicate that combining direct Ni electroplating on 32 mode single crystals enhances interfacial stress transfer and magneto-electromechanical conversion, providing a scalable route to high magnetoelectric responses for sensitive magnetic field sensing, low-frequency magnetoelectric antennas, and other applications.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/3/032901/3377690/Enhancing-magnetoelectric-coupling-in-Ni-PMN-PZT</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Using Landau quantization to probe disorder in semiconductor heterostructures</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/3/032101/3377641/Using-Landau-quantization-to-probe-disorder-in</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Understanding scattering mechanisms in semiconductor heterostructures is crucial to reducing sources of disorder and ensuring high yield and uniformity in large spin qubit arrays.

Abstract: We present NAVIS (NAnochannel Velocity and thermal Interfacial Slip), a LAMMPS-Python scripted toolkit for computing the Navier (hydrodynamic) friction coefficient and Kapitza (thermal) resistance at arbitrary solid-fluid interfaces. NAVIS is based on equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) methods for calculating the linear response friction and thermal resistance at the interface, as well as the corresponding velocity and temperature slips. The methodology is based on our previous studies (Hansen, et al., Phys. Rev. E 84, 016313 (2011); Varghese et al., J. Chem. Phys. 154, 184707 (2021); Alosious, et al., J. Chem. Phys. 151, 194502 (2019); Alosious, et al., Langmuir 37, 2355-2361 (2021)), and in this work we provide a pedagogical framework for the implementation of this toolkit on two systems: (i) a water-graphene system (for hydrodynamic slip) and (ii) a water-CNT system (for thermal slip). We provide detailed instructions for performing the EMD simulations using the LAMMPS package and processing the simulation outputs using Python modules to obtain the desired quantities of interest. We expect the toolkit to be useful for computational researchers studying interfacial friction and thermal transport, key factors for efficient and practical applications of nanofluidic systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11391v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Traveling supersolid stripe patterns in spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07322</link><description>arXiv:2506.07322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a traveling supersolid stripe pattern in a spin-orbit-coupled Bose gas. This configuration is associated with an unequal population of the two single-particle energy minima, giving rise to a chemical potential difference that sets the fringe velocity. Unlike stationary stripes, the moving pattern is spin-polarized, with decreasing contrast as the population imbalance increases, eventually leading to stripe melting and transition to the uniform plane-wave phase. The Bogoliubov spectrum of the moving stripes exhibits asymmetry under inversion of the excitation quasimomentum. At high population imbalance, we identify energetic and dynamical instabilities in the spin-phonon mode which transforms to the roton mode of the plane-wave phase as the stripe structure vanishes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.07322v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A molecule with half-M\"obius topology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03516</link><description>arXiv:2507.03516v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stereoisomers of C$_{13}$Cl$_2$ exhibiting helical orbitals around a ring of carbon atoms were synthesized by atom manipulation on NaCl surfaces. We resolved the enantiomeric geometries of the singlet states by atomic force microscopy and mapped their helical orbital densities by scanning tunnelling microscopy. A ${\pi}$-orbital basis of the helical, non-planar singlets that twists by 90{\deg} in one circulation is consistent with a half-M\"obius topology. In such a topology, the ${\pi}$-orbital basis changes sign with respect to two circumnavigations and is periodic with respect to four circumnavigations. A quasiparticle on a ring with this boundary condition could be interpreted as carrying a Berry phase of ${\pi}$/2. We demonstrate reversible switching of the topology, between the two singlets of oppositely threaded half-M\"obius topology, and the planar, topologically trivial, triplet state. Multireference calculations, including large-scale sample-based ab initio calculations executed on quantum hardware, reveal that the switching is associated with a helical pseudo Jahn-Teller effect.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.03516v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Effective field theory for the superfluid vortex lattice from coset construction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13352</link><description>arXiv:2507.13352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Guided by symmetry principles, we construct an effective field theory that captures the long-wavelength dynamics of two-dimensional vortex crystals observed in rotating Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in a harmonic potential. By embedding the system into Newton--Cartan spacetime and analyzing its isometries, we identify the appropriate spacetime symmetry group for trapped condensates at finite angular momentum. After introducing a coarse-grained description of the vortex lattice we consider a homogeneous equilibrium configuration and discuss the associated symmetry breaking pattern. We apply the coset construction method to identify covariant structures that enter the effective action and discuss the physical interpretation of the inverse Higgs constraints. We verify that Kohn's theorem is satisfied within our construction and subsequently focus on the gapless sector of the theory. In this regime, the effective theory accommodates a single gapless excitation--the Tkachenko mode--for which we construct both the leading-order and next-to-leading-order actions, the latter including cubic interaction terms.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.13352v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Suppression of the valence transition in solution-grown single crystals of Eu$_2$Pt$_6$Al$_{15}$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14841</link><description>arXiv:2508.14841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of Eu intermetallic compounds has allowed the exploration of valence fluctuations and transitions in 4f electron systems. Recently, a Eu$_2$Pt$_6$Al$_{15}$ phase synthesized by arc-melting followed by a thermal treatment was reported [M. Radzieowski \textit{et al.}, J Am Chem Soc 140(28), 8950-8957 (2018)], which undergoes a transition upon cooling below 45~K that was interpreted as a valence transition from Eu$^{2+}$ to Eu$^{3+}$. In this paper, we present the discovery of another polymorph of Eu$_2$Pt$_6$Al$_{15}$ obtained by high temperature solution growth, which presents different physical properties than the arc-melted polycrystalline sample. Despite the similarities in crystal structure and chemical composition, the Eu valence transition is almost fully suppressed in the solution-grown crystals, allowing the moments associated with the Eu$^{2+}$ state to order antiferromagnetically at around 14~K. A detailed analysis of the crystal structure using single crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that, although the solution grown crystals are built from the same constituent layers as the arc-melted samples, these layers present a different stacking. The effect of different thermal treatments is also studied. Different anneal procedures did not result in significant changes in the intrinsic properties, and only by arc-melting and quenching the crystals we were able to convert them into the previously reported polymorph.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.14841v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Hierarchy of timescales in a disordered spin-$1/2$ XX ladder</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20078</link><description>arXiv:2509.20078v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the timescales associated with relaxation to equilibrium in closed quantum many-body systems is one of the central focuses in the study of their non-equilibrium dynamics. At late times, these relaxation processes exhibit universal behavior, emerging from the inherent randomness of chaotic Hamiltonians. In this work, we investigate a disordered spin-$1/2$ XX ladder - an experimentally realizable model known for its diffusive dynamics - to explore the connection between transport properties and spectral measures derived solely from the system's energy levels via these relaxation timescales. We begin by analyzing the spectral form factor, which yields the time when the system begins to follow the random matrix theory (RMT) statistics, known as the RMT time. We then determine the Thouless times - the average times for a local excitation to diffuse across the entire finite system - through the linear-response theory for both spin and energy transport. Our numerical results confirm that the RMT time scales quadratically with system size and upper bounds the Thouless times. Interestingly, we also find that, unlike other non-integrable models, spin diffusion proceeds faster than energy diffusion.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.20078v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Unavoidable Canonical Nonlinearity Induced by Gaussian Measures Discretization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08381</link><description>arXiv:2601.08381v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When we consider canonical averages for classical discrete systems, typically referred to as substitutional alloys, the map phi from many-body interatomic interactions to thermodynamic equilibrium configurations generally exhibits complicated nonlinearity. This canonical nonlinearity is fundamentally rooted in deviations of the discrete configurational density of states (CDOS) from continuous Gaussian families, and has conventionally been characterized by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence on discrete statistical manifold. Thus, the previous works inevitablly missed intrinsic nonlinearities induced by discretization of Gaussian families, which remains invisible within conventional information-geometric descriptions. In the present work, we identify and quantify such unavoidable canonical nonlinearity by employing the 2-Wasserstein distance with a cost function aligned with the Fisher metric for Gaussian families. We derive an explicit expression for the Wasserstein distance in the limit of vanishing discretization scale d to 0: W2 = d*sqrt(Tr(Gamma)^(-1)/12), where Gamma denotes covariance matrix of the CDOS. We further show that this limiting Wasserstein distance admits a clear geometric interpretation on the statistical manifold, equivalent to a KL divergence associated with the expected parallel translations of continuous Gaussian. Our framework thus provides a transport-information-geometric characterization of discretization-induced nonlinearity in classical discrete systems. In addition, we confirm that this W2-KL equivalence admits a natural generalization beyond Gaussian families, provided that the transport cost is aligned with the Fisher metric of an underlying statistical submanifold and the discretization scale induces infinitesimal parameter variations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08381v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Structural and Dynamical Crossovers in Dense Electrolytes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03382</link><description>arXiv:2512.03382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrostatic interactions fundamentally govern the structure and transport of electrolytes. In concentrated electrolytes, however, electrostatic and steric correlations, together with ion-solvent coupling, give rise to complex behavior, such as underscreening, that remains challenging to explain despite extensive theoretical effort. Using molecular dynamics simulations of primitive electrolytes with and without space-filling solvent particles, we elucidate the structural and dynamical crossovers and their connection that emerge with increasing salt concentration. Explicit-solvent electrolytes exhibit a screening transition from a charge-dominated dilute regime to a density-dominated concentrated regime, accompanied by dynamical crossovers in ion self-diffusion and ion-pair lifetimes. These dynamical crossovers display a marked discontinuity, unlike the smoother variation of the screening crossover, which originates from short-range ion-counterion structures. The pronounced growth of ionic clusters leads to a percolation transition only at higher concentrations, whereas the onset of the structural and dynamical crossovers is associated primarily with local ion pairing or small aggregates. Both structural and dynamical behaviors are found to depend sensitively on ion-solvent coupling: implicit-solvent electrolytes exhibit a screening transition between two charge-dominated regimes, accompanied by qualitatively distinct dynamical behavior. Finally, we demonstrate that the diffusion-corrected ion-pair lifetime provides a consistent descriptor linking ionic structure and dynamics across electrolyte systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.03382v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] RidgeWalker: Perfectly Pipelined Graph Random Walks on FPGAs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11057</link><description>arXiv:2601.11057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Random Walks (GRWs) offer efficient approximations of key graph properties and have been widely adopted in many applications. However, GRW workloads are notoriously difficult to accelerate due to their strong data dependencies, irregular memory access patterns, and imbalanced execution behavior. While recent work explores FPGA-based accelerators for GRWs, existing solutions fall far short of hardware potential due to inefficient pipelining and static scheduling. This paper presents RidgeWalker, a high-performance GRW accelerator designed for datacenter FPGAs. The key insight behind RidgeWalker is that the Markov property of GRWs allows decomposition into stateless, fine-grained tasks that can be executed out-of-order without compromising correctness. Building on this, RidgeWalker introduces an asynchronous pipeline architecture with a feedback-driven scheduler grounded in queuing theory, enabling perfect pipelining and adaptive load balancing. We prototype RidgeWalker on datacenter FPGAs and evaluated it across a range of GRW algorithms and real-world graph datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that RidgeWalker achieves an average speedup of 7.0x over state-of-the-art FPGA solutions and 8.1x over GPU solutions, with peak speedups of up to 71.0x and 22.9x, respectively.

Abstract: In the modern Systems-on-Chip (SoC), the Advanced eXtensible Interface (AXI) protocol exhibits security vulnerabilities, enabling partial or complete denial-of-service (DoS) through protocol-violation attacks. The recent countermeasures lack a dedicated real-time protocol semantic analysis and evade protocol compliance checks. This paper tackles this AXI vulnerability issue and presents an intelligent hardware monitoring system (IMS) for real-time detection of AXI protocol violations. IMS is a hardware module leveraging neural networks to achieve high detection accuracy. For model training, we perform DoS attacks through header-field manipulation and systematic malicious operations, while recording AXI transactions to build a training dataset. We then deploy a quantization-optimized neural network, achieving 98.7% detection accuracy with &lt;=3% latency overhead, and throughput of &gt;2.5 million inferences/s. We subsequently integrate this IMS into a RISC-V SoC as a memory-mapped IP core to monitor its AXI bus. For demonstration and initial assessment for later ASIC integration, we implemented this IMS on an AMD Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU104 board, showing an overall small hardware footprint (9.04% look-up-tables (LUTs), 0.23% DSP slices, and 0.70% flip-flops) and negligible impact on the overall design's achievable frequency. This demonstrates the feasibility of lightweight, security monitoring for resource-constrained edge environments.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11447v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] CarbonClarity: Understanding and Addressing Uncertainty in Embodied Carbon for Sustainable Computing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01145</link><description>arXiv:2507.01145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embodied carbon footprint modeling has become an area of growing interest due to its significant contribution to carbon emissions in computing. However, the deterministic nature of the existing models fail to account for the spatial and temporal variability in the semiconductor supply chain. The absence of uncertainty modeling limits system designers' ability to make informed, carbon-aware decisions. We introduce CarbonClarity, a probabilistic framework designed to model embodied carbon footprints through distributions that reflect uncertainties in energy-per-area, gas-per-area, yield, and carbon intensity across different technology nodes. Our framework enables a deeper understanding of how design choices, such as chiplet architectures and new vs. old technology node selection, impact emissions and their associated uncertainties. For example, we show that the gap between the mean and 95th percentile of embodied carbon per cm$^2$ can reach up to 1.6X for the 7nm technology node. Additionally, we demonstrate through case studies that: (i) CarbonClarity is a valuable resource for device provisioning, help maintaining performance under a tight carbon budget; and (ii) chiplet technology and mature nodes not only reduce embodied carbon but also significantly lower its associated uncertainty, achieving an 18% reduction in the 95th percentile compared to monolithic designs for the mobile application.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.01145v2</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Statistics makes a difference: Machine learning adsorption dynamics of functionalized cyclooctine on Si(001) at DFT accuracy</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00420A</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, Accepted Manuscript&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00420A, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hendrik  Weiske, Rhyan  Barrett, Ralf Tonner-Zech, Patrick Melix, Julia Westermayr&lt;br /&gt;The interpretation of experiments on reactive semiconductor surfaces requires statistically significant sampling of molecular dynamics, but conventional ab initio methods are limited due to prohibitive computational costs.

Here, we show that HSC exposed to a single 20 mGy dose of irradiation (20 mGy-HSC) exhibit, when proliferating, oxidative stress and altered metabolism associated with increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial Ca2+ overload. These mitochondrial defects arise from immediate and sustained endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, adapted by proliferative 20 mGy-HSC through activation of the eIF2α–ATF4 branch of the unfolded protein response (UPR).</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00113-6?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Disruption of chrna5 blunts aversion and adaptive transcriptomic responses to nicotine and alcohol</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00110-0?rss=yes</link><description>Addiction to nicotine and alcohol continues to be a leading cause of death and loss of productivity.

Mutations in tip-link proteins are a major cause of hereditary hearing loss. Numerous mutations associated with hearing loss are located far from the binding interface and selectively impair hearing, sparing vision and balance.

Abstract: Most methodologies for materials criticality assessment score supply risk and societal importance. Market-based criteria offer quantitative measures for assessment. Here we develop a statistical approach based on a geologic entropy function in which flexible constraints, such as economic, national security related, or regulatory, can be applied. As an example, the formulation describes the relation between elemental price and crustal abundance for selected elements, both important to supply risk. The method may be applicable to parameters resulting from collective decisions exhibiting a highly peaked probability distribution.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09827v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Ultra-Stable Weyl Topology Driven by Magnetic Textures in the Shandite Compound Co3Sn2S(2-x)Sex</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09922</link><description>arXiv:2601.09922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ state-of-the-art first-principles calculations to investigate the shandite compounds Co3Sn2S2, Co3Sn2SeS, and Co3Sn2Se2, which host Weyl fermions and complex magnetic textures. Their magnetic structures are governed primarily by exchange interactions and magnetocrystalline anisotropy, whereas the symmetry-allowed alternating-layer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is found to be negligible. We identify a previously unrecognized spin-chiral interaction (SCI) arising from the kagome lattice topology, which plays a decisive role in stabilizing the experimentally observed magnetic textures. The extracted magnetic parameters reproduce experimental trends, with the SCI emerging as a novel and dominant contribution. The calculated SCI strengths are 0.78 meV, 0.86 meV, and 0.87 meV for Co3Sn2S2, Co3Sn2SeS, and Co3Sn2Se2, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that short-wavelength magnetic textures drive phase transitions of the Weyl nodes, resulting in band flattening and the opening of an emergent gap.

The chains exhibit superinductance, with characteristic wave impedance exceeding $R_{Q} = \hbar/(2e)^{2}$. The planar nature of the junctions results in a large plasma frequency, with no measurable deviations from ideal dispersion up to $12~\mathrm{GHz}$. Internal quality factors decrease sharply with frequency, which we describe with a simple loss model. The possibility of a loss mechanism intrinsic to the superconductor-semiconductor junction is considered.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10023v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Comprehensive Molecular-level Understanding of MgO Hydration through Computational Chemistry</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10186</link><description>arXiv:2601.10186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hydration of magnesium oxide (MgO) to magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)$_2$) is a fundamental solid-surface chemical reaction with significant implications for materials science. Yet its molecular-level mechanism from water adsorption to Mg(OH)$_2$ nucleation and growth remains elusive due to its complex and multi-step nature. Here, we elucidate the molecular process of MgO hydration based on structures of the MgO/water interface obtained by a combined computational chemistry approach of potential-scaling molecular dynamics simulations and first-principles calculations without any a priori assumptions about reaction pathways. The result shows that the Mg$^{2+}$ dissolution follows the dissociative water adsorption. We find that this initial dissolution can proceed exothermically even from the defect-free surface with an average activation barrier of $\sim$12 kcal/mol. This exothermicity depends crucially on the stabilization of the resulting surface vacancy, achieved by proton adsorption onto neighboring surface oxygen atoms. Further Mg$^{2+}$ dissolution then occurs in correlation with proton penetration into the solid. Moreover, we find that the Mg(OH)$_2$ nucleation and growth proceeds according to the dissolution-precipitation mechanism, rather than a solid-state reaction mechanism involving a direct topotactic transformation. In this process, Mg$^{2+}$ ions migrate away from the surface and form amorphous Mg-OH chains as precursors for Mg(OH)$_2$ nucleation. We also demonstrate that sufficient water facilitates the formation of more ordered crystalline nuclei. This computational study provides a comprehensive molecular-level understanding of MgO hydration, representing a foundational step toward elucidating the mechanisms of this class of complex and multi-step solid-surface chemical reactions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10186v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Magnetic field-induced phases in a model S=1 Haldane chain system</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10489</link><description>arXiv:2601.10489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $S=1$ Haldane chain is a one-dimensional (1D) quantum magnet where strong fluctuations result in quantum disordered singlet ground state with a gapped excitation spectrum. The gap magnitude is primarily set by the dominant intrachain interaction ($J_\text{1D}$). An applied magnetic field closes the gap at $B_\text{c1}$ and drives the system into a gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) regime, followed by, at lower temperatures, a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) ground state, persisting up to $B_\text{c2} \propto 4 J_\text{1D}/g\mu_B$. Almost all previously studied experimental realizations of such systems were based on transition-metal complexes which typically suffer from intrinsic anisotropies or large $J_\text{1D}$ values, limiting the access to the full theoretical phase diagram. We report a comprehensive study of TLL and BEC phases in the organic Haldane chain system 3,5-bis(N-tert-butylaminoxyl)-3'-nitrobiphenyl (BoNO). The absence of anisotropy and a moderate $J_\text{1D}$ enable exploration of the complete $B-T$ phase diagram. Through $^1$H nuclear magnetic resonance, combined with theoretical analysis, we characterize the TLL properties, map the BEC phase boundary $T_c (B)$, determine the associated critical exponent $\nu \approx 0.66$ at $B_\text{c2}$, and demonstrate universal quasiparticle scaling in the quantum-critical regime. These results provide full experimental validation of theoretical predictions for field-induced phases in an $S=1$ Haldane chain, made over two decades ago.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10489v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Emergent electric field induced by dissipative sliding dynamics of domain walls in a Weyl magnet</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10638</link><description>arXiv:2601.10638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic motion of topological defects in magnets induces an emergent electric field, as exemplified by the continuous flow of skyrmion vortices. However, the electrodynamics underlying this emergent field remains poorly understood. In this context, magnetic domain walls - one dimensional topological defects with two collective modes, sliding and spin tilt - offer a promising platform for exploration. Here, we demonstrate that the dissipative motion of domain walls under oscillatory current excitation generates an emergent electric field. We image domain patterns and quantify domain wall length under applied magnetic fields in mesoscopic devices based on the magnetic Weyl semimetal NdAlSi. These devices exhibit exceptionally strong domain wall scattering and a pronounced emergent electric field, observed in the imaginary component of the complex impedance. Spin dynamics simulations reveal that domain wall sliding dominates over spin tilting, where the phase delay of the domain wall motion with respect to the driving force impacts the emergent electric field. Our findings establish domain-wall dynamics as a platform for studying emergent electromagnetic fields and motivate further investigations on the coupled motion of magnetic solitons and conduction electrons.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10638v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Emergence and transition of incompressible phases in decorated Landau levels</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10717</link><description>arXiv:2601.10717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show a single Landau level (LL) dressed with periodic electrostatic potentials can realize a plethora of interacting topological phases where the Hall conductivity generally does not equal to the LL filling factor. Their physics can be captured by a minimal model of a delta potential lattice within a single LL, realizing exact zero energy Chern bands (denoted as decorated Landau levels or dLL) gapped from dispersive bands with rich geometric properties. With $p/q$ magnetic fluxes per unit cell, there are $q$ dispersive bands and $p-q$ zero energy bands forming the dLL. When the one-body potential strength dominates the electron-electron interaction, band mixing is suppressed and the dispersion bands consist of ``localized states" with vanishing total Chern number. Nevertheless these dispersive bands can have highly nontrivial Berry curvature distribution, and even non-zero Chern numbers when $q&gt;1$. Interestingly even in the limit of large short range interaction, band mixing between dLL and dispersion bands can be strongly suppressed at low filling factor, leading to robust topological phases within the dLL stabilized by the one-body potential. The dLL and the associated dispersive bands can serve as minimal theoretical models for correlated physics in lattice or moire systems; they are also highly tunable experimental platforms for realizing rich phase diagrams of exotic 2D quantum fluids.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10717v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Parametric RDT approach to computational gap of symmetric binary perceptron</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10628</link><description>arXiv:2601.10628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study potential presence of statistical-computational gaps (SCG) in symmetric binary perceptrons (SBP) via a parametric utilization of \emph{fully lifted random duality theory} (fl-RDT) [96]. A structural change from decreasingly to arbitrarily ordered $c$-sequence (a key fl-RDT parametric component) is observed on the second lifting level and associated with \emph{satisfiability} ($\alpha_c$) -- \emph{algorithmic} ($\alpha_a$) constraints density threshold change thereby suggesting a potential existence of a nonzero computational gap $SCG=\alpha_c-\alpha_a$. The second level estimate is shown to match the theoretical $\alpha_c$ whereas the $r\rightarrow \infty$ level one is proposed to correspond to $\alpha_a$. For example, for the canonical SBP ($\kappa=1$ margin) we obtain $\alpha_c\approx 1.8159$ on the second and $\alpha_a\approx 1.6021$ (with converging tendency towards $\sim 1.59$ range) on the seventh level. Our propositions remarkably well concur with recent literature: (i) in [20] local entropy replica approach predicts $\alpha_{LE}\approx 1.58$ as the onset of clustering defragmentation (presumed driving force behind locally improving algorithms failures); (ii) in $\alpha\rightarrow 0$ regime we obtain on the third lifting level $\kappa\approx 1.2385\sqrt{\frac{\alpha_a}{-\log\left ( \alpha_a \right ) }}$ which qualitatively matches overlap gap property (OGP) based predictions of [43] and identically matches local entropy based predictions of [24]; (iii) $c$-sequence ordering change phenomenology mirrors the one observed in asymmetric binary perceptron (ABP) in [98] and the negative Hopfield model in [100]; and (iv) as in [98,100], we here design a CLuP based algorithm whose practical performance closely matches proposed theoretical predictions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10628v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Madelung hydrodynamics of spin-orbit coupling: action principles, currents, and correlations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10698</link><description>arXiv:2601.10698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exploit the variational and Hamiltonian structures of quantum hydrodynamics with spin to unfold the correlation and torque mechanisms accompanying spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in electronic motion. Using Hamilton's action principle for the Pauli equation, we isolate SOC-induced quantum forces that act on the orbital Madelung--Bohm trajectories and complement the usual force terms known to appear in quantum hydrodynamics with spin. While the latter spin-hydrodynamic forces relate to the quantum geometric tensor (QGT), SOC-induced orbital forces originate from a particular current operator that contributes prominently to the spin current and whose contribution was overlooked in the past. The distinction between different force terms reveals two fundamentally different mechanisms generating quantum spin-orbit correlations. Leveraging the Hamiltonian structure of the hydrodynamic system, we also elucidate spin transport features such as the current shift in the spin Hall effect and the correlation-induced quantum torques. Finally, we illustrate the framework via the Madelung--Rashba equations for planar SOC configurations and propose a particle-based scheme for numerical implementation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10698v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Curvature effect induces topological phase transitions in two dimensional topological superconductor</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12705</link><description>arXiv:2401.12705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, topological superconductors have emerged as a pivotal frontier in condensed matter physics, owing to the exotic properties of Majorana quasiparticles residing on edges, surfaces, and vortex cores. In this work, we investigate a two-dimensional s+p wave noncentrosymmetric superconductor (NCS) with Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on a cylindrical manifold. By employing a thin-layer quantization approach, we derive the effective Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian to elucidate the interplay between surface curvature and topological phase transitions. Our analytical and numerical results demonstrate that the curvature-induced geometric potential (da Costa potential) and the spatial reconfiguration of spin-momentum locking effectively modulate the superconducting gap. From a band theory perspective, we confirm that curvature serves as a critical tuning parameter, capable of driving topological phase transitions by inducing band inversion.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2401.12705v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Enhancing LUT-based Deep Neural Networks Inference through Architecture and Connectivity Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09773</link><description>arXiv:2601.09773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices such as FPGAs requires a careful balance among latency, power, and hardware resource usage, while maintaining high accuracy. Existing Lookup Table (LUT)-based DNNs -- such as LogicNets, PolyLUT, and NeuraLUT -- face two critical challenges: the exponential growth of LUT size and inefficient random sparse connectivity. This paper presents SparseLUT, a comprehensive framework that addresses these challenges through two orthogonal optimizations. First, we propose an architectural enhancement that aggregates multiple PolyLUT sub-neurons via an adder, significantly reducing LUT consumption by 2.0x-13.9x and lowering inference latency by 1.2x-1.6x, all while maintaining comparable accuracy. Building upon this foundation, we further introduce a non-greedy training algorithm that optimizes neuron connectivity by selectively pruning less significant inputs and strategically regrowing more effective ones. This training optimization, which incurs no additional area and latency overhead, delivers consistent accuracy improvements across benchmarks -- achieving up to a 2.13% gain on MNIST and 0.94% on Jet Substructure Classification compared to existing LUT-DNN approaches.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09773v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Architectural Classification of XR Workloads: Cross-Layer Archetypes and Implications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10463</link><description>arXiv:2601.10463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge and mobile platforms for augmented and virtual reality, collectively referred to as extended reality (XR) must deliver deterministic ultra-low-latency performance under stringent power and area constraints. However, the diversity of XR workloads is rapidly increasing, characterized by heterogeneous operator types and complex dataflow structures. This trend poses significant challenges to conventional accelerator architectures centered around convolutional neural networks (CNNs), resulting in diminishing returns for traditional compute-centric optimization strategies. Despite the importance of this problem, a systematic architectural understanding of the full XR pipeline remains lacking. In this paper, we present an architectural classification of XR workloads using a cross-layer methodology that integrates model-based high-level design space exploration (DSE) with empirical profiling on commercial GPU and CPU hardware. By analyzing a representative set of workloads spanning 12 distinct XR kernels, we distill their complex architectural characteristics into a small set of cross-layer workload archetypes (e.g., capacity-limited and overhead-sensitive). Building on these archetypes, we further extract key architectural insights and provide actionable design guidelines for next-generation XR SoCs. Our study highlights that XR architecture design must shift from generic resource scaling toward phase-aware scheduling and elastic resource allocation in order to achieve greater energy efficiency and high performance in future XR systems.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10463v1</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Science: Table of Contents] Structural Basis of the Membrane Association by the Conserved RocS Membrane‐Targeting Sequence in Streptococcus</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202521132?af=R</link><description>Advanced Science, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Science: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 04:40:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/advs.202521132</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Environmental enrichment and physical exercise prevent stress-induced social avoidance and blood-brain barrier alterations via Fgf2</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-68058-9</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 16 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-68058-9"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-025-68058-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Chronic stress disrupts the brain vasculature and contributes to mood disorders, but mechanisms of resilience remain unclear.

Many potent class I HDAC inhibitors display slow- and tight-binding kinetics, which profoundly influence their efficacy and pharmacodynamics. In particular, their dissociation rate (off kinetic) is critical, since prolonged target engagement greatly influences drug efficacy in vivo. However, the off-kinetics of HDAC inhibitors are often overlooked in the early stages of drug development. Here, we investigated the dissociation kinetics of tucidinostat, trapoxin A, and TNG260 in comparison to the pan-HDAC inhibitor vorinostat. Using biochemical 100-fold jump dilution assays, NanoBRET assays, and cellular washout experiments, we characterized the dissociation of these compounds from purified proteins and in a cellular context. Tucidinostat showed moderately slow off-kinetics, while the clinical candidate TNG260 demonstrated pronounced tight-binding properties. Trapoxin A displayed remarkable discrepancies between assays, as it showed fast dissociation kinetics in the biochemical assay, but tight-binding properties in a cellular setting. These findings not only address the previously unexplored dissociation kinetics of two clinically relevant inhibitors, but also underscore the importance of comprehensive kinetic profiling of novel HDAC inhibitors in cellular models.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-3q28h?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Auditing Domain Alignment in Latent Representations for Cross-Domain Materials Machine Learning</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-d4qw9?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Machine learning models are increasingly applied to heterogeneous materials datasets spanning different synthesis routes, measurement protocols, and structural classes. Although multi-task and representation-learning approaches are commonly used to improve predictive performance, the latent representations learned by such models are rarely examined directly, allowing domain misalignment to remain hidden until model transfer fails. Here, we present a practical, representation-level framework for auditing domain alignment in latent spaces learned by multi-task neural networks for materials property prediction. Using porous carbon materials and metal–organic frameworks as a representative cross-domain case study, we analyze a shared latent space trained across multiple target properties and regularization strategies. Global and local dimensionality-reduction visualizations are combined with quantitative measures of domain separability and latent–target correlation structure to assess alignment quality. We find that domain-alignment objectives induce measurable geometric reorganization and partial large-scale mixing in latent space, while domain identity remains locally recoverable and physically interpretable monotonic associations between latent dimensions and target properties are preserved. These diagnostics reveal structural differences in learned representations that are not apparent from conventional performance metrics alone and enable model comparison based on latent-space geometry rather than predictive accuracy. The proposed auditing framework is model-agnostic and can be readily integrated into existing materials machine learning workflows, providing a practical tool for improving robustness and interpretability in cross-domain materials modeling.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-d4qw9?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

However, high-quality open-source digital pKa datasets are scarce, which limits the ability for researchers to search for properties of individual compounds, while also limiting the potential of data-driven predictive models. In this work, we release the IUPAC Digitized pKa Dataset, a digital version of a critically-assessed collection of data compiled up to 1970. The dataset includes metadata such as temperature, measurement method, assessed reliability of data, and chemical identifiers such as SMILES and InChI strings. The dataset spans 24,222 entries across 10,564 unique molecules, making it the largest FAIR open-source dataset publicly available for aqueous pKa data. Herein, we detail the data digitization and checking process, and assess the informational space spanned by the data. We compare the new digital dataset to other widely-used datasets. Several pKa predictors have been trained using these other datasets, but often have not been reliably tested due to overlap between the training and test data. We use the data to train a macroscopic pKa predictor and determine its accuracy using overlap-free test data.

Here we describe a proximity-driven molecular framework that couples DBP–DNA recognition to DNA strand displacement reactions, enabling DNA-binding proteins to act as sequence-selective inputs for synthetic nucleic acid reaction pathways without modification of the protein scaffold. In our design, protein binding induces spatial colocalization of DNA components, triggering conditional generation of functional nucleic acid outputs through proximity-mediated strand displacement. Using representative DBPs, including EGR1, YY1, and p53, we connect protein recognition to DNA strand displacement, activation of a fluorogenic RNA aptamer, regulation of CRISPR–Cas12a and Cas13 activity, and coordination of multistep CRISPR cascades. A defining feature of this strategy is the decoupling of molecular recognition from downstream function, which avoids structural and thermodynamic constraints associated with switch-based designs. These results demonstrate a general proximity-based approach for integrating DNA-binding proteins into programmable molecular architectures.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-nszs1?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Synthesis of microbial-derived octadecanoids</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-x521p?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The gut microbiome is increasingly being shown to exert multiple biological effects upon the host. This activity can occur via the production of microbial-derived metabolites. Gut bacteria have been demonstrated to convert dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) into oxygenated metabolites called oxylipins, which can exert potent lipid mediator functions. The products derived from C-18 fatty acids are collectively known as octadecanoids and have been shown to associate with multiple disorders including allergy and metabolic dysregulation. To study the role of these compounds, there is a need to prepare sufficient quantities for functional investigations. This study presents the successful synthesis of 17 octadecanoids possessing a hydroxy group (n=9) or a ketone (n=8) on the carbon on the 10- or 13-positions. The products of these two series were prepared for the linoleic acid (LA), α-linolenic acid (ALA) and γ- linolenic acid (GLA) pathways. The new synthetic strategies developed here provided 17 putative microbial metabolites of C-18 PUFAs with high purities, in 5-13 steps and overall yields from 1.5-37%. To study the biological formation of these compounds, the parent PUFAs (LA, ALA, GLA) were fed to cultures of Enterococcus faecalis U150 and Lactobacillus acidophilus CCUG 5917, and the octadecanoid products were measured by chiral supercritical fluid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (SFC-MS/MS). The compounds containing a hydroxy group on the 10- or 13-position are racemic, forming 9 enantiomeric pairs. Accordingly, of the 17 compounds synthesized, 9 were chiral and 8 were achiral resulting in 26 compounds in total. An additional 7 commercial bacteria-derived octadecanoids were measured, to provide a screen of 33 compounds. Generally, PUFA supplementation resulted in selective formation of the associated octadecanoids. Of the 33 studied compounds, 16 were observed to be formed by E. faecalis and 13 by L. acidophilus. These findings demonstrate the bacteria species-specific formation of octadecanoids, which may have ramifications for associated biological response in the host.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-x521p?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Nature] Gifted dogs learn new words by overhearing humans</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00112-y</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature, Published online: 16 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00112-y"&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-026-00112-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Particularly talented canines have sociolinguistic skills akin to those of young toddlers.</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00112-y</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Glutamatergic projection neurons in the basal forebrain underlie learned olfactory associational valence assignments</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68313-7</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 16 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68313-7"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-68313-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Neural mechanisms underlying motivation-driven behaviors are not fully understood.

Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate the generation of multiple three-magnon splitting processes in an in-plane magnetized submicron Bi-YIG disk using micro-focused Brillouin light scattering. The low magnetic damping and strong magneto-optical response of BiYIG enable the detection of nonlinear spin-wave interactions at low threshold powers. By tuning the in-plane static magnetic field, excitation frequency, and power, we observe the generation of three pairs of secondary modes symmetrically distributed around half the excitation frequency. Time-resolved BLS measurements present temporal dynamics and threshold behavior associated with the successive activation of three-magnon pairs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09177v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Gap solitons of the Wannier and Bloch types in spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates with a moir\'{e} lattice</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09242</link><description>arXiv:2601.09242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gap solitons (GSs) bifurcating from flat bands, which may be represented in terms of Wannier functions, have garnered significant interest due to their strong localization with extremely small norms. Moir\'{e} lattices (MLs), with multiple flat bands, offer an appropriate platform for creating such solitons. We explore the formation mechanism and stability of GSs in spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates under the combined action of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and an ML potential. We identify five Wannier-type GS families bifurcating from the lowest five energy bands in the spectrum induced by the ML with sufficiently large period and depth. These fundamental GSs serve as basic elements for constructing more complex Wannier-type GS states. Reducing the lattice period and depth triggers a transition from the Wannier-type GSs to ones of the Bloch type, the latter exhibiting higher norm thresholds and pronounced spatial broadening near edges of the energy bands. In addition to tuning the lattice-potential parameters, adjusting the SOC strength can also modulate the flatness of energy bands and enhance the localization of gap solitons, enabling reversible transitions between the GSs of the Wannier and Bloch types. Distinctive properties of GSs in the quasiperiodic ML are uncovered too. Thus, we propose the theoretical foundation for the creation of and manipulations with strongly localized GSs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09242v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Tunnel-Barrier-Engineered Ultrafast Demagnetization and Spin Transport in Graphene-Based Heterostructures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09284</link><description>arXiv:2601.09284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterostructures combining graphene with 3d transition metal ferromagnets (FMs) enable various spin-based phenomena at ultrafast timescales. However, challenges such as the interfacial impedance mismatch, FM deposition-induced defect generation, and interface modification by interfacial coupling or hybridization can impede their functionalization for spin-orbitronics. In this work, we utilize insulating TiOx barrier layers (BLs) to modify the interfacial spin conductance structurally, disentangle spin pumping and magnetic proximity effects (MPE), and establish external control over ultrafast magnetization dynamics in single-layer graphene/TiOx/Co systems. All-optical time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements of femtosecond to nanosecond spin dynamics reveal systematic tunability of ultrafast magnetic parameters via barrier engineering. The thickness-dependent damping modulation in Co indicates strong spin pumping, with interfacial spin transparency close to half its physical limit in the presence of an ultrathin BL, where MPE is eliminated. Our results show that appropriately chosen ultrathin BLs can prevent interfacial alterations from ferromagnetic metals, facilitating efficient spin detection in graphene and enhancing control over spin angular momentum dissipation in graphene/FM interfaces.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09284v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A first passage problem for a Poisson counting process with a linear moving boundary</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09296</link><description>arXiv:2601.09296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time to first crossing for the Poisson counting process with respect to a linear moving barrier with offset is a classic problem, although key results remain scattered across the literature and their equivalence is often unclear. Here we present a unified and pedagogical treatment of two approaches: the direct time-domain approach based on path-decomposition techniques and the Laplace-domain approach based on the Pollaczek-Spitzer formula. Beyond streamlining existing derivations and establishing their consistency, we leverage the complementary nature of the two methods to obtain new exact analytical results. Specifically, we derive an explicit large deviation function for the first-passage time distribution in the subcritical regime and closed-form expressions for the conditional mean first-passage time for arbitrary offset. Despite its simplicity, this first crossing process exhibits non-trivial critical behavior and provides a rare example where all the main results of interest can be derived exactly.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09296v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The Diffusion Kinetics of Ba Cations in Perovskite BaTiO$_3$: A Combined Tracer Diffusion and Metadynamics Study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09344</link><description>arXiv:2601.09344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tracer diffusion experiments and metadynamics (MtD) simulations were used to study the diffusion of Ba cations in the cubic phase of the perovskite oxide BaTiO$_3$. $^{130}$BaTiO$_3$ thin films were used as diffusion sources to introduce barium tracer diffusion profiles into single-crystal samples at temperatures $1348 \leq T/\mathrm{K} \leq 1498$. The $^{130}$Ba profiles were determined by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, and then analysed to yield Ba tracer diffusion coefficients ($D_\mathrm{Ba}^\ast$). MtD simulations were performed in order to obtain barium-vacancy diffusion coefficients ($D_\mathrm{v_{Ba}}$) for selected vacancy mechanisms as a function of temperature. $D_\mathrm{v_{Ba}}$ is predicted to be increased significantly by an adjacent oxygen vacancy, and even more, by an adjacent titanium vacancy. From the combined consideration of $D_\mathrm{Ba}^\ast$ and $D_\mathrm{v_{Ba}}$, we conclude that Ba diffusion in these samples occurred most probably by the migration of defect associates, and not by the migration of isolated barium vacancies. More generally, our results draw attention to the dangers of relying solely on activation enthalpies to interpret diffusion data.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09344v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Molecular-based coordination polymer as reversible and precise acetonitrile electro-optical readout</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09370</link><description>arXiv:2601.09370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient detection of harmful organic volatile compounds is a major health and environmental need in industrialized societies. Tailor-made metal-organic frameworks and other coordination polymers are emerging as promising sensing molecular materials thanks to their responsivity to a wide variety of external stimuli, and could be used to complement conventional sensors. Here, a non-porous crystalline 1D Fe(II) coordination polymer acting as a porous acetonitrile host is presented. The desorption of interstitial acetonitrile is accompanied by magneto-structural transitions easily detectable in the optical and electronic properties of the material. The structural switch and therefore its (opto)electronic readout are reversible under exposition of the crystal to acetonitrile vapor. Coordination polymers can be versatile sensors for volatile acetonitrile and potentially other organic compounds.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09370v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dynamical Stabilization of Inverted Magnetization and Antimagnons by Spin Injection in an Extended Magnetic System</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09569</link><description>arXiv:2601.09569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical perturbations can modify the energy landscape of a physical system, such that unstable equilibrium configurations become stable when subject to an external drive. The magnetic analog of such dynamical stabilization corresponds to saturation of the magnetization against an external field. Here we report dynamical stabilization of the magnetization in thin film bismuth-substituted yttrium iron garnet by spin current injection from an adjacent Pt layer. Magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements demonstrate magnetization reversal against magnetic fields up to 3000 times larger than the film's coercivity once the spin injection surpasses a critical threshold associated with negative damping. Micromagnetic simulations reveal that this process is mediated by the excitation of a large population of incoherent magnons with non-zero wave vector, leading to a transient shortening and subsequent stabilization of the inverted magnetization. The elementary excitations of the high-energy inverted magnetization state are shown to be antimagnons, quasi-particles carrying opposite energy and spin relative to magnons. Our results further reveal how the system's size and minimization of nonlinear magnon scattering processes play a key role in dynamical stabilization, opening new avenues for magnetic state control beyond conventional magnetization switching. Dissipation-driven phase transitions in large-area magnetic systems provide a solid-state platform to study magnonic analogs of relativistic phenomena, such as Klein tunneling and black holes, as well as spin-wave amplification and lasing.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09569v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Controlling thermal conductivity in harmonic chains with correlated mass and bond disorder: Analytical approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09683</link><description>arXiv:2601.09683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate heat transport in one-dimensional harmonic chains with mass disorder and weak bond disorder, coupled at both ends to oscillator heat baths through weak impedance mismatches. The model incorporates correlations in mass disorder, in bond disorder, and between the two. We find that the scaling of thermal conductivity $\kappa$ with system size $N$ is determined solely by either mass disorder or bond disorder. This indicates that cross-correlations between the two types of disorder play no important role in the scaling behavior of $\kappa$. Consequently, by tuning the self-correlations, it is possible to control how the thermal conductivity scales with the system size. Such control could have potential applications in thermoelectric devices and thermal insulation technologies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09683v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Probabilistic Computers for MIMO Detection: From Sparsification to 2D Parallel Tempering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09037</link><description>arXiv:2601.09037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic computers built from p-bits offer a promising path for combinatorial optimization, but the dense connectivity required by real-world problems scales poorly in hardware. Here, we address this through graph sparsification with auxiliary copy variables and demonstrate a fully on-chip parallel tempering solver on an FPGA. Targeting MIMO detection, a dense, NP-hard problem central to wireless communications, we fit 15 temperature replicas of a 128-node sparsified system (1,920 p-bits) entirely on-chip and achieve bit error rates significantly below conventional linear detectors. We report complete end-to-end solution times of 4.7 ms per instance, with all loading, sampling, readout, and verification overheads included. ASIC projections in 7 nm technology indicate about 90 MHz operation with less than 200 mW power dissipation, suggesting that massive parallelism across multiple chips could approach the throughput demands of next-generation wireless systems. However, sparsification introduces sensitivity to the copy-constraint strength. Employing Two-Dimensional Parallel Tempering (2D-PT), which exchanges replicas across both temperature and constraint dimensions, we demonstrate over 10X faster convergence without manual parameter tuning. These results establish an on-chip p-bit architecture and a scalable algorithmic framework for dense combinatorial optimization.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09037v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A theory of state-to-state transitions based on the framework of classical reaction dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09187</link><description>arXiv:2601.09187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method to describe the population dynamics of distinct configurational states based on a continuous-time description of state-to-state transitions. According to classical reaction dynamics theory, the probability density associated with a given state obeys the Liouville equation, the probability density associate d with a given state obeys the Li ouville equation, including influx from and efflux to neighboring states. By introducing a Markov approximation for the crossing of boundaries separating the states, tractable integral equations governing the state populations are derived. Once the time-dependent quantities appearing in these equations are evaluated, the population dynamics on long timescales can be obtained. Because these quantities depend only on a few states in the local neighborhood of a given state, they can be computed using a set of short-timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We apply the present method to the binding and unbinding kinetics of CH$_4$/CH$_4$, Na$^+$/Cl$^-$, and 18-crown-6-ether (crown ether)/K$^+$ in water. For both kinetics, the time constants estimated from the present method are almost comparable to those obtained from brute-force MD simulations. The required timescale of each MD trajectory in the present method is approximately two orders of magnitude shorter than that in the brute-force MD approach in the crown ether/K$^+$ system. This reduction in the trajectory timescale enables applications to
  complex binding and unbinding sy stems whose characteristic timescales a re far beyond those directly acce ssible by brute-force MD simulati ons.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09187v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spin-degenerate bulk bands and topological surface states associated with Dirac nodal lines in RuO2</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10649</link><description>arXiv:2501.10649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets are a novel platform to realize exotic electromagnetic properties distinct from those of conventional ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. We report results of micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on RuO2, in which its altermagnetic nature has been under fierce debate in connection with crystal-orientation-dependent spintronic functionalities. By elucidating the band structure of the (100), (110) and (101) surfaces of a bulk single crystal using micro-ARPES, we found that, irrespective of the surface orientation, the experimental band structures show a good agreement with the bulk-band calculations for the nonmagnetic phase, but display a severe disagreement with those for the antiferromagnetic phase. Moreover, spin-resolved ARPES signifies a negligible spin polarization in the bulk bands, suggesting the absence of antiferromagnetism and altermagnetic spin splitting. In addition, we identified a nearly flat surface band and a dispersive one near the Fermi level at the (100)/(110) and (101) surfaces, respectively. Our first-principles calculations and analysis of Berry phase attribute these states to the topological surface bands emerging from the bulk Dirac nodal lines around the Fermi level. Our results indicate that such topological surface/interface states must be considered to understand the spintronic functionalities of RuO2, and may provide new insights into its catalytic characteristics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.10649v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Limits of Information Flow Between Classically Interacting Particles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18652</link><description>arXiv:2501.18652v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pinning down a precise understanding of information flow within physical interactions remains a central concern to fields like stochastic thermodynamics and quantum information science. In both spheres a careful accounting of bits (or qubits) enables a deeper understanding of the physical nature of information. In this work we propose a measure of information flow as a saddle-point solution of the mutual information. This approach places a lower bound on the channel capacity between a particle and an interacting environment. The measure is given by P/2E in nats/sec, with P the average power flux between the particle and its environment, and E the initial average energy of the particle, all computed in a frame where the particle has zero average momentum. We use a communication theory lens to suggest an associated channel analogy, in which this bound is interpreted as a signal-to-noise ratio. We find that this measure can also quantify early-time information flow for a particle interacting with a thermal bath.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.18652v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Linear approximations of large deviations: Cubic diffusion test</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18977</link><description>arXiv:2508.18977v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method for approximating the large deviation rate function of time-integrated observables of diffusion processes, used in statistical physics to characterize the fluctuations of nonequilibrium systems. The method is based on linearizing the effective process associated with the large deviations of the process and observable considered, and is tested for a simple one-dimensional nonlinear diffusion model involving a cubic drift. The results show that the linear approximation compares well with the exact rate function, especially in the large fluctuation regime, and that its accuracy is related to the way the linearized process localizes in space. Possible extensions and applications to more complex diffusion models are proposed for future work.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.18977v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Current-induced molecular dissociation: Topological insulators as robust reaction platforms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02831</link><description>arXiv:2509.02831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing interest in topological materials with symmetry-protected surface states as catalytic platforms has sparked the emerging field of topocatalysis. As robust transport is one of the key features of topological insulators, here we explore current-induced molecular dissociation in a transport setup. Using the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, we compare how the occupancies of bonding and antibonding levels, as well as the associated electronic forces in a diatomic molecule, are affected when the molecule is coupled to either a metallic (graphene) or a topological (Kane-Mele) substrate. We find a greater dissociative capability in the topological substrate than in graphene, a difference mainly attributed to the localized nature of the edge states. The inclusion of vacancy disorder within the substrate further enhances this disparity in the dissociative force. Our findings highlight the role of topological protection in molecular dissociation under non-equilibrium conditions, pointing to new opportunities for robust catalysis in topological materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.02831v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Euler band topology in superfluids and superconductors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06406</link><description>arXiv:2509.06406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real band topology often appears in systems with space-time inversion symmetry and is characterized by invariants such as the Euler and second Stiefel-Whitney classes. Here, we examine the generic band topology of Bogoliubov de-Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonians with $C_{2z}T$ symmetry, where $C_{2z}$ and $T$ are twofold rotation about the $z$ axis and time-reversal symmetries, respectively. We discuss the Euler band topology of superfluids and superconductors in the DIII and CI Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes, where the Euler class serves as an integer-valued topological invariant of the $4\times4$ BdG Hamiltonian. Using expressions for the Euler class under $n$-fold rotational symmetry, we derive formulas relating the Euler class to previously known topological invariants of class DIII and CI systems. We demonstrate that three-dimensional class DIII topological phases with an odd winding number, including the B phase of superfluid Helium 3, are topological superconductors or superfluids with a nontrivial Euler class. We refer to these as Euler superconductors or superfluids. Specifically, the $^3$He-B superfluid in a magnetic field is identified as an Euler superfluid. Three-dimensional class CI topological phases with twice an odd winding number are also Euler superconductors or superfluids. When spatial inversion symmetry is present, class CI superconductors with a nontrivial Euler class exhibit superconducting nodal lines with a linking structure. This phenomenon is demonstrated using a model of a three-dimensional $s_\pm$-wave superconductor. These findings provide a unified framework for exploring Euler band topology in superfluids and superconductors, connecting various phenomena associated with $T$-breaking perturbations, including Majorana Ising susceptibility and higher-order topology.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.06406v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Data-Driven Stochastic Modeling of Schooling Fish: From Collective Dynamics to Individual Fluctuations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08630</link><description>arXiv:2509.08630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective motion in animal groups emerges from the interplay between individual variability and social coordination, yet connecting these scales quantitatively has remained a major challenge.Using high-resolution trajectories of schooling fish, we infer a data-driven stochastic framework that reproduces with remarkable accuracy the behavior of real fish schools. We decompose motion into two coupled components: the dynamics of the school's center of mass (or centroid), modeled as an active Brownian particle confined by the tank, and individual motions relative to that center, described by stochastic equations with data-inferred mean-field potentials and multiplicative noise. Simulations of these equations produce synthetic schools that quantitatively match real ones across multiple observables, including burst-and-coast dynamics, polarization, and spatial cohesion. This minimal, predictive framework bridges experiment and theory, showing that the collective dynamics of animal groups can be faithfully reconstructed from first principles directly from data.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.08630v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] N\'{e}el vector and Rashba SOC effects on RKKY interaction in 2D $d$-wave altermagnets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26285</link><description>arXiv:2509.26285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets possess two key features: non-relativistic alternating spin splitting (i.e., altermagnetism) and a material-dependent N\'{e}el vector. The former naturally coexists with Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in real materials on substrates, prompting the question of how SOC affects the magnetic properties of altermagnets. The latter is crucial for information storage, making it essential to determine its orientation. To address these issues, we study the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction in two-dimensional (2D) $d$-wave altermagnets by independently varying the N\'{e}el vector orientation and the SOC strength. Our results demonstrate that the N\'{e}el vector orientation can be accurately determined via the Ising term without SOC, or qualitatively inferred via the DM terms with SOC. Moreover, we observe a novel Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) component distinct from previous reports, whose emergence is attributed to the synergy between altermagnetism and SOC. Additionally, through tuning SOC strength, we reveal the evolution of the RKKY spin models governed by five distinct mechanisms: the spin model may be determined solely by altermagnetism, solely by SOC, or solely by the kinetic term; alternatively, altermagnetism may coincidentally yield the same moderately anisotropic spin model as SOC, or compete with SOC to produce a spin model with maximal anisotropy. Beyond SOC strength, which mechanism operates also relies on the N\'{e}el vector orientation and impurity configurations. All results are numerically verified. These findings -- which were inaccessible in prior studies due to the limitations of first-order SOC expansion and fixed N\'{e}el vector orientation -- provide important new insights into the magnetic properties of altermagnets.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.26285v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spin-spiral instability of the Nagaoka ferromagnet in the crossover between square and triangular lattices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05226</link><description>arXiv:2510.05226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the hard-core Fermi-Hubbard model in the crossover between square and triangular lattices near half-filling. As was recognized by Nagaoka in the 1960s, on the square lattice the presence of a single hole leads to ferromagnetic spin ordering. On the triangular lattice, geometric frustration instead leads to a spin-singlet ground state, which can be associated with a 120-degree spiral order. On lattices which interpolate between square and triangular, there is a phase transition at which the ferromagnetic order becomes unstable to a spin spiral. We model this transition, finding the exact location of the spin-spiral instability.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.05226v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Learning About Learning: A Physics Path from Spin Glasses to Artificial Intelligence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07635</link><description>arXiv:2601.07635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hopfield model, originally inspired by spin-glass physics, occupies a central place at the intersection of statistical mechanics, neural networks, and modern artificial intelligence. Despite its conceptual simplicity and broad applicability -- from associative memory to near-optimal solutions of combinatorial optimization problems -- it is rarely integrated into standard undergraduate physics curricula. In this paper, we present the Hopfield model as a pedagogically rich framework that naturally unifies core topics from undergraduate statistical physics, dynamical systems, linear algebra, and computational methods. We provide a concise and illustrated theoretical introduction grounded in familiar physics concepts, analyze the model's energy function, dynamics, and pattern stability, and discuss practical aspects of simulation, including a freely available simulation code. To support instruction, we conclude with classroom-ready example problems designed to mirror research practice. By explicitly connecting fundamental physics to contemporary AI applications, this work aims to help prepare physics students to understand, apply, and critically engage with the computational tools increasingly central to research, industry, and society.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07635v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Unavoidable Canonical Nonlinearity Induced by Gaussian Measures Discretization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08381</link><description>arXiv:2601.08381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When we consider canonical averages for classical discrete systems, typically referred to as substitutional alloys, the map phi from many-body interatomic interactions to thermodynamic equilibrium configurations generally exhibits complicated nonlinearity. This canonical nonlinearity is fundamentally rooted in deviations of the discrete configurational density of states (CDOS) from continuous Gaussian families, and has conventionally been characterized by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence on discrete statistical manifold. Thus, the previous works inevitablly missed intrinsic nonlinearities induced by discretization of Gaussian families, which remains invisible within conventional information-geometric descriptions. In the present work, we identify and quantify such unavoidable canonical nonlinearity by employing the 2-Wasserstein distance with a cost function aligned with the Fisher metric for Gaussian families. We derive an explicit expression for the Wasserstein distance in the limit of vanishing discretization scale d to 0: W2 = d*sqrt(Tr(Gamma)^(-1)/12), where Gamma denotes covariance matrix of the CDOS. We further show that this limiting Wasserstein distance admits a clear geometric interpretation on the statistical manifold, equivalent to a KL divergence associated with the expected parallel translations of continuous Gaussian. Our framework thus provides a transport-information-geometric characterization of discretization-induced nonlinearity in classical discrete systems. In addition, we confirm that this W2-KL equivalence admits a natural generalization beyond Gaussian families, provided that the transport cost is aligned with the Fisher metric of an underlying statistical submanifold and the discretization scale induces infinitesimal parameter variations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08381v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Hydrogen production from blended waste biomass: pyrolysis, thermodynamic-kinetic analysis and AI-based modelling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15960</link><description>arXiv:2510.15960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work contributes to advancing sustainable energy and waste management strategies by investigating the thermochemical conversion of food-based biomass through pyrolysis, highlighting the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in enhancing process modelling accuracy and optimization efficiency. The main objective is to explore the potential of underutilized biomass resources, such as spent coffee grounds (SCG) and date seeds (DS), for sustainable hydrogen production. Specifically, it aims to optimize the pyrolysis process while evaluating the performance of these resources both individually and as blends. Proximate, ultimate, fibre, TGA/DTG, kinetic, thermodynamic, and Py-Micro GC analyses were conducted for pure DS, SCG, and blends (75% DS - 25% SCG, 50% DS - 50% SCG, 25% DS - 75% SCG). Blend 3 offered superior hydrogen yield potential but had the highest activation energy (Ea: 313.24 kJ/mol), while Blend 1 exhibited the best activation energy value (Ea: 161.75 kJ/mol). The kinetic modelling based on isoconversional methods (KAS, FWO, Friedman) identified KAS as the most accurate. These approaches provide a detailed understanding of the pyrolysis process, with particular emphasis on the integration of artificial intelligence. An LSTM model trained with lignocellulosic data predicted TGA curves with exceptional accuracy (R^2: 0.9996-0.9998).</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.15960v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Relational Hoare Logic for High-Level Synthesis of Hardware Accelerators</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09217</link><description>arXiv:2601.09217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-level synthesis (HLS) is a powerful tool for developing efficient hardware accelerators that rely on specialized memory systems to achieve sufficient on-chip data reuse and off-chip bandwidth utilization. However, even with HLS, designing such systems still requires careful manual tuning, as automatic optimizations provided by existing tools are highly sensitive to programming style and often lack transparency. To address these issues, we present a formal translation framework based on relational Hoare logic, which enables robust and transparent transformations. Our method recognizes complex memory access patterns in na\"ive HLS programs and automatically transforms them by inserting on-chip buffers to enforce linear access to off-chip memory, and by replacing non-sequential processing with stream processing, while preserving program semantics. Experiments using our prototype translator, combined with an off-the-shelf HLS compiler and a real FPGA board, have demonstrated significant performance improvements.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09217v1</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Energy Storage] Semi-empirical physics-based simulation of time-domain current responses in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and their conversion to frequency-domain spectra</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X25046900?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: 10 March 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of Energy Storage, Volume 150&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Wasinee Pholauyphon, Jirawan Aekchat, Kotchakarn Nantasaksiri, Takahiro Suzuki, Shohji Tsushima, Patcharawat Charoen-amornkitt&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Energy Storage</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 01:01:56 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X25046900</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

In this study, Ce-doped LLZO has been comprehensively analyzed through x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), tunneling electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (TEM-EDS), impedance spectroscopy with distribution of relaxation times, and testing of cell experimentally. XRD confirmed the dominant cubic phase with minor Ce-rich secondary phase, while SEM/TEM-EDS shows dense grains with flaky structure along with the homogeneous distribution of elements.

To be effective, such systems must strongly reflect solar radiation across the solar spectral band while simultaneously exhibiting a high thermal emittance within the atmospheric transparency window. In this work, we investigate the cooling performance of a porous metamaterial composed of air voids embedded in a polydimethylsiloxane matrix. Using a combination of Monte Carlo simulations, which take into account dependent scattering effects, and effective medium theories such as the extended Maxwell–Garnett model and a Nicholson–Ross–Weir-type retrieval method associated with finite-element electromagnetic simulations, we study the influence of void radius and volume fraction on the spectral properties relevant to PDRC. We identify a range of void radii that optimize performance and demonstrate the existence of an optimal radius that maximizes the cooling potential regardless of ambient temperature. These results provide practical design guidelines for the development of efficient PDRC materials and contribute to the broader field of radiative thermal management.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Materials Current Issue</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid

Abstract: When we consider canonical averages for classical discrete systems, typically referred to as substitutional alloys, the map from many-body interatomic interactions to thermodynamic equilibrium configurations generally exhibits complicated nonlinearity. This canonical nonlinearity is fundamentally rooted in deviations of the discrete configurational density of states (CDOS) from continuous Gaussian families, and has conventionally been characterized by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence on discrete statistical manifold. Thus, the previous works inevitablly missed intrinsic nonlinearities induced by discretization of Gaussian families, which remains invisible within conventional information-geometric descriptions. In the present work, we identify and quantify such unavoidable canonical nonlinearity by employing the 2-Wasserstein distance with a cost function aligned with the Fisher metric for Gaussian families. We derive an explicit expression for the Wasserstein distance in the limit of vanishing discretization scale d to 0: W2 = d*sqrt(Tr(Gamma)^(-1)/12), where Gamma denotes covariance matrix of the CDOS. We further show that this limiting Wasserstein distance admits a clear geometric interpretation on the statistical manifold, equivalent to a KL divergence associated with the expected parallel translations of continuous Gaussian. Our framework thus provides a transport-information-geometric characterization of discretization-induced nonlinearity in classical discrete systems, with future potential applications to configurational thermodynamics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08381v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dynamical stability by spin transfer in nearly isotropic magnets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08738</link><description>arXiv:2601.08738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin transfer torques (STTs) control magnetisation by electric currents, enabling a range of nano-scale spintronic applications. They can destabilise the equilibrium magnetisation state by counteracting magnetic relaxation. Here, we maximise the STT effect through a dedicated growth-annealing protocol for CoFeB thin films, such that magnetic anisotropies originating from the interface and shape almost cancel each other. The nearly isotropic magnets enable low-current dynamical stabilisation of the magnetisation in the direction opposite to an applied magnetic field, thereby realising a spintronic analogue of the Kapitza pendulum. In an intermediate current regime, the STT drives large magnetisation vector fluctuations that cover the entire Bloch sphere. The continuous variable associated with the stochastic magnetisation direction may serve as a resource for probabilistic computing and neuromorphic hardware. Our results establish isotropic magnets as a platform to study as-yet-uncharted, far-from-equilibrium spin dynamics including anti-magnonics, with promising implications for unconventional computing paradigms.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08738v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Magnetic ground state of a Jeff = 1/2 based frustrated triangular lattice antiferromagnet</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07194</link><description>arXiv:2504.07194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The subtle interplay between competing degrees of freedom, crystal electric fields, and spin correlations can lead to exotic quantum states in 4f ion-based frustrated triangular lattice antiferromagnets. We present the crystal structure, thermodynamic and muon spin relaxation ({\mu}SR) studies of the 4f ion-based frustrated magnet Ba4YbReWO12, wherein Yb3+ ions constitute a triangular lattice. The magnetic susceptibility does not show any signature of spin freezing down to 1.9 K or long-range magnetic ordering down to 0.4 K. The low-temperature Curie-Weiss fit to the inverse magnetic susceptibility data reveals a weak antiferromagnetic exchange interaction, which is corroborated by the fit of magnetic specific heat data following the J1-J2 model with the nearest neighbor exchange interaction of J1 = -0.197 K between the Jeff = 1/2 states of the Yb3+ moments in the lowest Kramers doublet. The lowest Kramers ground state doublet is well separated from the first excited state with a gap of 278 K, as evidenced by our {\mu}SR experiments that support the realization of Jeff = 1/2 at low temperatures. The specific heat experiments do not detect a phase transition down to 56 mK. The magnetic specific heat shows a broad maximum 90 mK suggesting a disordered ground state with short range spin correlations. The associated magnetic entropy release at low temperatures is consistent with that expected for the Jeff = 1/2 state. The zero-field {\mu}SR measurements show neither the signature of spin freezing nor a phase transition, at least down to 43 mK. Our results suggest a dynamic, disordered ground state in this Jeff = 1/2 frustrated triangular lattice antiferromagnet.

Abstract: For disordered systems within the random first-order transition (RFOT) universality class, such as structural glasses and certain spin glasses, the role played by activated relaxation processes is rich to the point of perplexity. Over the last decades, various efforts have attempted to formalize and systematize such processes in terms of instantons similar to the nucleation droplets of first-order phase transitions. In particular, Kirkpatrick, Thirumalai, and Wolynes proposed in the late '80s an influential nucleation theory of relaxation in structural glasses. Already within this picture, however, the resulting structures are far from the compact objects expected from the classical droplet description. In addition, an altogether different type of single-particle hopping-like instantons has recently been isolated in molecular simulations. Landscape studies of mean-field spin glass models have further revealed that simple saddle crossing does not capture relaxation in these systems. We present here a landscape-agnostic study of rare dynamical events, which delineates the richness of instantons in these systems. Our work not only captures the structure of metastable states, but also identifies the point of irreversibility, beyond which activated relaxation processes become a fait accompli. An interpretation of the associated landscape features is articulated, thus charting a path toward a complete understanding of RFOT instantons.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.00107v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Universal scaling of microwave dissipation in superconducting circuits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08953</link><description>arXiv:2507.08953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Improving the coherence of superconducting qubits is essential for advancing quantum technologies. While superconductors are theoretically perfect conductors, they consistently exhibit residual energy dissipation when driven by microwave currents, limiting coherence times. Here, we report a universal scaling between microwave dissipation and the superfluid density, a bulk property of superconductors related to charge carrier density and disorder. Our analysis spans a wide range of superconducting materials and device geometries, from highly disordered amorphous films to ultra-clean systems with record-high quality factors, including resonators, 3D cavities, and transmon qubits. This scaling reveals an intrinsic bulk dissipation channel, independent of surface dielectric losses, that originates from a universal density of nonequilibrium quasiparticles trapped within disorder-induced spatial variations of the superconducting gap. Our findings identify an empirical coherence limit associated with intrinsic material properties and provide a data-driven basis for materials selection in future superconducting quantum circuits.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.08953v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Optical Detection and Manipulation of Pseudospin Orders in Wigner Crystals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21097</link><description>arXiv:2512.21097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Wigner-crystal states of two-dimensional electrons, the spin ordering remains poorly understood. The small energy differences between candidate spin orders make theoretical studies less reliable, and probing magnetic order at a nonzero wave vector is experimentally challenging. In modern realizations of Wigner crystals, the electronic spin degree of freedom is often replaced by a valley pseudospin associated with nonzero Berry curvature. The resulting anomalous velocity couples the electrons' pseudospin texture to their orbital vibration. We show that this mechanism enables optical detection of pseudospin orders in Wigner crystals by producing sharp signatures in the terahertz optical conductivity. For example, antiferromagnetic pseudospin order enables light to excite collective electronic vibrations at the ordering wave vector, generating a characteristic absorption peak. Based on the same principle, we further show that a strong optical drive generates an effective potential that reshapes the pseudospin energy landscape, inducing phase transitions to stripe antiferromagnetic states. These results point to a route for optical detection and control of spin order via its coupling to orbital motion.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21097v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Universal time-temperature scaling of conductivities in random site energy and associated random barrier model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07731</link><description>arXiv:2601.07731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Universal time-temperature scaling of conductivity spectra in disordered solids has been explained by thermally activated hopping of noninteracting particles over random energy barriers. An open problem is whether the random barrier model accounts for site energy disorder in real materials. Through mapping many-particle hopping in a disordered site energy landscape to that of independent particles in a barrier landscape, we show that time-temperature scaling is correctly described by the associated barrier model in the low temperature limit. However, the site energy model displays good scaling behavior at substantially higher temperatures than the barrier model, in agreement with experimental observations. Extending the mapping to different types of mobile charge carriers allows us to understand why time-temperature superposition can be absent in mixed alkali glasses.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07731v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Stochastic synaptic dynamics under learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13846</link><description>arXiv:2508.13846v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning is based on synaptic plasticity, which affects and is driven by neural activity. Because pre- and postsynaptic spiking activity is shaped by randomness, the synaptic weights follow a stochastic process, requiring a probabilistic framework to capture the noisy synaptic dynamics. We consider a paradigmatic supervised learning example: a presynaptic neural population impinging in a sequence of episodes on a recurrent network of integrate-and-fire neurons through synapses undergoing spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with additive potentiation and multiplicative depression. We first analytically compute the drift- and diffusion coefficients for a single synapse within a single episode (microscopic dynamics), mapping the true jump process to a Langevin and the associated Fokker-Planck equations. Leveraging new analytical tools, we include spike-time--resolving cross-correlations between pre- and postsynaptic spikes, which corrects substantial deviations seen in standard theories purely based on firing rates. We then apply this microdynamical description to the network setup in which hetero-associations are trained over one-shot episodes into a feed-forward matrix of STDP synapses connecting to neurons of the recurrent network (macroscopic dynamics). By mapping statistically distinct synaptic populations to instances of the single-synapse process above, we self-consistently determine the joint neural and synaptic dynamics and, ultimately, the time course of memory degradation and the memory capacity. We demonstrate that specifically in the relevant case of sparse coding, our theory can quantitatively capture memory capacities which are strongly overestimated if spike-time--resolving cross-correlations are ignored.

Abstract: In many cases, the behavior of physical memristive devices can be relatively well captured by using a single internal state variable. This study investigates the low-power control of first-order memristive devices to derive the most energy-efficient protocols for programming their resistances. A unique yet general approach to optimizing the switching transitions in devices of this kind is introduced. For pedagogical purposes, without loss of generality, the proposed control paradigm is applied to a couple of differential algebraic equation sets for voltage-controlled devices, specifically Kvatinsky's Voltage ThrEshold Adaptive Memristor mathematical description and Miranda's and Sune's dynamic balance model. It is demonstrated that, depending upon intrinsic physical properties of the device, captured in the model formulas and parameter setting, and upon constraints on programming time and voltages, the optimal protocol for either of the two switching scenarios may require the application of a single square voltage pulse of height set to a certain level within the admissible range across a fraction or entire given programming time interval, or of some more involved voltage stimulus of unique polarity, including analogue continuous waveforms that can be approximated by trains of square voltage pulses of different heights, over the entire programming time interval. The practical implications of these research findings are significant, as the development of energy-efficient protocols to program memristive devices, resolving the so-called voltage-time dilemma in the device physics community, is a subject under intensive and extensive studies across the academic community and industry.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.15620v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Modeling phononic band gap in microstructured solids using the Riemann-Cartan geometric framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05402</link><description>arXiv:2601.05402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses the modeling of acoustic wave fields in microstructured elastic solids within the framework of Riemann-Cartan geometry. We consider a scenario in which microstructural deformations occur significantly faster than those of the bulk material. This time-scale separation creates apparent geometric incompatibilities at the macroscopic level, even in the absence of permanent inelastic deformation or damage. We formalize this phenomenon by using a non-holonomic frame field to represent macroscopic elastic deformations and an associated torsion field to characterize the resulting geometric incompatibilities. The spatial components of the torsion tensor quantify the instantaneous geometric incompatibility of the macroscopic deformations, while its temporal components capture the inertial effects arising from the reversible energy exchange between the micro- and macro-scales. A key finding is that the model's dispersion relation predicts a complete frequency band gap. Furthermore, the governing equations exhibit a mathematical analogy to Maxwell's equations, potentially bridging the modeling of phononic and photonic metamaterials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05402v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Bio-RV: Low-Power Resource-Efficient RISC-V Processor for Biomedical Applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08428</link><description>arXiv:2601.08428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents Bio-RV, a compact and resource-efficient RISC-V processor intended for biomedical control applications, such as accelerator-based biomedical SoCs and implantable pacemaker systems. The proposed Bio-RV is a multi-cycle RV32I core that provides explicit execution control and external instruction loading with capabilities that enable controlled firmware deployment, ASIC bring-up, and post-silicon testing. In addition to coordinating accelerator configuration and data transmission in heterogeneous systems, Bio-RV is designed to function as a lightweight host controller, handling interfaces with pacing, sensing, electrogram (EGM), telemetry, and battery management modules. With 708 LUTs and 235 flip-flops on FPGA prototypes, Bio-RV, implemented in a 180 nm CMOS technology, operate at 50 MHz and feature a compact hardware footprint. According to post-layout results, the proposed architectural decisions align with minimal energy use.

Here, we demonstrate a mixed-halide strategy to enhance the ionic conductivity of lithium tetrahaloaluminates, LiAlX4 (X = Cl, Br, I). Twenty compositions, including single-, binary-, and ternary-halide systems, were synthesized via a mechanochemical route. Their ionic conductivities were evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, while the local environments of Li and Al were investigated using solid-state NMR in combination with powder X-ray diffraction (XRD).  A conductivity map was constructed from the experimental data using a ternary diagram. The highest conductivity is observed near the center of the Cl-Br-I compositional triangle, where the configurational entropy is maximized. XRD patterns indicate that both binary and ternary mixed-halide samples retain the overall framework structure. 27Al magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR reveals multiple X combinations of AlX4- units in the binary and ternary systems, consistent with random anion mixing. 7Li MAS NMR spectra exhibit motional narrowing that correlates with enhanced ionic conductivity, particularly in the ternary compositions.  The activation energy and pre-exponential factor extracted from Arrhenius plots of the conductivity follow the Meyer-Neldel rule. These results suggest that the Li+ migration barrier can be overcome through the annihilation of multi-phonon excitation modes. The enhanced ionic conductivity achieved via increased compositional complexity highlights the potential of entropy-driven design strategies for next-generation solid-state batteries.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-sxpz5?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Abstract: Phase transitions are omnipresent in modern condensed matter physics and its applications. In solids, phase transformations typically occur by nucleation and growth under non-equilibrium conditions. Under constant external conditions, $\textit{e.g.}$, constant heating temperature and pressure, the nucleation and growth dynamics are often thought of as spatially and temporally independent. Here, $\textit{in-situ}$ Bragg X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) reveals nanoscale spatial and dynamical heterogeneity in the perovskite to brownmillerite topotactic phase transformation in La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$CoO$_3$ (LSCO) thin films under constant reducing conditions over a time-span of multiple hours. Specifically, a timescale associated with domain growth remains stable, with a corresponding domain wall speed of $v_d = 6 \pm 0.5 \times10^{-4}$ nm/s ($2 \pm 0.2$ nm/h), while a slower timescale, associated with temperature driven de-pinning of domains, leads to accelerating dynamics with timescales following an aging power law with exponent $-2.2 \pm 0.5$. The experiment demonstrates that Bragg XPCS is a powerful tool to study nanoscale dynamics in phase transformations. The results are relevant for phase engineering of phase-change devices, as they show that nanoscale dynamics, linked to domain and domain-wall motion, can continuously evolve and speed up with time, even hours after the initiation of the phase transformation, with potential repercussions on electrical performance.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06365v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Two-Level System Microwave Losses in Chemically Pure Bulk Niobium Oxide Samples</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06668</link><description>arXiv:2601.06668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Losses from two-level systems (TLS) associated with amorphous oxides remain one of the primary limitations to the performance of superconducting resonators in quantum information science and precision measurements. Niobium resonators are widely used for these purposes, yet niobium's natural oxide stack contains various types of oxides whose relative contributions to TLS loss have not been clearly distinguished. Here, we use a superconducting 3D microwave cavity to measure chemically pure oxides \ch{Nb2O5} and \ch{NbO2}. Using this approach, we directly compare the loss characteristics of \ch{Nb2O5} and \ch{NbO2}. Our measurements show that the \ch{Nb2O5} oxide exhibits TLS-like power and temperature dependence. Analogous measurements performed on \ch{NbO2} do not show any detectable TLS loss signatures. These results provide direct experimental evidence that \ch{Nb2O5} is the dominant TLS host in niobium resonators and establish a general framework for separating oxide-specific dissipation channels</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06668v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A phase field model of the effects of dislocation microstructure on grain boundary motion during recrystallization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06669</link><description>arXiv:2601.06669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The internal energy associated with the defect microstructure of strongly deformed crystals provides an important driving force for grain boundary motion during recrystallization. Typical dislocation microstructures are strongly heterogeneous and this heterogeneity affects the motion of recrystallization boundaries. In this study, a phase field model for microstructure evolution encompassing the evolution of both dislocation densities and grain order parameters is formulated. The model is employed to generate typical dislocation microstructures exhibiting multiscale features such as incidental and geometrically necessary dislocation walls. It is then used to study the motion of recrystallization boundaries in the associated complex defect energy 'landscape'. Results are compared to experimental observations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06669v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] In-context learning emerges in chemical reaction networks without attention</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06712</link><description>arXiv:2601.06712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether chemical processes can perform in-context learning (ICL), a mode of computation typically associated with transformer architectures. ICL allows a system to infer task-specific rules from a sequence of examples without relying solely on fixed parameters. Traditional ICL relies on a pairwise attention mechanism which is not obviously implementable in chemical systems. However, we show theoretically and numerically that chemical processes can achieve ICL through a mechanism we call subspace projection, in which the entire input vector is mapped onto comparison subspaces, with the dominant projection determining the computational output. We illustrate this mechanism analytically in small chemical systems and show numerically that performance is robust to input encoding and dynamical choices, with the number of tunable degrees of freedom in the input encoding as a key limitation. Our results provide a blueprint for realizing ICL in chemical or other physical media and suggest new directions for designing adaptive synthetic chemical systems and understanding possible biological computation in cells.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06712v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Self-oscillations induced by self-induced torque in magnetic double tunnel junction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07300</link><description>arXiv:2601.07300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-oscillations of the magnetization due to self-induced torque (SIT) in a magnetic double tunnel junction that consists of perpendicularly polarized, pinned and free layers is investigated along with the field-like torque (FLT). The associated Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski equation is numerically analysed to exhibit the oscillations of magnetization driven by the current. From the numerical analysis, we show that the SIT is essential to generate os- cillations in the order of GHz and without it the magnetization reaches steady state after exhibiting switching. Without FLT, the frequency of the oscilla- tions decreases with the current while the power of oscillations increases. In the presence of the negative strength of the FLT the power spectral density confirms that the frequency, power and the Q-factor increase with the current. Also the tunability range and the rate at which the frequency enhances increase with the magnitude of the FLT.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07300v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Sliding Charge Density Wave observed through Band Structure</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07417</link><description>arXiv:2601.07417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An incommensurate CDW may have the ability to slide, i.e., to generate an excess of current when the system is submitted to an external field. Sliding phenomenon is closely related to deformation of the periodic lattice distortion associated to the CDW. In principle, however, the sliding state can also be observed through the band structure. Here we show that broken symmetry in k-space is observed by Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) in the sliding regime of TbTe$_3$, which could be consistent with theoretical predictions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07417v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Learning About Learning: A Physics Path from Spin Glasses to Artificial Intelligence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07635</link><description>arXiv:2601.07635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hopfield model, originally inspired by spin-glass physics, occupies a central place at the intersection of statistical mechanics, neural networks, and modern artificial intelligence. Despite its conceptual simplicity and broad applicability -- from associative memory to near-optimal solutions of combinatorial optimization problems -- it is rarely integrated into standard undergraduate physics curricula. In this paper, we present the Hopfield model as a pedagogically rich framework that naturally unifies core topics from undergraduate statistical physics, dynamical systems, linear algebra, and computational methods. We provide a concise and illustrated theoretical introduction grounded in familiar physics concepts, analyze the model's energy function, dynamics, and pattern stability, and discuss practical aspects of simulation, including a freely available simulation code. To support instruction, we conclude with classroom-ready example problems designed to mirror research practice. By explicitly connecting fundamental physics to contemporary AI applications, this work aims to help prepare physics students to understand, apply, and critically engage with the computational tools increasingly central to research, industry, and society.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07635v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Universal time-temperature scaling of conductivities in random site energy and associated random barrier model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07731</link><description>arXiv:2601.07731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal time-temperature scaling of conductivity spectra in disordered solids has been explained by thermally activated hopping of noninteracting particles over random energy barriers. An open problem is whether the random barrier model accounts for site energy disorder in real materials. Through mapping many-particle hopping in a disordered site energy landscape to that of independent particles in a barrier landscape, we show that time-temperature scaling is correctly described by the associated barrier model in the low temperature limit. However, the site energy model displays good scaling behavior at substantially higher temperatures than the barrier model, in agreement with experimental observations. Extending the mapping to different types of mobile charge carriers allows us to understand why time-temperature superposition can be absent in mixed alkali glasses.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07731v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Serial vs parallel recall in the Blume-Every-Griffiths neural networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07777</link><description>arXiv:2601.07777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully connected Blume-Emery-Griffiths neural networks performing pattern recognition and associative memory have been heuristically studied in the past (mainly via the replica trick and under the replica symmetric assumption) as generalization of the standard Hopfield reference. In these notes, at first, by relying upon Guerra interpolation, we re-obtain the existing picture rigorously. Next we show that, due to dilution in the patterns, these networks are able to switch from serial recall (where one pattern is retrieved per time) to parallel recall (where several patterns are retrieved at once) and the larger the dilution, the stronger this emerging multi-tasking capability. In particular, we inspect the regimes of mild dilution (where solely a low storage of pattern can be enabled) and extreme dilution (where a medium storage of patterns can be sustained) separately as they give rise to different outcomes: the former displays hierarchical recall (distributing the amplitudes of the retrieved signals with different amplitudes), the latter -instead- performs a equal-strength recall (where a O(1) fraction of all the patterns is simultaneously retrieved with the same amplitude per pattern). Finally, in order to implement graded responses in the neurons, variations on theme obtained by enlarging the possible values of neural activity these neurons may sustain are also discussed generalizing the Ghatak-Sherrington model for inverse freezing in Hebbian terms.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07777v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Ising Supercriticality and Universal Magnetocalorics in Spiral Antiferromagnet Nd$_3$BWO$_9$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07810</link><description>arXiv:2601.07810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated analogy between the pressure-temperature phase diagram of a liquid-gas system and the field-temperature phase diagram of an Ising ferromagnet has long been a cornerstone for understanding universality in critical phenomena. Here we extend this analogy to a highly frustrated antiferromagnet, the kagome-layered spiral Ising compound Nd$_3$BWO$_9$. In its field-temperature phase diagram, we identify a critical endpoint (CEP) and an associated Ising supercritical regime (ISR). The CEP of the metamagnetic transition is located at ${\mu_0H_c} \simeq 1.04$ T and $T_c \simeq 0.3$ K. Above this point, the ISR emerges with supercritical crossover lines that adhere to a universal scaling law, as evidenced by the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Remarkably, we observe a universally divergent Grueneisen ratio near the emergent CEP, $\Gamma_H \propto 1/t^{\beta+\gamma-1}$, with ${\beta} + {\gamma} \simeq 1.563$ the critical exponents of the 3D Ising universality class and $t \equiv (T - T_c)/T_c$ the reduced temperature. Our adiabatic demagnetization measurements on Nd$_3$BWO$_9$ reveal a lowest temperature of 195 mK achieved from 2 K and 4 T. Our work opens new avenues for studying supercritical physics and efficient cooling in layered-kagome, rare-earth RE$_3$BWO$_9$ family and, more broadly, in Ising-anisotropic magnets like spin ices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07810v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Energetic vs Inference-Based Invisibility: Fisher-Information Analysis of Two-Layer Acoustic Near-Cloaks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06091</link><description>arXiv:2601.06091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near-cloaks based on passive coatings can strongly suppress scattered-field energy in a narrow frequency band, yet an observer's ability to infer object parameters from noisy measurements need not decrease proportionally. We develop a fully theoretical two-dimensional (2D) framework for a coated acoustic cylinder in an air background. Using an exact cylindrical-harmonic solution of the Helmholtz equation, we compute the modal scattering coefficients a_m(omega) for a core of radius a surrounded by two concentric effective-fluid layers, and we design the coating to cancel the dominant low-order multipoles (monopole m=0 and dipole m=+/-1) at a target frequency, yielding a narrowband near-cloak. Beyond the conventional energetic metric (total scattering width), we quantify information-based detectability through the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and the associated Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for joint estimation of the size-material parameter vector x=[a, rho1, c1]^T from noisy far-field data. A representative air-background study exhibits an approximately 25 dB reduction in total scattering width near the design frequency, while tr(FIM) decreases by only a few dB, demonstrating that energy-based and inference-based notions of invisibility are distinct objectives. We further provide a low-order analytic argument clarifying the mechanism behind this energetic-informational decoupling and report design-space and local-robustness diagnostics that highlight persistent trade-offs between scattering suppression and parameter identifiability.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06091v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Imaginary Gauge-steerable Edge Modes In Non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06746</link><description>arXiv:2601.06746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper lattice exhibiting quasiperiodicity, featuring an imaginary gauge field that varies spatially but averages to zero. In the presence of open boundary conditions, this system is precisely mapped, through a nonunitary gauge transformation, to the Hermitian AAH model with balanced hopping terms. The mapping leaves the spectrum unchanged but reshapes each eigenfunction by a realization-dependent random-walk envelope. In a parameter regime where the Hermitian counterpart hosts spectrally isolated in-gap boundary modes, we identify two such modes with sharply different responses to the envelope: one stays anchored at the boundary, while the other is controllable via the gauge, allowing its peak intensity to be relocated solely by altering the gauge setup without modifying the associated eigenenergy. Additionally, we demonstrate that this steerable mode can be preferentially enhanced and generated from an initial bulk wavefunction by introducing mild site-specific amplification at a location determined exclusively from the Hermitian model using the biorthogonal function. These findings offer pathways for both static and dynamic manipulation of spatially adjustable in-gap states in quasiperiodic non-Hermitian lattices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06746v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] BEC with two ground-state filling rates for BCS Cooper-pairs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11447</link><description>arXiv:2311.11447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the effects on the thermodynamic properties of a 3D Bose gas caused by a temperature dependent energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state of the energy spectrum of the particles constituting the Bose gas which behaves like an ideal Bose gas when the gap is absent but whose properties are very different when it is present. Explicit formulae are given for the critical temperature, the condensate fraction, the internal energy and the isochoric specific heat, which are calculated for three different gaps which abruptly go to zero at a temperature $T_B$, as well as for the damped counterparts with a smoothed drop to zero. In particular, for the undamped BCS (Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer) gap it is observed that the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) critical temperature $T_c$ is equal to that of the ideal Bose gas $T_0$, for every $T_B \leq T_0$; surprisingly, the condensate fraction presents two different filling rates of the ground state, one at $T_c = T_0$ and another with a higher rate at $T_B &lt; T_0$, suggesting something like a {\it two-step} BEC; also, its specific heat shows a finite jump at $T_c$ and a divergence at $T_B$ with a critical exponent $\alpha=1/2$, which is inherited from the divergence of the temperature derivative of the BCS gap at $T_B$.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2311.11447v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Demonstrating Electrochemical CO$_2$ Capture on Redox-Active Metal-Organic Frameworks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16444</link><description>arXiv:2411.16444v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Addressing climate change calls for action to control CO$_2$ pollution. Direct air and ocean capture offer a solution to this challenge. Making carbon capture competitive with alternatives, such as forestation and mineralisation, requires fundamentally novel approaches and ideas. One such approach is electrosorption, which is currently limited by the availability of suitable electrosorbents. In this work, we introduce a metal-organic copper-2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene (Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$) metal-organic framework (MOF) that can act as electrosorbent for CO$_2$ capture, thereby expanding the palette of materials that can be used for this process. Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$ is the first MOF to switch its ability to capture and release CO$_2$ in aqueous electrolytes. By using cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) analysis, and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), we demonstrate reversible CO$_2$ electrosorption. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we provide atomistic insights into the mechanism of electrosorption and conclude that efficient CO$_2$ capture is facilitated by a combination of redox-active copper atom and aromatic HHTP ligand within Cu3(HHTP)2. By showcasing the applicability of Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$ -- with a CO$_2$ capacity of 2 mmol g$^{-1}$ and an adsorption enthalpy of -20 kJ mol$^{-1}$ - this study encourages further exploration of conductive redox-active MOFs in the search for superior CO$_2$ electrosorbents.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.16444v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Frustration-free free fermions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14312</link><description>arXiv:2503.14312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of frustration-free free-fermion systems and derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for such Hamiltonians. Assuming locality and translation invariance, we find that any band touching between the valence and the conduction bands is always quadratic or softer, which rules out the possibility of describing Dirac and Weyl semimetals using frustration-free local Hamiltonians. We further construct a frustration-free free-fermion model on the honeycomb lattice and show that its density fluctuations acquire an anomalous gap originating from the diverging quantum metric associated with the quadratic band-touching points. Nevertheless, an $O(1/L^2)$ finite-size scaling of the charge-neutral excitation gap can be verified even in the presence of interactions, consistent with the more general results we derive in an accompanying work [arXiv:2503.12879].</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.14312v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spin ladder quantum simulators from spin-orbit-coupled quantum dot spin qubits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08358</link><description>arXiv:2508.08358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent Ge hole spin qubit experiments, we construct and study a two-leg spin ladder from a quantum dot array with spin-orbit couplings (SOCs), aiming to uncover the many-body phase diagrams and provide concrete guidance for the Ge hole spin qubit experiments. The spin ladder is described by an unprecedented, complex spin Hamiltonian, which contains antiferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM), and anisotropic exchange interactions. We analyze the spin ladder Hamiltonian in two complementary situations, the strong rung coupling limit and the weak rung coupling limit. In the strong rung coupling limit, we systematically construct effective spin-1/2 chain models, connecting the well-studied one-dimensional spin models and providing a recipe for Hamiltonian engineering. It is worth emphasizing that effective DM interactions can be completely turned off while the microscopic DM interactions are generically inevitable. Moreover, the staggered DM interactions, which are not possible in the microscopic spin model, can also be realized in the effective spin-1/2 model. In the weak rung coupling limit, we employ Abelian bosonization and Luther-Emery fermionization, uncovering a multitude of phases. Several commensurate-incommensurate transitions are driven by both the longitudinal magnetic field and the DM interactions in the legs (chains). Remarkably, the low-energy phase diagrams show strong dependence in the DM interaction, providing a concrete way to identify the strength of SOC in the experiments. Our work bridges quantum many-body theory and spin qubit device physics, establishing spin ladders made of spin-orbit-coupled quantum dots as a promising platform for engineering exotic spin models, constructing quantum many-body states, and enabling programmable quantum computations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.08358v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Fermi sea topology and boundary geometry for free particles in one- and two-dimensional lattices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00590</link><description>arXiv:2509.00590v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Free gasses of spinless fermions moving on a lattice-symmetric geometric background are considered. Their topological properties at zero temperature can be used to classify their Fermi seas and associated boundaries. The flat orbifolds ${\Rb}^{d}/\Gamma$, where $\Gamma$ is the crystallographic group of symmetry in $d$-dimensional momentum space, are used to accomplish this task. Two topological classes exist for $d=1$: an interval, which is identified as a conductor, and a circumference, which corresponds to an insulator. The number of topological classes increases to 17 for $d=2$: 8 have the topology of a disk, that are generally recognized as conductors, and 4 correspond to a 2-sphere, matching insulators. Both sets eventually contain a finite number of conical singularities and reflection corners at the boundaries. The remaining cases in the listing relate to conductors (annulus, M\"obius strip) and insulators (2-torus, real projective plane, Klein bottle). Examples that fall under this list are given, along with physical interpretations of the singularities. It is anticipated that the findings of this classification will be robust under perturbative interactions due to its topological character.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.00590v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum Mechanics of an Abrikosov Vortex in Nanofabricated Pinning Potential</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12215</link><description>arXiv:2509.12215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A superconducting device is proposed for experimentally investigating whether an Abrikosov vortex can be modeled as a quantum mechanical quasiparticle. The design process of a type-II superconducting device capable of reliably pinning a single Abrikosov vortex is presented, creating a particle-in-a-box-like system. The proposed device consists of a cylindrically symmetric Nb film, 30 nm in diameter and 5 nm thick, with a 14 nm diameter artificial pinning center at its center. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations indicate robust single-vortex pinning under an applied field of 6 T. The presumed quantized energy levels and associated quantum wavefunctions of the vortex quasiparticle are obtained by numerically solving the two-dimensional time-independent Schr\"odinger equation for this system. It is shown that distinguishing the ground and first excited states is experimentally feasible. Beyond fundamental physics studies, the application of the proposed device in cryogenic memory technology and quantum computing warrant further exploration.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.12215v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum sensing of time-dependent magnetic signals with molecular spins</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17144</link><description>arXiv:2509.17144v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular spins offer a promising platform for quantum sensing, particularly in organic, supramolecular or biological environments. Recognition of the signals by these systems is of particular interest given their possible integration into more complex structures and their possible use as sensors in close proximity to analytes. In this work, we develop two quantum sensing protocols that enable discrimination between different time-dependent magnetic field, without requiring its periodicity to match with the microwave manipulating sequence. These are based on the Hahn echo sequence and have been tested on VO(TPP) and VOPt(SOCPh$)_{4}$ molecular spins embedded in a superconducting YBCO microwave planar resonator. We report a magnetic field sensitivity up to $2.57 \cdot 10^{-7} T Hz^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ (with lower bounds approaching $2.87 \cdot 10^{-8} T Hz^{-\frac{1}{2}})$ for signals with duration of a few microseconds. Under the given conditions, the minimum signal area that can be measured is in the $10^{-10}$ T s range, suggesting a potential trade-off between minimum measurable field and the required signal duration and memory time.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.17144v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Chirality reversal at finite magnetic impurity strength and local signatures of a topological phase transition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11707</link><description>arXiv:2510.11707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the honeycomb lattice with a single magnetic impurity modeled by adding imaginary next-nearest-neighbor hopping ih on a single hexagon. This Haldane defect gives a topological mass term to the gapless Dirac cones and generates chirality. For a small density of defects Neehus et al [arXiv:2405.19289] found that the system's chirality reverses at a critical hc ~ 0.95 associated with an unexpected tri-critical point of Dirac fermions at zero defect density. We investigate this zero-density limit by analyzing a single defect and computing two experimentally relevant measures of chirality: (1) orbital magnetization via local Chern marker, a bulk probe of all occupied states; and (2) electronic currents of low-energy states. Both probes show a chirality reversal at a critical hc ~ 0.9--1. Motivated by this consistency we propose a defect-scale toy model whose low energy states reverse their chirality at hc' ~ 0.87. Remarkably, the same pair of zero energy bound states also generate the critical point hc in the full impurity projected T-matrix. Our results show how the chirality reversal produced by an impurity can be observed either in local probes or in the global topology and suggest a possible role of the microscopic defect structure at the critical point.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.11707v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Effective-Hamiltonian reconstruction through Bloch-wave interferometry in bulk GaAs driven by strong THz fields</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26028</link><description>arXiv:2510.26028v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective Hamiltonians (EHs) are powerful tools for understanding the emergent phenomena in condensed matter. Reconstructing an EH directly from experimental data is challenging due to the intricate relationship between EH parameters and observables. Complementary to ARPES, which probes surface electronic properties, bulk-sensitive techniques based on HHG and HSG have shown strong potential for EH reconstruction (EHR). We reconstruct an effective three-band electron-hole (e-h) Hamiltonian in bulk GaAs based on HSG induced by quasi-cw NIR and THz lasers. We perform polarimetry of high-order sidebands while varying the wavelength and polarization of the NIR laser and the strength of the THz field, to systematically explore the information encoded in the sidebands. Based on previous understanding of HSG in GaAs in terms of Bloch-wave interferometry (BWI), an analytic model is derived to quantitatively connect the EH parameters with the measured sideband electric fields under strong, low-frequency THz fields. Assuming that the exciton reduced mass and the parameter that defines the hole Bloch wavefunctions in GaAs are known from existing experiments, we show that the GaAs bandgap, two dephasing constants associated with two e-h species, and an EH parameter that determines the e-h reduced masses, can be simultaneously and unambiguously determined through BWI. We demonstrate that full EHR can be achieved by combining HSG measurements with absorbance spectroscopy. We find that the extracted bandgap of GaAs is about 10\,meV higher than the value inferred from previous absorbance measurements. Quantum-kinetic analysis suggests that the e-h energy in HSG may be renormalized through Fr\"ohlich interaction that is modified by a strong THz field. We show that the energy threshold for optical-phonon emission can be suppressed by applying a strong THz field, leading to nearly constant dephasing rates.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.26028v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Symmetry and Topology in the Non-Hermitian Kitaev chain</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00951</link><description>arXiv:2601.00951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain with non-reciprocal hopping amplitudes and asymmetric superconducting pairing. We work out the symmetry structure of the model and show that particle-hole symmetry (PHS) is preserved throughout the entire parameter regime. As a consequence of PHS, the topological phase transition point of a finite open chain coincides with that of the periodic (infinite) system. By explicitly constructing the zero-energy wave functions (Majorana modes), we show that Majorana modes necessarily occur as reciprocal localization pairs accumulating on opposite boundaries, whose combined probability density exhibits an exact cancellation of the non-Hermitian skin effect for the zero energy modes. Excited states, by contrast, generically display skin-effect localization, with particle and hole components accumulating at opposite ends of the system. At the level of bulk topology, we further construct a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant in restricted parameter regimes that correctly distinguishes the topological and trivial phases. Finally, we present the topological phase diagram of the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain across a broad range of complex parameters and delineate the associated phase boundaries.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00951v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The Lee-Wick-Chern-Simons pseudo-quantum electrodynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15444</link><description>arXiv:2504.15444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lee-Wick pseudo-quantum electrodynamics in the presence of a Chern-Simons term is studied in this paper. The paper starts with a non-local lagrangian density that sets the pseudo-Lee-Wick electrodynamics defined on a $1+2$ space-time added to a non-local Chern-Simons topological term. Thus, we obtain the Lee-Wick-Chern-Simons pseudo-electrodynamics as a most complete gauge invariant model that provides a light mass associated with the Chern-Simons parameter, and also includes a Lee-Wick heavy mass. We investigate classical aspects as the potential energy for the interaction of static charges through the gauge propagator. The causality of theory is discussed through the retarded Green function in the coordinate space. The gauge field of the Lee-Wick-Chern-Simons pseudo-electrodynamics is minimally coupled to the fermions sector that includes new degree of freedoms, as a Lee-Wick heavy fermion partner of the electron. The perturbative approach for the theory is presented via effective action in which we obtain the Ward identities. We study the quantum corrections at one loop, as the electron self-energy, the vacuum polarization, and the $3$-vertex. We show that the Lee-Wick mass has a fundamental role in these results, where it works like a natural regulator of the ultraviolet divergences. The $g-2$ factor for the electron is obtained as function of the LW mass, and of the CS parameter. Through the optical theorem, the Lee-Wick-Chern-Simons pseudo-electrodynamics is unitary at the tree level.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.15444v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A Generalized Crystalline Equivalence Principle</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10978</link><description>arXiv:2508.10978v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a general version of the crystalline equivalence principle which gives an equivalence of categories between a category of TQFTs defined on a generic space with $G$-symmetry, and a category of TQFTs with internal symmetry. We give a definition and classification of anomalies associated to TQFTs in the presence of spatial symmetry, which we then generalize to a definition of an anomaly for a categorical symmetry.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.10978v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The Photochemical Birth of the Hydrated Electron in Liquid Water</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19702</link><description>arXiv:2508.19702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The photophysics and photochemistry associated with irradiating UV light in liquid water is central to numerous physical, chemical and biological processes. One of the key events involved in this process is the generation of the hydrated electron. Despite long study from both experimental and theoretical fronts, a unified understanding of the underlying mechanisms associated with the generation of the solvated electron have remained elusive. Here, using excited-state molecular dynamics simulations of condensed phase photoexcited liquid water, we unravel the key sequence of chemical events leading to the creation of the hydrated electron on the excited state. The process begins through the excitation localized mostly on specific topological defects in the hydrogen-bond network of water which is subsequently followed by two main reaction pathways. The first, leads to the creation of a hydrogen atom culminating in non-radiative decay back to the ground-state within 100 femtoseconds. The second involves a proton coupled electron transfer, giving rise to the formation of the hydronium ion, hydroxyl radical and the hydrated excess electron on the excited-state. This process is facilitated by ultrafast coupled rotational and translational motions of water molecules leading to the formation of water mediated ion-radical pairs in the network. These species can survive on the picosecond timescale and ultimately modulate the emission of visible photons. All in all, our findings provide fresh perspectives into the interpretation of several independent time-dependent spectroscopies measured over the last decades, paving the way for new directions on both theoretical and experimental fronts.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.19702v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Enabling Long FFT Convolutions on Memory-Constrained FPGAs via Chunking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06065</link><description>arXiv:2601.06065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The need for long-context reasoning has led to alternative neural network architectures besides Transformers and self-attention, a popular model being Hyena, which employs causal 1D-convolutions implemented with FFTs. Long convolutions enable efficient global context mixing, but requirements for intermediate results exceed the 2-3 MB Block RAM capacity of FPGAs. We present a chunked FFT convolution approach enabling 450K length sequence by 450K length filter convolutions on an Alveo U200 FPGA with 2.8 MB BRAM through chunking and overlap-add reconstruction. We find that throughput scales proportionally with chunk size while degrading minimally by 7% for our longest sequences, demonstrating that careful memory management enables deployment of long-context primitives on edge FPGAs without sacrificing performance.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06065v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Timing Fragility Aware Selective Hardening of RISCV Soft Processors on SRAM Based FPGAs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06308</link><description>arXiv:2601.06308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Selective hardening is widely employed to improve the reliability of FPGA based soft processors while limiting the overhead of full redundancy. However, existing approaches primarily rely on architectural criticality or functional fault analysis, overlooking the impact of routing dependent timing sensitivity on processor robustness. This paper introduces a timing fragility aware selective hardening methodology for RISCV soft processors implemented on SRAM based FPGAs. Building on recent advances in in situ timing observability, the proposed approach quantifies the statistical timing sensitivity of pipeline components under controlled routing perturbations and uses this information to guide hardening decisions. Experimental results on a RISCV processor implemented on a commercial FPGA platform show that components exhibiting higher timing fragility also demonstrate increased vulnerability to routing induced delay effects. Leveraging this correlation, the proposed selective hardening strategy achieves robustness comparable to full hardening while significantly reducing area and timing overhead. These results demonstrate that timing fragility provides a practical and effective metric for reliability aware design optimization in FPGA based processor architectures.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06308v1</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Quantum Chemical Insight into Electrochemical Upgrading of Bio-oil</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-02lvv?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Bio-oil derived from lignocellulosic biomass represents a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels as an energy source and chemical feedstock. Fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass yields a rich mixture of oxygenated organic species with low energy density and low stability, which can be electrochemically upgraded to increase energy density and stability and produce value-added chemicals. Here, we focus on electrocatalytic hydrotreatment of furfural (FF) and 4-propylphenol (4-PP), two constituents of raw bio-oil. In a binary mixture, the presence of FF has been shown to inhibit the reduction of 4-PP. The underlying mechanisms of these competing reactions are probed using density functional theory (DFT) and experimental electrochemical deposition techniques. The binding energies of FF and 4-PP, as well as their respective reduction products and associated reaction thermodynamics, are examined comparatively on multiple facets of single-crystal platinum and ruthenium catalysts. FF is shown to bind competitively compared to 4-PP, particularly on Pt(111) and Ru(0001), and hydrogenation products such as tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) and 4-propylcyclohexanol (4-PCOL) were found to bind less strongly to the surfaces than the reactants. FF reduction side products, including dimers furoin (FUI) and hydrofuroin (HF), were also found to bind competitively with 4-PP. No thermodynamic barriers were observed for FF hydrogenation to THFA, whereas 4-PCOL formation is favored on Pt facets, and propylcyclohexane (PC) formation is favored on Ru. The presence of barriers to 4-PP hydrogenation indicates that FF hydrogenation is thermodynamically favored on Pt and Ru. Further, limiting potential calculations suggests that the FF reduction pathways are generally favorable around 0 V vs. RHE. In contrast, the 4-PP reduction pathways require a more cathodic bias, achieved at potentials less than -0.1 V vs. RHE. Adsorption behavior of FF-derived reduction products on polycrystalline Pt is experimentally validated using a Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM). Such experiments yield estimates of aqueous-phase free energies of adsorption, which are correlated with the gas phase for comparison with computational results. Overall, the DFT model results suggest that the observed inhibition of 4-PP by FF is due to competitive adsorption and favorable FF reaction thermodynamics.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-02lvv?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Spectroscopy and dynamics of the v = 1 levels derived from the OH(D) stretching modes in the I‾∙HDO complex using CW and time-resolved, resonant two-photon infrared excitation of the cryogenically cooled ions</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-61x07?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The vibrational energy levels of the two isotopomers adopted by the I‾∙HDO ion-molecule complex occur such that the OH(D) stretching fundamentals span its dissociation energy, thus enabling a spectroscopic investigation of the dynamics displayed by a system prepared in the vicinity of the dissociation threshold. This regime is explored using infrared photoexcitation of the mass-selected complexes cooled in a cryogenic radiofrequency (Paul) ion trap. Survey spectra are obtained at modest resolution using two-color, IR-IR photodissociation with nanosecond lasers to establish the level structure and unimolecular decay dynamics of the v = 1 and 2 levels of the bound OH(D) oscillator. The v = 1 levels are prepared by fixed frequency excitation in the trap and the absorption spectra arising from this excited state are probed by photofragmentation of the complex with a second pulsed IR laser after a variable delay time (0 to 20 ms). The transitions to levels above the dissociation threshold for I‾ + HDO formation are observed to be sharp (~5 cm-1 FWHM). At low pressure, the bound OD (v = 1) population relaxes very slowly (3 ms), consistent with resonant fluorescence in the IR. The collisional quenching rate constants of this level by the He buffer gas were estimated to be on the order 3 x 10-12 cm3/sec based on a crude Stern-Volmer analysis. The rotational fine structure and linewidths (~&lt;0.01 cm-1 FWHM) arising from transitions of the non-bonded OH stretch fundamental of the OD-bound isotopomer that lies just above the dissociation energy are determined using single photon photodissociation by excitation of the 10 K ions with a single-frequency, CW IR laser in the ion trap.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-61x07?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

The challenge is compounded by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), a strain resistant to first-line antibiotics, which is associated with a 64% higher mortality rate compared to susceptible strains. Current methods for accurately identifying and localizing occult infections are limited, and there is a critical lack of effective novel treatments for infections that fail to respond to antibiotics. To address this, we pioneered the development of an antimicrobial peptide (AMP)-based radiotheranostic pair for the imaging-guided treatment of S. aureus and MRSA infections. We first screened a library of renowned AMPs for their efficacy against (MR)SA and their suitability for non-invasive, whole-body PET imaging after radiolabeling with Gallium-68. The optimal candidate, [68Ga]QAMP3, demonstrated excellent performance, readily and specifically accumulating in both S. aureus and MRSA infection sites, but not in sterile inflammation or tumors. A pilot first-in-human study confirmed the translatable diagnostic potential and favorable biosafety profile of [68Ga]QAMP3. Furthermore, the corresponding therapeutic agent, [177Lu]QAMP3, effectively reduced bacterial load in rat models of septic arthritis caused by both S. aureus and MRSA following a single systemic administration. Treatment resulted in the complete restoration of joint morphology, comparable to healthy controls. Simultaneously, [68Ga]QAMP3 PET/CT imaging accurately monitored the therapeutic response to both [177Lu]QAMP3 and conventional antibiotic treatment. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the stable α-helical conformation of QAMP3 likely confers superior membrane permeability and subsequent internalization into bacterial cells, leading to lethal DNA damage. These findings position [68Ga]/[177Lu]QAMP3 as an innovative theranostic pair for the rapid diagnosis and effective treatment of MRSA infections. This study also paves the way for developing new radio-antibiotics with mechanisms of action that can circumvent conventional antibiotic resistance.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-phkc6?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Enhanced Photodisplacement of Perylene Bisimides via Multi-Electron Extraction from CdSe Nanoplatelets</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-wk8lx?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Ligand exchange is an elegant route to tailor semiconducting nanocrystal surfaces, yet it is constrained by ground-state thermodynamics, and thus access is limited to the most stable interfacial structures. Light-driven ligand desorption, by contrast, offers a non-equilibrium handle to dynamically reconfigure surfaces and potentially reach thermodynamically inaccessible states. Here we study photoinduced displacement of perylene bisimide (PBI) ligands from 5-ML (monolayer) CdSe nanoplatelets (NPLs). Upon NPL excitation, the displacement efficiency is enhanced by up to 7 times compared with zero dimensional nanocrystals and can be tuned by NPL lateral dimensions and PBI surface loading. Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals 100-ps electron transfer from the NPL band edge to the PBI LUMO that initiates ligand dissociation. The overall yield is ultimately limited by the probability that a PBI ligand lies within the exciton diffusion range, set by vacant [100] basal-plane binding sites. These results establish nanoplatelets as efficient light-programmable platforms for dynamic ligand chemistry beyond thermodynamic control.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-wk8lx?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Visible-Light-Driven Ruthenium-Catalyzed Hydrogenation of Man-ganese-Nitride Complexes to Ammonia under Ambient Conditions</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-bdhgx?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>In recent years, photocatalytic hydrogenation of metal-nitrides to ammonia using solar energy as a renewable energy source and dihydrogen as both an electron and a proton source has been intensively investigated to achieve one of the most desirable next-generation scientific techniques, i.e., atom-economical ammonia production from dinitrogen and dihydrogen, thereby contributing to a carbon-neutral society. In this study, we have successfully developed visi-ble-light-driven photocatalytic hydrogenation of manganese-nitride complexes to ammonia at room temperature un-der 1 atm of dihydrogen in the presence of diruthenium complexes as dihydrogen oxidation catalysts and iridium complexes as photosensitizers. The turnover numbers based on the catalyst and the yield of ammonia based on the manganese-nitride complex reached up to 150 equiv. and 91%, respectively, indicating the high durability and effi-ciency of this photocatalytic system. Moreover, this hydrogenation proceeded photocatalytically even under 0.05 atm of dihydrogen, which was a much lower partial pressure compared to the previous systems reported by other re-search groups.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-bdhgx?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Rotation, Vibration, Torsion Coupling Effects in the Spectrum of Dimethyl Sulfide</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-74vrs?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The room temperature, high-resolution (8-16 MHz) rovibrational absorption spectrum of low-pressure dimethyl sulfide [Konnov et al., J. Chem. Phys. 2025, 37, 109690] shows spectral congestion at transition energies as low as  ~ 1000 cm-1 . The origin of this congestion is investigated theoretically by developing a rotation-torsion-vibration Hamiltonian and dipole moment surface that allow us to model the excitation of the methyl rocking vibrations that are excited in the experiment. The vibrations that are described by this  Hamiltonian include the two torsions and the seven  additional low-frequency vibrations with harmonic frequencies below 1100 cm-1.  The effect of Coriolis coupling is minimized by defining a body-fixed embedding that satisfies the Eckart condition at the nine equivalent minima on the potential surface. The couplings between the torsions and vibrations, especially for those states excited in  hot-band transitions, lead to substantial state mixing. Not only does this state mixing lead to spectral congestion due to intensity borrowing, it also leads to the quartet of transitions, which  are associated with the torsional tunneling of the two methyl groups, becoming spectrally distinct at the experimental resolution. These combined effects lead to model spectrum with similar levels of congestion as are observed experimentally, allowing us to deconvolute the various contributions to this low-energy spectral congestion.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-74vrs?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Despite being discovered over 40 years ago, TS-1 is seeing an increase in use in the chemical industry. The catalyst structure, especially the Ti speciation and local environment in the zeolitic framework as well as the nuclearity of the Ti sites in the pristine zeolite material are still debated. Here, we address this issue by applying high field (28.2 T) 47/49Ti NMR and 17O NMR spectroscopy, for an array of TS-1 catalysts. For extra-framework-free TS-1 catalysts the Ti sites are associated with a distinct NMR signature – δiso (49Ti) = -900 ppm; CQ,0(49Ti) = 7.2 MHz – which can be translated into structural parameters and a dominant first coordination environment according to an extended Czjzek model. With the implementation of a 47/49Ti NMR crystallography protocol, benchmarked on molecular models, this signature was assigned to the presence of mononuclear Ti framework sites in pristine TS-1 structures. The observed distribution of the NMR parameters presumably originates from variations of mononuclear Ti framework sites in the first and second coordination sphere, likely due to the occupancy of several T-sites.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-c765h-v3?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Polypharmacology Browser PPB3: A Web-based Deep Learning Tool for Target Prediction Using ChEMBL Data</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-rlgq5-v3?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Drug-like molecules often interact with multiple biological targets. Assessing this polypharmacology is essential for drug development. Here we trained deep neural networks to associate bioactive molecules up to 80 non-hydrogen atoms in size reported in ChEMBL 34, represented as binary substructure fingerprints, with lists of targets on which the molecules are 50% active at ≤10 µM. We included 2,496,555 interactions between 1,187,089 molecules and 7,546 targets having at least five reported active molecules, including single proteins, protein complexes, protein families, cell lines, organisms, and further target types. This represents a much larger dataset than previously reported models, which were mostly limited to protein targets. Our DNNs achieve good performance in terms of recall and precision per molecule and per target, as illustrated by overall statistics and by a case study in comparison with other online prediction tools.

A solar-powered lithium-water cogeneration system is further proposed that integrates purification, concentration, and water recovery, enabling water- and energy-sustainable operation across the full extraction workflow.</description><author>Joule</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00451-9?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] LivePyxel: Accelerating image annotations with a Python-integrated webcam live streaming</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00421G</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, Accepted Manuscript&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00421G, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY-NC.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Uriel Garcilazo-Cruz, Joseph O.

In this study, full-lifecycle pulsed electrical aging tests were conducted on biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) films. Experimental results reveal that the blisters formed on the surface of electrically aged BOPP films are cavity-structured bubbles, which essentially represent a distinct form of “latent electrical weakness” arising from irreversible material degradation under multi-field electro–thermo–mechanical coupling. Furthermore, a physical model and equivalent impedance were established for these bubbles, providing additional evidence that the blisters play a decisive role in the degradation of the breakdown performance of BOPP films.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/2/022901/3377312/A-weakness-breakdown-model-of-a-BOPP-film-based-on</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] 214 MW/cm 2  vertical  β -Ga 2 O 3  UMOSFETs enabled by HF sidewall treatment</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/2/022107/3377311/214-MW-cm2-vertical-Ga2O3-UMOSFETs-enabled-by-HF</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Vertical &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;β&lt;/span&gt;-Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; U-shaped trench structures (UMOSFETs) incorporating current-blocking layers typically suffer from increased on-resistance, primarily caused by deep-level defect states in the trench sidewalls that trap free electrons. In this study, the hydrofluoric acid (HF) sidewall treatment was introduced prior to gate dielectric deposition to modify the trench surface. This process enables the effective incorporation of fluorine atoms into the sidewall region, increasing the electron concentration and mitigating the compensation associated with deep acceptor levels from heavy nitrogen implantation. As a result, the forward conduction is improved. In addition, the HF treatment partially passivates surface and interface traps and provides a mild polishing effect, which slightly reduces surface roughness. These changes help suppress interface scattering and further enhance carrier transport. The fabricated vertical &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;β&lt;/span&gt;-Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; UMOSFETs achieved a specific on-resistance of 6.0 mΩ cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a channel mobility of 19.1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/V s, and a breakdown voltage of 1132 V. These results demonstrate that HF sidewall treatment provides a simple and efficient surface engineering approach for significantly enhancing the conduction performance and overall electrical characteristics of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;β&lt;/span&gt;-Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; UMOSFETs.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/2/022107/3377311/214-MW-cm2-vertical-Ga2O3-UMOSFETs-enabled-by-HF</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Dissociating neural circuits of social and prosocial reward in rat helping behavior</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00069-6?rss=yes</link><description>Helping behavior in rodents provides a powerful model for studying neurobiological underpinnings of prosocial motivation. Previously, rats allowed to release a trapped conspecific demonstrated prosocial motivation selectively toward ingroup members. Here, a refined version of the Helping Behavior Test (HBT) allowed trapped rats to be freed without ensuing social contact, dissociating social from prosocial reward. In this “separated” HBT (SHBT), helping was not biased, as rats equally released ingroup and outgroup members.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00069-6?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Gut fungal landscape in colorectal cancer and its cross-kingdom interplay with gut microbial ecology</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00039-8?rss=yes</link><description>The gut microbiota is a key hallmark of colorectal cancer (CRC), yet gut fungi remain understudied. We characterized the gut fungal landscape and its associations with bacteria, metabolites, and trace elements in CRC using fecal samples from healthy controls (n = 401), colorectal polyp patients (n = 162), and CRC patients (n = 253). Fungal annotation was performed using genomic data from NCBI (PRJNA833221) as reference. Fungal diversity increased in CRC patients, with seven genera showing differential abundance.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00039-8?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[Nature] Daily briefing: Same-sex sex is a normal part of some primates’ lives</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00149-z</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature, Published online: 13 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00149-z"&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-026-00149-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Same-sex sexual behaviour could help some primates cope with complex social hierarchies.

Abstract: Amorphous elastomers exhibit significant rate-stiffening and unique viscous flow characteristics across a wide range of strain rates, often undergoing glass transition above a strain rate threshold. We have developed a thermodynamically-consistent and micromechanically-inspired constitutive model for soft elastomeric materials to capture the rate-dependent stress-strain behavior and hysteresis when subjected to low to high strain rates. Our proposed constitutive model encapsulates the viscous flow of materials through molecular motion at low strain rates and local rearrangement and alignment at high strain rates, essentially covering the glass transition. We applied our constitutive model to uniaxial compression experiments performed at low and high strain rates for polyborosiloxane (PBS) to identify the material parameters, and subsequently, performed numerical simulations of single and multi-cycle compression, stress relaxation, and small amplitude oscillatory tension-compression. Our analyses indicate that the model predicts higher total energy dissipation with increasing strain rate; however, dissipation associated with molecular relaxation decreases (forming a cusp) because, beyond a crossover strain rate, molecular rearrangement and alignment become dominant, which is consistent with the onset of the glass transition. For cyclic loading-unloading, we observed that dissipation over a cycle remains constant at low strain rate but decreases non-monotonically at high strain rates before becoming constant with peak stress over the cycle becoming higher, which can be interpreted as more loading being carried elastically by the polymer network as the molecular rearrangement process occurs. Additionally, our model was able to predict the qualitative nature of the storage modulus and loss modulus in the limit of small strain over a wide range of frequency sweeps.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05405v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Coupled Spin-lattice Dynamics across a Magnetostructural Phase Transition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05458</link><description>arXiv:2601.05458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-order magnetostructural phase transitions underpin giant magnetocaloric effects, yet the microscopic role of lattice dynamics in these transitions remains controversial. Here we use first-principles spin-lattice dynamics simulations to investigate the coupled evolution of magnetization and phonon dispersions across the magnetostructural transition in MnAs. Our simulations quantitatively reproduce the experimentally observed Curie temperature, lattice contraction, and free-energy crossing between hexagonal and orthorhombic phases. We show that below the Curie temperature, magnetic-field-induced hardening of soft phonon modes gives rise to a sizable lattice entropy contribution that enhances the total isothermal entropy change by approximately 23% under a 5 T field. In contrast, the lattice entropy change associated with the structural phase transition itself has an opposite sign and partially compensates the lattice contribution due to field-induced phonon hardening. This competition reconciles long-standing discrepancies in the interpretation of magnetocaloric entropy measurements across first-order transitions. In addition, we demonstrate that the strong magnetic-field dependence of the phonon spectrum near the transition enables large tunability of lattice thermal conductivity, highlighting MnAs as a promising platform for magnetic-field-controlled thermal switching. Our results establish a unified microscopic picture of spin-lattice coupling in first-order magnetocaloric materials and provide design principles for engineering enhanced caloric and thermal transport functionalities.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05458v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Molecular Orbital Degeneracy Lifting in a Tetrahedral Cluster System NbSeI</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05562</link><description>arXiv:2601.05562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lifting of degenerate electronic states, in which multiple electronic states share the same energy, is a fundamental issue in the physics of crystalline solids. In real materials, this problem has been extensively studied in transition metal compounds, where various quantum phenomena arise from the spin and orbital degeneracy of the d electrons on individual transition-metal atoms. In contrast, materials containing high-symmetry clusters composed of multiple transition-metal atoms are expected to exhibit more emergent phenomena due to the entanglement of the electronic degrees of freedom across multiple atoms. Here, we report the discovery of two distinct mechanisms of orbital-degeneracy lifting in NbSeI, which comprises Nb4 tetrahedral clusters with molecular orbital degrees of freedom and whose average crystal structure is predicted to host a flat-band metal. Below 106 K, NbSeI is found to be a nonmagnetic molecular orbital-ordered insulator. Above this temperature, the average structure becomes face-centered cubic without any superlattice, while the orbital degeneracy remains lifted by significant local distortions of Nb4 tetrahedra, which may be associated with a molecular orbital-liquid or orbital-frozen state. This noncooperative Jahn-Teller distortion stabilizes a nonmagnetic insulating state above 106 K, in stark contrast to the flat-band metal predicted from the average structure.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05562v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Transport characteristics in Hermitian and non-Hermitian Fibonacci rings: A comparative study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05743</link><description>arXiv:2601.05743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extensive theoretical analysis of transport and circular currents and the associated induced magnetic fields in Fibonacci rings, explored in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian descriptions, with particular attention to configurations preserving or breaking PT symmetry. By engineering physically balanced gain and loss following a Fibonacci sequence, we realize two distinct geometrical configurations in which the ring either preserve or explicitly break PT symmetry, and further explore complementary realizations obtained by reversing the signs of the on site potentials. Using the non equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism, we analyze transmission properties and bond current densities to quantify both transport and circulating currents. A comparison with the Hermitian limit establishes a clear baseline, where the ring supports only weak responses upon introducing disorder. In sharp contrast, non-Hermiticity leads to a pronounced amplification of transport and circular currents, and hence of the induced magnetic field. We further demonstrate that non-Hermitian transport is highly sensitive to gain and loss sign reversal and, in the non-PT-symmetric case, exhibits an unconventional dependence on system size governed by the parity of the Fibonacci sequence and hopping correlations. Remarkably, the current does not decay monotonically with increasing system size, revealing a distinct scaling behavior absent in conventional Hermitian systems. Our results highlight non-Hermitian quasiperiodic rings as versatile platforms for engineering and amplifying current driven magnetic responses through symmetry, topology, and gain-loss design.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05743v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Phase-space networks and connectivity of the kagome antiferromagnet</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05933</link><description>arXiv:2601.05933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the coplanar ground-state manifold of the kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet using a phase-space network representation, in which nodes correspond to coplanar ground states and edges represent transitions generated by weathervane loop rotations. In the coplanar manifold, each configuration can be mapped to a three-coloring problem on the dual honeycomb lattice, where a weathervane mode corresponds to a closed loop of two alternating colors. By comparing networks that include all weathervane loops with networks restricted to elementary six-spin loops, we examine how energetic constraints shape phase-space structure. We find that connectivity distributions are sharply peaked in large systems, while restrictions to short loops reduce typical connectivity. Spectral properties further distinguish the two cases, with short-loop networks exhibiting Gaussian spectra and full networks displaying non-Gaussian features associated with correlated loop updates. Finally, a box-counting analysis reveals distinct fractal properties of the two networks, demonstrating how energetic constraints control the global geometry of configuration space. These results show that the hierarchy of weathervane loop rotations provides a direct link between microscopic constraints and emergent phase-space geometry in a frustrated magnet.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05933v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Modeling phononic band gap in microstructured solids using the Riemann-Cartan geometric framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05402</link><description>arXiv:2601.05402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling acoustic wave fields in microstructured elastic solids is discussed in the context of the Riemann-Cartan geometry. We consider a scenario where microstructural deformations occur much faster than those of the bulk material. This time-scale separation creates apparent geometric incompatibilities at the macroscopic level, even without any permanent inelastic deformation (at micro or macro-scale) or damage. We formalize this phenomenon using the concept of a non-holonomic tetrads to represent the macroscopic elastic deformations and the associated torsion field to characterize the resulting geometric incompatibilities. The spatial components of the torsion tensor quantify the instantaneous geometric incompatibility of the macroscopic elastic deformations, while its time components capture the inertial effects arising from the reversible energy exchange between the micro and macro scales. A key finding is that the model's dispersion relation predicts the existence of a complete frequency band gap. Furthermore, the governing equations exhibit a notable mathematical analogy to Maxwell's equations which can link the modeling of phononic and photonic metamaterials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05402v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Magnetodynamics of short nanoparticle chains</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01561</link><description>arXiv:2408.01561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the understanding and application of nanoparticle assemblies driven by external fields. Although these systems can exhibit marked transitions in behavior compared to non-interacting counterparts, it has often proven challenging to connect their dynamics with underlying physical mechanisms or even to verifiably establish their structure under realistic experimental conditions. We have studied colloidal iron oxide nanoparticles that assemble into ordered, few-particle linear chains under the influence of oscillating and pulsed magnetic fields. In this work, our goal has been to answer the following question: by what physical mechanisms does the magnetic switching of a linear chain evolve from the switching of its constituent particles? Cryo-TEM has been used to flash freeze and image the structures formed by oscillatory drive fields, and magnetic relaxometry has been used to extract the multiple time constants associated with magnetic switching of the short chains. Armed with the physical structure from microscopy and the field-dependent switching times from magnetic measurements, we have conducted extensive micromagnetic simulations, revealing probable physical mechanisms for each time constant regime spanning ~1 microsecond to 1 s in time. These types of magnetic nanomaterials have great potential for biomedical technologies, particularly magnetic particle imaging and hyperthermia, and rigorous elucidation of their physics will hasten their optimization.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2408.01561v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Efficient Band Structure Unfolding with Atom-centered Orbitals: General Theory and Application</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21089</link><description>arXiv:2506.21089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Band structure unfolding is a key technique for analyzing and simplifying the electronic band structure of large, internally distorted supercells that break the primitive cell's translational symmetry. In this work, we present an efficient band unfolding method for atomic orbital (AO) basis sets that explicitly accounts for both the non-orthogonality of atomic orbitals and their atom-centered nature. Unlike existing approaches that typically rely on a plane-wave representation of the (semi-)valence states, we here derive analytical expressions that recasts the primitive cell translational operator and the associated Bloch-functions in the supercell AO basis. In turn, this enables the accurate and efficient unfolding of conduction, valence, and core states in all-electron codes, as demonstrated by our implementation in the all-electron ab initio simulation package FHI-aims, which employs numeric atom-centered orbitals. We explicitly demonstrate the capability of running large-scale unfolding calculations for systems with thousands of atoms and showcase the importance of this technique for computing temperature-dependent spectral functions in strongly anharmonic materials using CuI as example.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.21089v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Temperature dependence of $p$-wave contacts in a harmonically trapped Fermi gas</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04738</link><description>arXiv:2509.04738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dependence of the $p$-wave contact on the Fermi temperature $T_F$ and reduced temperature $T/T_F$ based on the number of closed-channel molecules. From the anisotropic pattern of dissociated molecules, we resolve the narrow $m=0$ and $m=\pm1$ dipolar splitting of the $p$-wave Feshbach resonance in $^6$Li, enabling the independent determination of the contact for all three $m$ components. For each component, we identify a near-resonant scaling with $\sqrt{T_F}$, indicating the contribution of the normalized effective range $k_F R_{\rm{e}}$. In addition, we show that the peak contacts observed near resonance increase as $T/T_F$ is lowered, a trend that is accurately captured by estimates based on the second-order virial expansion. Our results, together with estimates from the $p$-wave virial expansion, provide a route toward a complete understanding of the thermodynamics of resonantly enhanced $p$-wave Fermi gases.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.04738v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Building cluster systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19868</link><description>arXiv:2509.19868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical spin liquids are frustrated magnetic phases characterized by local constraints, flat bands in reciprocal space, and emergent gauge structures with distinctive signatures such as pinch points. These arise generally in \emph{cluster systems}, where spin interactions can be expressed as constraints on clusters of spins. In this work we present the different generic rules allowing to build such cluster systems together with a few tools allowing to quickly characterize it. We show that based on these rules, it is possible to conceive a tunable recipe for generating such models by decorating a parent lattice on its bonds and/or vertices with symmetry-compatible clusters. This approach highlights a key design trade-off: using fewer cluster types increases the number of flat bands and enhances spin-liquid behavior, but produces denser connectivity that is harder to realize experimentally. The framework is highly tunable, extends naturally to two and three dimensions, and provides a versatile toolbox for engineering new classical spin-liquid candidates with targeted features such as higher-rank pinch points or pinch lines. Among the catalog of cluster systems generated following the decoration scheme, a common feature appears to be the existence of additional flat bands in the spectrum, which motivates a detailed study of the origin of these flat bands and their associated physics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.19868v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Disordered Dynamics in High Dimensions: Connections to Random Matrices and Machine Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01010</link><description>arXiv:2601.01010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an overview of high dimensional dynamical systems driven by random matrices, focusing on applications to simple models of learning and generalization in machine learning theory. Using both cavity method arguments and path integrals, we review how the behavior of a coupled infinite dimensional system can be characterized as a stochastic process for each single site of the system. We provide a pedagogical treatment of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), a framework that can be flexibly applied to these settings. The DMFT single site stochastic process is fully characterized by a set of (two-time) correlation and response functions. For linear time-invariant systems, we illustrate connections between random matrix resolvents and the DMFT response. We demonstrate applications of these ideas to machine learning models such as gradient flow, stochastic gradient descent on random feature models and deep linear networks in the feature learning regime trained on random data. We demonstrate how bias and variance decompositions (analysis of ensembling/bagging etc) can be computed by averaging over subsets of the DMFT noise variables. From our formalism we also investigate how linear systems driven with random non-Hermitian matrices (such as random feature models) can exhibit non-monotonic loss curves with training time, while Hermitian matrices with the matching spectra do not, highlighting a different mechanism for non-monotonicity than small eigenvalues causing instability to label noise. Lastly, we provide asymptotic descriptions of the training and test loss dynamics for randomly initialized deep linear neural networks trained in the feature learning regime with high-dimensional random data. In this case, the time translation invariance structure is lost and the hidden layer weights are characterized as spiked random matrices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01010v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Non-Hermitian topological superfluidity in a three-dimensional fermi gas with spin-orbit coupling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01790</link><description>arXiv:2601.01790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The experimental advances in realizing artificial spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and non-Hermitian potentials in ultracold atomic system open a new avenue for exploring their significant roles in quantum many-body physics. Here, we investigate a non-Hermitian, two-component Fermi system in a cubic lattice with Rashba SOC and complex-valued interaction arising from two-body loss. We adopt the non-Hermitian mean field theory and map out the phase diagram at zero temperature. The interplay of dissipation and on-site interaction drives a dissipation-induced phase transition from superfluid (SF) to normal phase (N). Notably, for weak interaction strengths, this leads to a reentrance of the superfluid state. The presence of SOC significantly expands the parameter regime for both the normal phase and the metastable superfluid phase(MSF). Whereas, the Zeeman field can drive the system from a conventional superfluid into a topological superfluid phase(TSF), characterized by a nontrivial topological invariant. These results enrich our knowledge of pairing superfluidity in Fermi systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01790v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Multiscale Experimental Evidence of a Transitory State in the HDA-LDA Transition in Alumino-sodo-silicate Glasses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03021</link><description>arXiv:2601.03021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The structural evolution with temperature of pure silica (SiO2), sodium-silicate (5Na2O-95SiO2, 10Na2O-90SiO2 and 25Na2O-75SiO2) and albite (15Na2O-15Al2O3-75SiO2) glasses previously densified from hot compression is monitored with a combination of small and wide angle x-ray scattering. Transient scattering maxima in the length scales associated with both techniques indicate the presence of a transitory state, suggesting the classification of the initial and final states as distinct glass states in the context of polyamorphism. In all glasses, a transient intensity peak in the small angle scattering is observed, consistent with the nucleation of a new amorphous state. Based on a comparison with the phenomenology observed in supercooled and glassy water, we propose that this structural evolution provide a strong evidence of the glass polyamorphism as the consequence of the existence of an underlying but thermodynamically defined liquid-liquid transition, independent on the polymerization degree of the system.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03021v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Solving Inverse Problems in Stochastic Self-Organizing Systems through Invariant Representations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11796</link><description>arXiv:2506.11796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-organizing systems demonstrate how simple local rules can generate complex stochastic patterns. Many natural systems rely on such dynamics, making self-organization central to understanding natural complexity. A fundamental challenge in modeling such systems is solving the inverse problem: finding the unknown causal parameters from macroscopic observations. This task becomes particularly difficult when observations have a strong stochastic component, yielding diverse yet equivalent patterns. Traditional inverse methods fail in this setting, as pixel-wise metrics cannot capture feature similarities between variable outcomes. In this work, we introduce a novel inverse modeling method specifically designed to handle stochasticity in the observable space, leveraging the capacity of visual embeddings to produce robust representations that capture perceptual invariances. By mapping the pattern representations onto an invariant embedding space, we can effectively recover unknown causal parameters without the need for handcrafted objective functions or heuristics. We evaluate the method on three self-organizing systems: a physical, a biological, and a social one; namely, a reaction-diffusion system, a model of embryonic development, and an agent-based model of social segregation. We show that the method reliably recovers parameters despite stochasticity in the pattern outcomes. We further apply the method to real biological patterns, highlighting its potential as a tool for both theorists and experimentalists to investigate the dynamics underlying complex stochastic pattern formation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.11796v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] What is emergence, after all?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04951</link><description>arXiv:2507.04951v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The term emergence is increasingly used across scientific disciplines to describe phenomena that arise from interactions among a system's components but cannot be readily inferred by examining those components in isolation. While often invoked to explain higher-level behaviors, such as flocking, synchronization, or collective intelligence, the term is frequently used without precision, sometimes giving rise to ambiguity or even mystique. In this perspective paper, we clarify the scientific meaning of emergence as a measurable and physically grounded phenomenon. Through concrete examples, such as temperature, magnetism, and herd immunity in social networks, we review how collective behavior can arise from local interactions that are constrained by global boundaries. By refining the concept of emergence, we gain a clearer and more grounded understanding of complex systems. Our goal is to show that emergence, when properly framed, offers not mysticism but insight.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.04951v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Generalized Wigner theorem for non-invertible symmetries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25327</link><description>arXiv:2509.25327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the conditions under which a conservation law associated with a non-invertible operator may be realized as a symmetry in quantum mechanics. As established by Wigner, all quantum symmetries must be represented by either unitary or antiunitary transformations. Relinquishing an implicit assumption of invertibility, we demonstrate that the fundamental invariance of quantum transition probabilities under the application of symmetries mandates that all non-invertible symmetries may only correspond to {\it projective} unitary or antiunitary transformations, i.e., {\it partial isometries}. This extends the notion of physical states beyond conventional rays in Hilbert space to equivalence classes in an {\it extended, gauged Hilbert space}, thereby broadening the traditional understanding of symmetry transformations in quantum theory. We discuss consequences of this result and explicitly illustrate how, in simple model systems, whether symmetries be invertible or non-invertible may be inextricably related to the particular boundary conditions that are being used.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.25327v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] LACIN: Linearly Arranged Complete Interconnection Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05668</link><description>arXiv:2601.05668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several interconnection networks are based on the complete graph topology. Networks with a moderate size can be based on a single complete graph. However, large-scale networks such as Dragonfly and HyperX use, respectively, a hierarchical or a multi-dimensional composition of complete graphs.
  The number of links in these networks is huge and grows rapidly with their size. This paper introduces LACIN, a set of complete graph implementations that use identically indexed ports to link switches. This way of implementing the network reduces the complexity of its cabling and its routing. LACIN eases the deployment of networks for parallel computers of different scales, from VLSI systems to the largest supercomputers.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05668v1</guid></item><item><title>[Nature] AIs are biased toward some Indian castes — how can researchers fix this?</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-04041-0</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature, Published online: 12 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-04041-0"&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-025-04041-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Benchmarks reveal how artificial-intelligence systems reinforce discriminatory social hierarchies.</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-04041-0</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Quaternary biopesticides and disinfectants derived from quinine and amino acids – environmental prospects and risks</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-h5hbb-v3?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The numerous risks associated with the toxicity of conventional quaternary ammonium salts (QASs) to various groups of living organisms have prompted the search for new, safer biologically active compounds synthesized in a sustainable manner from renewable raw materials. Here, we describe new QASs of natural origin containing quinine-based cation and anions derived from proteinogenic amino acids – L-asparagine and L-alanine. The quinine-derived QASs were thoroughly characterized in terms of correctness of chemical structure, physicochemical properties, and biological activity. It was discovered that due to quinine activity, the new salts exhibit strong antifeedant activity toward stored products pests, and in the case of elongation of the alkyl substituent in the 1-alkylquininium cation, they also become potent disinfectants. The performed analyses also allowed to assess the environmental risk by determining toxicity to monocotyledonous (Sorghum bicolor) and dicotyledonous (Sinapis alba) terrestial plants, freshwater algae (Chlorella vulgaris) and crustaceans (Daphnia magna) at various concentrations of the test substance. None of the QASs of natural origin showed phytotoxicity, and salts containing short alkyl substituents in quinine-based cations were noticeably less toxic to aquatic organisms than the other tested compounds. The results indicate that although a trade-off between antimicrobial activity and aquatic toxicity must be made when designing new quinine-based antiseptics, it is possible to obtain potent, naturally-derived and relatively low-toxic biopesticides based on quinine and amino acids.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-h5hbb-v3?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] A Reversible ATR-FTIR Biosensor with Single Residue Sensitivity</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-8875c?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Infrared spectroscopy provides label-free access to protein structure information with high sensitivity. Challenges in infrared spectroscopy include artifacts arising from temperature changes, baseline drifts and the strong water absorption, especially in difference spectroscopy, where signals are orders of magnitude smaller than the total absorbance. Previously, we introduced an ATR-based immuno-infrared sensor (iRS) based on sophisticated surface chemistry. This provides a stable platform for covalent protein immobilization and allows its application with body fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid or blood without unspecific background. It detects misfolding of small amounts of antigen (Abeta or alpha-synuclein) by binding to an antibody or antibody fragment, which allows for the diagnosis of various neurodegenerative diseases.  Here, we extend this platform by introducing reversible binding via the NColE7/Im7 pair. Im7-tagged proteins are captured with sub-picomolar affinity and quantitatively released under mild conditions (high salt or low pH), allowing repeated capture-regeneration cycles with continuous spectral monitoring of the Im7 fusion protein. Using an Im7-antibody Fab fusion protein, we present a reusable immune-IR sensor that enables multiple measurements on the same surface. For example, different antibodies can be used for differential screening. Using alternating Im7 protein attachments to the internal reflection element, we further compare Im7 single point mutants to wild-type Im7 to resolve infrared signatures of specific amino acid substitutions. Difference spectra reveal the distinct tyrosine absorption associated with either the introduction or removal of a single tyrosine residue, providing the first proof-of-concept for difference spectroscopy with single-residue sensitivity based on complete protein exchange.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-8875c?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Eyring's Rate Theory and Its Connection to Entropy Scaling: Viscosity and Self-Diffusion of Hydrocarbons, Alcohols, and Water</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-nbhbq-v3?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Eyring's absolute rate theory relates fluid flow with the activation energy necessary for a molecule to go from one equilibrium position to another. Developed nearly a century ago, it remains a powerful approach for understanding transport processes in liquids. This work presents a revision of Eyring's theory by replacing the vaporization-based parts of the theory with a residual approach that conceptualizes transport as local (re)movement of molecules within the system rather than removal from it. In this new approach, the energy barrier corresponds to the difference between a molecule with and without intermolecular interactions, effectively treating it as the residual property related to an ideal gas reference state. Furthermore, we explore the physical connections between Eyring's absolute rate theory and Rosenfeld excess entropy scaling, revealing that both approaches describe complementary aspects of the same transport phenomena. It is tempting to link both theories. The activation parameters in Eyring's theory, particularly the energy of activation, are shown to relate to the residual entropy used in entropy scaling. This provides a pathway to establish entropy scaling on a more rigorous physical foundation while offering deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms governing viscous flow. In comparison to experimental data, the revised theory demonstrated significant predictive power for viscosity across a wide range of thermodynamic conditions and species, including associating liquids. Moreover, parameters are transferable to other properties, such as self-diffusion.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-nbhbq-v3?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

In non–small cell lung cancer, immune checkpoint inhibitors have improved outcomes, and senescence programs can influence antigen presentation, immune cell recruitment, and adaptive resistance. This Review integrates evidence from cell and animal models, patient-derived datasets, and early clinical studies to map senescent cell states across cancer immunoediting and treatment contexts.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00048-9?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[Nature] Same-sex sexual behaviour can help primates to survive — and reproduce</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00119-5</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature, Published online: 12 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00119-5"&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-026-00119-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Bonds between same-sex individuals help apes and monkeys to manage conflict and strengthen alliances, especially in dry habitats and predator-rich landscapes.</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00119-5</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Cultural diversity of religion across 117 countries</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67671-y</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 12 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67671-y"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-025-67671-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Societies differ widely in cultural values across the world.

The inherently weak spin–orbit coupling (SOC) in organic materials makes them ideal candidates for spin transport. However, the strong electron–phonon (e-p) coupling and hyperfine interactions would decrease the carrier mobility. In addition, complex phenomena such as singlet-triplet conversion, carrier recombination, and the existence of impurities and defects contribute to complex spin relaxation mechanisms. This review provides an overview of spin injection and transport processes in organic materials, with an emphasis on their spin-dependent optical responses. Common methods of light-controlled spin manipulation are reviewed, along with the interaction between photons and spins. Ultrafast optical techniques for spin control are also briefly discussed. This work aims to deepen our understanding of photon-spin coupling in organic systems and provide insights that may contribute to the advancement of organic opto-spintronics.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/13/1/011308/3377206/Manipulating-spins-in-organic-and-chiral-systems</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Inhalable Platelet Membrane-Camouflaged Matrine Biomimetic Nanoparticles for Efficient Acute Lung Injury Therapy</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00058-1?rss=yes</link><description>Sepsis frequently progresses to acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which are associated with high mortality. Current treatments face limitations due to resistance and toxicity. Matrine, a component of traditional Chinese medicine, exhibits anti-inflammatory properties but suffers from poor selectivity and potential toxicity. To address these challenges, this study developed platelet membrane-coated matrine nanoparticles (PM@Mat-NPs) for targeted ALI treatment.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00058-1?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] ERG Phase Separation Attenuates Cellular Senescence</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00053-2?rss=yes</link><description>Centenarians, individuals who reach extreme old age, provide a valuable model for understanding mechanisms associated with healthy aging. Using ATAC-seq and transcriptomic profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from centenarians, we identified a distinct chromatin accessibility landscape linked to exceptional longevity. Integrative analysis highlighted the ETS-related transcription factor ERG as a longevity-associated regulator. Functional studies in human cells showed that ERG forms nuclear condensates through liquid–liquid phase separation, a property associated with altered chromatin organization and reduced expression of senescence-related genes, including CDKN2A.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid

Yet, mechanical activation of ferrocene or its irradiation when heavily distorted by strain leads to Fe–cyclopentadienyl bond scission. However, a direct link between simultaneous mechanical force transduction and photoactivation has never been established. Here, we show that light can harness stored mechanical energy to induce the metal–ligand bond dissociation. A family of ferrocene–cycloparaphenylene nanohoops (Fc[n]CPP, n = 6–8) releases Fe²⁺ efficiently under visible light, even when the ferrocene unit itself is unstrained. X-ray crystal structure analysis, quantum yield measurements, and excited-state calculations reveal that reactivity scales with strain localized in the aromatic hoop-like ligand, not with distortion at the metal center. This correlation identifies the hoop as an internal stress reservoir that lowers the triplet-state barrier for Fe–cyclopentadienyl cleavage. By coupling mechanical bias to photochemical reactivity, this work establishes a concept of photomechanophores, molecular units in which light and mechanical activation operate in concert. Thereby, we lay foundation of a general framework for designing tunable photocages and new force-responsive materials that can be modulated by light.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-7g2pt?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Driving Forces of Amyloid Protofibril Stability</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-skt9d?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Amyloid protofibrils are highly ordered protein assemblies characterized by a high content of β-sheets and are implicated in a wide range of pathological conditions. Amyloid crystals represent a distinct polymorphic form of amyloid assemblies that arise from the progressive untwisting and lateral association of twisted ribbon fibrils and correspond to the ground state of the protein folding and aggregation energy landscape. However, the driving forces underlying these processes remain difficult to quantify at the molecular level and from a quantum-chemical perspective. Here, we present a computational framework that combines molecular dynamics simulations, the Jarzynski estimator, and symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) to evaluate the potential of mean force associated with peptide transfer either from a soluble state to a crystalline protofibril or from the protofibril into the surrounding microenvironment. We apply this approach to the NNQQ peptide, which has been shown by X-ray microcrystallography to form amyloid fibrils composed of parallel β-strands in the presence of alkali halide salts (Nature 447, 453–457 (2007)). Structural stability increases from Na+ to K+, driven by enhanced ion-peptide electrostatic interactions as revealed by SAPT analysis. Furthermore, quantum-chemical analysis reveals a clear polarity-dependence in the dominant stabilizing forces of amyloid protofibrils. The highly polar NNQQ polymorphs are stabilized mainly by induction (charge transfer and polarization) and dispersion interactions, whereas the highly apolar MVGGVV polymorphs from the amyloid-β sequence are determined predominantly by electrostatic and dispersion contributions. Together, this multidimensional framework establishes a quantitative, molecular-level foundation for understanding amyloid stability and its modulation by environmental conditions and protein identity. More broadly, it provides a general and transferable strategy for assessing amyloid stability and for rationally designing inhibitors that disrupt amyloid assemblies.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-skt9d?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Communications Physics] Smile-shaped electron gradient distributions observed during magnetic reconnection at Earth’s magnetopause</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-026-02489-8</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Communications Physics, Published online: 10 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-026-02489-8"&gt;doi:10.1038/s42005-026-02489-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Electron distributions exhibit velocity-space signatures indicative of the rapid energy released by magnetic reconnection explosions occurring in Earth’s magnetosphere and in plasmas throughout the universe.

In most previous cross-metathesis approaches, acrylonitrile has been employed as the CM partner olefin. While internal olefins such as cis-2-butene-1,4-diol have been explored in metathesis reactions, their use without protecting groups has remained challenging. In this study, the unprotected diol enables direct access to highly functionalized intermediates, avoids dimer formation associated with terminal olefins, and allows subsequent isomerization in a single step. Efficient CM was acheived at low temperature (0 °C) using a Stewart-Grubbs catalyst, affording CM product 4 in excellent yield. Compound 4 was readily converted to alcohol 10, aldehyde 13, and olefin 9 in a single step and in &gt;90% yields. These intermediates are useful precursors for specialty chemicals, including 11-aminoundecanoate, the precursor of PA11. A tandem CM/isomerization process from 4 to 13 was also demonstrated for the first time.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2022-5c8x9-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Abstract: This work presents a pedagogical derivation of the thermodynamics of a van der Waals fluid by explicitly incorporating pairwise molecular interactions and the finite size of particles into the statistical-mechanical description. Starting from the Lennard-Jones potential, we evaluate the second virial coefficient to infer the virial expansion of the equation of state and recover the van der Waals equation using only its leading correction. The corresponding partition function allows us to obtain all thermodynamic potentials for both monoatomic and diatomic fluids in a transparent and instructive manner.
  Building on this framework, we formulate and solve analytically the Clausius-Clapeyron equation in the vicinity of the critical point, obtaining the liquid-vapor coexistence curve in closed form. This approach not only clarifies the microscopic origin of van der Waals thermodynamics but also complements-and in several aspects improves upon-traditional treatments that rely heavily on numerical methods or heuristic arguments.
  In addition, because the van der Waals equation naturally predicts the liquid-vapor equilibrium, the existence of critical points, and the functional form of the saturation curve of the pressure as a function of temperature, it provides an analytically tractable framework for studying a 150-year-old problem that has historically been addressed using graphical constructions or numerical solutions. As such, the formulation developed here offers a coherent, accessible, and conceptually unified route for students and instructors to understand phase coexistence in simple fluids from first principles.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04296v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Fast Phase Logic Family for Achieving Very Large Scale Integration in Superconductor Electronics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04363</link><description>arXiv:2601.04363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Phase Logic (FPL) is a novel digital superconductor electronic (SCE) logic family specifically designed to address critical challenges in state-of-the-art SCE, such as low device density and integration levels. The FPL family improves circuit performance by employing various Josephson junction (JJ) structures, including high-$J_c$ self-shunted 0-JJ stacks, $\pi$-JJs, and 0/$\pi$-JJ stacks. FPL utilizes 0- and $\pi$-JJs to replace the bulky geometric inductors required in single flux quantum (SFQ) logic families like RSFQ. The proposed FPL family can deliver up to two orders of magnitude improvement in integration density over RSFQ logic with a five-fold reduction in the bias current requirements. Circuit performance is enhanced with reduced latency and increased throughput. Furthermore, the FPL family provides a higher output voltage level and higher impedance, which better match those of CMOS circuits. The much smaller flux storage loops in FPL greatly reduce susceptibility to trapped flux and crosstalk. Advancements in fabrication processes that would further benefit FPL implementation include the use of NbTiN-based JJs with higher critical current density and fabrication temperature range up to 400~$^\circ$C, or the use of stacked JJ structures. The resulting increased density makes very large-scale integration (VLSI) more practical. The FPL family has the potential to significantly advance SCE technology. Near-term applications are envisioned in accelerator cores for signal processing and artificial intelligence, with long-term potential in supercomputing applications. The advantages of FPL were demonstrated through an architectural study of a fast Fourier transform (FFT) circuit, comparing it with CMOS and SFQ technologies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04363v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Oxygen in diamond: thermal stability of ST1 spin centres and creation of oxygen-pair complexes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04418</link><description>arXiv:2601.04418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Little is known about oxygen-related defects in diamond. Recently, the promising room-temperature spin centre named ST1 was identified as an oxygen centre, but of still unknown atomic structure and thermal stability. In this work, we report on the optically active oxygen-related centres and the conditions for their formation, using ion implantation of oxygen in various conditions of depth and fluence. More specifically, we establish the temperature formation/stability range of the ST1 centre, which has a maximum at about 1100{\deg}C and is narrower than for NV centres. In these conditions, optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) on small ST1 ensembles was measured with a spin readout contrast of &gt; 20% at 300K. In cathodoluminescence, the 535 nm ST1 peak is not observed. Besides, a broad peak centred at 460 nm is measured for implantation of O$_2$ molecular ions. For an annealing temperature of 1500{\deg}C, a different centre is formed (with ZPL at 584.5 nm) with an intensity increasing with a power law 1.5 &lt; p &lt; 1.9 dependence from the implantation fluence. This suggests that this centre contains two oxygen atoms. Besides, a new spectral feature associated to an intrinsic defect was also observed, with four prominent lines (especially at 594nm). Finally, the thermal formation and stability of oxygen centres in diamond presented here are important for the identification of the atomic structure of defects such as the ST1 and possible O$_2$V$_x$ complex by means of ab initio calculations. Indeed, the formation energies and charge states of defect centres are easier to compute than the full energy level scheme, which to date still remains unsuccessful regarding the ST1 centre.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04418v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] SpectraFormer: an Attention-Based Raman Unmixing Tool for Accessing the Graphene Buffer-Layer Signature on SiC</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04445</link><description>arXiv:2601.04445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Raman spectroscopy is a key tool for graphene characterization, yet its application to graphene grown on silicon carbide (SiC) is strongly limited by the intense and variable second-order Raman response of the substrate. This limitation is critical for buffer layer graphene, a semiconducting interfacial phase, whose vibrational signatures are overlapped with the SiC background and challenging to be reliably accessed using conventional reference-based subtraction, due to strong spatial and experimental variability of the substrate signal. Here we present SpectraFormer, a transformer-based deep learning model that reconstructs the SiC Raman substrate contribution directly from post-growth partially masked spectroscopic data without relying on explicit reference measurements. By learning global correlations across the entire Raman shift range, the model captures the statistical structure of the SiC background and enables accurate reconstruction of its contribution in mixed spectra. Subtraction of the reconstructed substrate signal reveals weak vibrational features associated with ZLG that are inaccessible through conventional analysis methods. The extracted spectra are validated by ab initio vibrational calculations, allowing assignment of the resolved features to specific modes and confirming their physical consistency. By leveraging a state-of-the-art attention-based deep learning architecture, this approach establishes a robust, reference-free framework for Raman analysis of graphene on SiC and provides a foundation, compatible with real-time data acquisition, to its integration into automated, closed-loop AI-assisted growth optimization.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04445v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Scattering of a weakly bound dimer from a hard wall in one dimension</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04662</link><description>arXiv:2601.04662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a dimer formed by two particles with an attractive contact interaction in one dimension, colliding with a hard wall. We compute the scattering phase shifts and the reflection coefficients for various collision energies and various mass ratios of the two particles. For low-energy collisions (with dimer kinetic energies much smaller than the binding energy) our results are consistent with those of D. Lee and M. Pine, The European Physical Journal A 47, 41 (2011). For mass ratios much greater than 1 we use the Born-Oppenheimer approximation to show that the scattering length and the effective range of the dimer-wall collision both depend logarithmically on the mass ratio. For collision energies much greater than the binding energy, the dissociation probability is inversely proportional to the square of the incident momentum of the dimer and we find the constant of proportionality analytically, and we use a semiclassical analysis to approximately derive the ``angular distribution" of the dissociated pair, where the ``angle" $\theta$ depends on the ratio of the velocities of the two outgoing unbound particles.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04662v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Multigap nodeless superconductivity in Dirac semimetal PdTe</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04712</link><description>arXiv:2601.04712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PdTe has recently been reported to be a type-II Dirac semimetal while a bulk nodal and surface nodeless superconductivity (SC) has been claimed to coexist. In this work, we applied point-contact spectroscopy (PCS) method to systematically study the superconducting gap in PdTe single crystals with a SC transition temperature $T_{c}=4.3$ K. The obtained differential conductance curves show a common deviation from a single-gap superconducting behavior and can be better fitted by a two-gap Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model, suggesting the larger gap $\Delta_{L}$ with $2\Delta_{L}$=3.7 $k_{B}T_{c}$ and the smaller gap $\Delta_S$ yielding $2\Delta_{S}$=1.1-2.2 $k_{B}T_{c}$ with a weak interband scattering. The variations of conductance spectra among different contacts are proposed to be caused by the anisotropy of Fermi surface topology associated with different gaps.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04712v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Topological sensing of superfluid rotation using non-Hermitian optical dimers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04749</link><description>arXiv:2601.04749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate a non-Hermitian optical dimer whose parameters are renormalized by dispersive and dissipative backaction from the coupling of the passive cavity with a ring-trapped Bose-Einstein condensate. The passive cavity is driven by a two-tone control laser, where each tone is in a coherent superposition of Laguerre-Gaussian beams carrying orbital angular momenta $\pm \ell \hbar$. This imprints an optical lattice on the ring trap, leading to Bragg-diffracted sidemode excitations. Using an exact Schur-complement reduction of the full light-matter dynamics, we derive a frequency-dependent self-energy and identify a static regime in which the atomic response produces a complex shift of the passive optical mode. This renormalized dimer supports a tunable exceptional point, enabling spectroscopic signatures in the optical transmission due to a probe field, which can in turn be utilized for estimating the winding number of the persistent current. Exploiting the associated half-integer topological charge, we propose a digital exceptional-point-based sensing scheme based on eigenmode permutation, providing a noise-resilient method to sense superfluid rotation without relying on fragile eigenvalue splittings. Importantly, the sensing proposals are intrinsically non-destructive, preserving the coherence of the atomic superfluid.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04749v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Tuning Excitonic Properties and Charge Carrier Dynamics by Halide Alloying in Cs3Bi2(Br1-xIx)9 semiconductors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04771</link><description>arXiv:2601.04771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The perovskite-inspired bismuth halide semiconductor Cs3Bi2Br9 is widely investigated as photoactive material for light-conversion applications. However, charge generation and separation are inherently limited by its modest sunlight absorption and strong exciton binding energy, respectively. Here, we demonstrate that both the light absorption and exciton dissociation are improved by controlled substitution of Br with I via mechanochemical synthesis of Cs3Bi2(Br1-xIx)9. X-ray diffraction and Raman analyses confirm atomic-level halide mixing and reveal a crystallographic phase transition near x = 0.8. From absorption measurements on thin films, we determine the absorption coefficient, Urbach tail, and exciton binding energy for several Cs3Bi2(Br1-xIx)9 compositions. From here, we find that the band gap can be tuned from 2.59 to 1.93 eV (for x = 0.9), while exciton binding energies reach a minimum at x = 0.6. Finally, transient absorption spectroscopy measurements suggest a weak correlation between recombination lifetime and Urbach energy, where the longest lifetimes are observed for the materials with lowest disorder. These results offer valuable insights for designing stable bismuth halide semiconductors with favorable light absorption properties and charge carrier dynamics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04771v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Floquet-driven tunneling control in monolayer MoS$_2$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04837</link><description>arXiv:2601.04837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how fermions in molybdenum disulfide MoS$_2$ interact with a laser field and a static potential barrier, focusing on the transmission probability. Our aim is to understand and control photon-assisted quantum transport in this two-dimensional material under external driving. We use the Floquet approximation to describe the wave functions in the three regions of the system. By applying continuity conditions at the boundaries, we obtain a set of equations involving an infinite number of Floquet modes. We explicitly determine transmissions involving the central band $E$ and the first sidebands $E \pm \hbar\omega$. As for higher-order bands, we use the transfer matrix approach together with current density to compute the associated transmissions. Our results reveal that the transmission probability oscillates for both spin-up and spin-down electrons. The oscillations of spin-down electrons occur over nearly twice the period of spin-up electrons. Among all bands, the central one consistently shows the highest transmission. We also find that stronger laser fields and wider barriers both lead to reduced transmission. Moreover, laser irradiation enables controllable channeling and filtering of transmission bands by tuning the laser intensity and system parameters. This highlights the potential of laser-driven MoS$_2$ structures for highly sensitive electromagnetic sensors and advanced optoelectronic devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04837v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Three-dimensional Moir\'e crystallography</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04971</link><description>arXiv:2601.04971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e materials, typically confined to stacking atomically thin, two - dimensional (2D) layers such as graphene or transition metal dichalcogenides, have transformed our understanding of strongly correlated and topological quantum phenomena. The lattice mismatch and relative twist angle between 2D layers have shown to result in Moir\'e patterns associated with widely tunable electronic properties, ranging from Mott and Chern insulators to semi- and super-conductors. Extended to three-dimensional (3D) structures, Moir\'e materials unlock an entirely new crystallographic space defined by the elements of the 3D rotation group and translational symmetry of the constituent lattices. 3D Moir\'e crystals exhibit fascinating novel properties, often not found in the individual components, yet the general construction principles of 3D Moir\'e crystals remain largely unknown. Here we establish fundamental mathematical principles of 3D Moir\'e crystallography and propose a general method of 3D Moir\'e crystal construction using Clifford algebras over the field of rational numbers. We illustrate several examples of 3D Moir\'e structures representing realistic chemical frameworks and highlight their potential applications in condensed matter physics and solid-state chemistry.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04971v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spin-aligned butterfly spectral map in Non-Hermitian quasicrystals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04986</link><description>arXiv:2601.04986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Non-Hermitian spinful Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) model in the presence of Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) and a spatially varying textured magnetic field is studied. Interestingly, our analysis produces a butterfly spectral map due to the non-trivial extent of localization of the states in the spectrum. This spectral map also exhibits an asymmetric spin alignment with respect to the wings of the butterfly. Our analysis also suggests that the onset of such a spectral map is a combined effect of the non-hermiticity, spin-orbit interaction, and the textured magnetic field.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04986v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Electrically Switchable Flat Band in Two-Dimensional Electron Gases under Nonuniform Magnetic Fields</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05064</link><description>arXiv:2601.05064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat bands are associated with a range of desirable physical phenomena and potential applications, including enhanced superconducting tendencies due to the high density of states, strongly correlated phases such as quantum Hall states. Systems in which flat bands can be switched or tuned are therefore of particular interest. In this study, we analyze the electronic structure of two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) subjected to a linearly increasing magnetic-field dipole together with a transverse electric field, using the operator formalism of the quantum harmonic oscillator. When the electric field magnitude is tuned to a sequence of discrete values, different levels of energy bands are flattened. Moreover, at a specific electric field strength, the ground-state wave function admits an exact closed-form solution that can be understood through the magnetic drifts cancellation in the classical electrodynamics. We also demonstrate two distinct transmission properties, the quantized Hall conductance and the enhanced density of states, of the electrically switchable flat band. These findings establish a new route toward magnetoelectric band engineering and electrically guided transport in low-dimensional systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05064v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Full counting statistics in the sine--Gordon model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05079</link><description>arXiv:2601.05079v1 Announce Type: new

To this end, we extend the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) formulation of the FCS to the sine--Gordon model, emphasise the methodological subtleties for a reliable numerical implementation, and compare numerical results with analytical predictions in certain limits.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05079v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A First-principles Study of Weyl Nodal Loop and Multiple Sets of Weyl Points in Trigonal PtBi$_2$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05123</link><description>arXiv:2601.05123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coexistence of surface superconductivity and Fermi arcs in trigonal $\gamma$-PtBi$_2$ has recently attracted attention for possible realization of topological superconductivity. The Fermi arcs on the two different (0001) surface terminations have been associated with the set of Weyl points just above the Fermi energy (E$_F$). Here using first-principles calculations to explore the band crossings over the full Brillouin zone between the nominally highest valence and lowest conduction bands in $\gamma$-PtBi$_2$, we find a Weyl nodal loop (WNL) and multiple sets of Weyl points (WPs). The main difference between the two reported experimental structural parameters is the magnitude of Bi-layer buckling. While the WNL, bulk gap region and the set of Weyl points just above the E$_F$ are robust, the number and location of the other sets of WPs depend sensitively on the structural parameters with different magnitude of Bi-layer buckling. Besides calculating the 2D Fermi surface with Fermi arcs and quasi-particle interference (QPI) around the E$_F$ in good agreements with ARPES and experimental QPI, we also predict new Fermi arc features at higher energy.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05123v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Acoustic signatures of the field-induced electronic-topological transitions in YbNi$_4$P$_2$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05126</link><description>arXiv:2601.05126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the magnetoelastic properties of an YbNi$_4$P$_2$ single crystal at low temperatures under magnetic fields directed along the crystallographic [001] axis. We report a series of strong anomalies in the sound velocity, which is consistent with the cascade of electronic-topological transitions reported previously for this compound. In particular, we identify the vanishing of a small orbit on the Fermi surface, associated with a quantum-oscillation frequency of 34 T. Furthermore, the different transitions are better resolved with acoustic modes of particular symmetry. Using a microscopic model adapted to the strongly correlated electronic structure of YbNi$_4$P$_2$, we describe our results by inspecting realistic electron-phonon couplings in reciprocal space for each acoustic mode. This shows how the $k$ selectivity of ultrasound experiments allows to investigate Fermi-surface reconstructions in strongly correlated electronic systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05126v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Prediction of Magnetic Topological Materials Combining Spin and Magnetic Space Groups</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05142</link><description>arXiv:2601.05142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scarcity of predicted magnetic topological materials (MTMs) by magnetic space group (MSG) hinders further exploration towards realistic device applications. Here, we propose a new scheme combining spin space groups (SSGs)--approximate symmetry groups neglecting spin-orbit coupling (SOC)--and MSGs to diagnose topology in collinear magnetic materials based on symmetry-indicator theory, enabling a systematic classification of the electronic topology across 484 experimentally synthesized collinear magnets from the MAGNDATA database. This new scheme exploits a symmetry-hierarchy due to SOC induced symmetry-breaking, so that nontrivial band topology can be revealed by SSG, that is yet invisible by the conventional MSG-based method, as exemplified by real triple points in ferromagnetic CaCu$_3$Fe$_2$Sb$_2$O$_{12}$, Dirac nodal lines at generic $k$-points in antiferromagnetic FePSe$_3$ and Weyl nodal lines in altermagnetic Sr$_4$Fe$_4$O$_{11}$. Notably, FePSe$_3$ is topologically trivial under MSG but hosts Dirac nodal lines within the SSG framework. Upon including SOC, these nodal lines are gapped and generate a sizable anomalous Hall conductivity. Despite a vanishing bulk net magnetism, FePSe$_3$ can host topologically protected surface states with large non-relativistic band spin-splitting. Moreover, topology in MTMs is tunable by rotating the magnetic moment direction once SOC is included, as exemplified in Sr$_4$Fe$_4$O$_{11}$.The interplay of topology with non-relativistic and SOC-induced control of properties via magnetic moment reorientation in the predicted MTMs is worthy of further studies in future.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05142v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Local Multimodal Dynamics in Mixed Ionic-Electronic Conductors and Their Fingerprints in Organic Electrochemical Transistor Operation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05179</link><description>arXiv:2601.05179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed ionic-electronic conductors host tightly coupled interactions among mobile ions, electronic charges, and the polymer matrix, giving rise to complex multimodal responses spanning electrical, mechanical, and morphological transformations. These materials underpin organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), which translate such interactions into low-voltage signal amplification and sensing for applications in bioelectronics, neuromorphic computing, and memory. Despite their central role, OECT current-voltage transfer characteristics are often treated phenomenologically, as both the local multimodal dynamics and their connection to global device response remain unresolved. Here, we reveal that the transfer curve encodes a cascade of spatially localized electrochemical transitions, each associated with distinct changes in conductivity, stiffness, and morphology, fundamentally redefining it as a spatially resolved fingerprint of device's internal state. Using automated operando multimodal in-liquid scanning dielectric microscopy, we directly map these dynamics and identify region-specific electrochemical thresholds governing the interplay between source, channel, and drain. We found that the local tip-sample electrostatic force serves as a remarkable mechanistic observable of coupled multimodal dynamics in mixed conductors. A physically grounded model links it to general material, interfacial, and geometric parameters, enabling mechanistic interpretation and predictive insights. Our work provides a new framework for probing and understanding mixed conduction in ion-electron coupled systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05179v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Framing Anomaly in Lattice Chern-Simons-Maxwell Theory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04318</link><description>arXiv:2601.04318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Framing anomaly is a key property of $(2+1)d$ chiral topological orders, for it reveals that the chirality is an intrinsic bulk property of the system, rather than a property of the boundary between two systems. Understanding framing anomaly in lattice models is particularly interesting, as concrete, solvable lattice models of chiral topological orders are rare. In a recent work, we defined and solved the $U(1)$ Chern-Simons-Maxwell theory on spacetime lattice, showing its chiral edge mode and the associated gravitational anomaly on boundary. In this work, we show its framing anomaly in the absence of boundary, by computing the expectation of a lattice version of the modular $T$ operator in the ground subspace on a spatial torus, from which we extract that $\langle T \rangle$ has a universal phase of $-2\pi/12$ as expected: $-2\pi/8$ from the Gauss-Milgram sum of the topological spins of the ground states, and $2\pi/24$ from the framing anomaly; we can also extract the $2\pi/24$ framing anomaly phase alone from the full spectrum of $T$ in the ground subspace by computing $\langle T^m \rangle$. This pins down the last and most crucial property required for a valid lattice definition of $U(1)$ Chern-Simons theory.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04318v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Momentum-Space Entanglement Entropy as a Universal Signature of Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04535</link><description>arXiv:2601.04535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a momentum-space entanglement entropy to quantify quantum correlations between distinct momentum modes following a quench. We prove analytically in the transverse-field Ising (TFI) model and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain that every critical momentum $k^{*}$ associated with a dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) saturates its entanglement entropy to the maximal value $\ln{d}$ ($d=2$ in TFI and SSH models), coinciding with the vanishing of the Loschmidt echo. This saturation of mode entanglement thus provides a universal, direct signature of DQPTs. Our work thus establishes a unified, entanglement-based perspective on dynamical quantum phase transitions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04535v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Unconventional superconductivity mediated by exciton density wave fluctuations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09148</link><description>arXiv:2410.09148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic platforms afford an unparalleled degree of controllability in realizing strongly-correlated phases of matter. In this work, we study the possibility of electrically tunable exciton-mediated superconductivity arising in charge-imbalanced bilayer semiconductors. Focusing on the case of a bilayer semiconductor heterostructure, we identify the gating conditions required to achieve exciton density wave order within a self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation. We analyze the role of the coupling of excitonic fluctuations to the fermionic charge carriers to find that the Goldstone mode of the density wave order can mediate attractive interactions leading to superconductivity. Furthermore, when the system is close to the density wave ordering, the interactions mediated by low-energy exciton modes can support an interlayer pair-density wave superconductor of anisotropic character. We discuss experimental signatures associated with these phenomena.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.09148v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Magnetization-Tunable Topological Phase Transitions in Ferromagnetic Kagome Monolayers of Co$_3$X$_3$Y$_2$ ($X=\mathrm{Sn},\mathrm{Pb}$; $Y=\mathrm{S},\mathrm{Se}$)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06686</link><description>arXiv:2502.06686v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect in magnetic kagome materials has emerged as a versatile platform for dissipationless electronic and spintronic devices. In this work, we demonstrate that the orientation of magnetic moments $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$ at lattice sites provides a practical tuning mechanism for engineering nontrivial topological phases in monolayer kagome ferromagnets. To elucidate the mechanism, we construct a symmetry-adapted minimal tight-binding model for kagome ferromagnets that includes intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and the intrinsic Rashba SOC permitted by broken out-of-plane mirror symmetry between nearest-neighbor kagome sites and can capture the resulting topological phase diagram as a function of $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$. In particular, the restoration of in-plane mirror symmetry for specific values of $\phi$ drives a topological phase transition upon varying the in-plane orientation of the moments $\hat{m}(\theta = 90^{\circ}, \phi)$. In contrast, for fixed $\phi$, the transitions driven by varying $\theta$ originate from the competition between Rashba SOC and intrinsic SOC. Density functional theory calculations for ferromagnetic kagome monolayers belonging to the Co$_3$X$_3$Y$_2$ family ($X=\mathrm{Sn},\mathrm{Pb}$; $Y=\mathrm{S},\mathrm{Se}$) support the predictions of the proposed minimal tight-binding model. These findings provide design guidelines for tunable topological phases in kagome materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.06686v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Characterizing the cage state of glassy systems and its sensitivity to frozen boundaries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16339</link><description>arXiv:2507.16339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the role that structure plays in the dynamical arrest observed in glassy systems remains an open challenge. Over the last decade, machine learning (ML) strategies have emerged as an important tool for probing this structure-dynamics relationship, particularly for predicting heterogeneous glassy dynamics from local structure. A recent advancement is the introduction of the cage state, a structural quantity that captures the average positions of particles while rearrangements are forbidden. During the caging regime, linear models trained on the cage state have been shown to outperform more complex ML methods trained on initial configurations only. In this paper, we explore the properties associated with the cage state in more detail to better understand why it serves as such an effective predictor for the dynamics. Specifically, we examine how the cage state in a binary hard-sphere mixture is influenced by both packing fraction and boundary conditions. Our results reveal that, as the system approaches the glassy regime, the cage state becomes increasingly influenced by long-range structural effects. This influence is evident both in its predictive power for particle dynamics and in the internal structure of the cage state, suggesting that the CS might be associated with some form of an amorphous growing structural length scale.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.16339v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Predictive models for strain energy in condensed phase reactions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15592</link><description>arXiv:2508.15592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular modeling of thermally activated chemistry in condensed phases is essential to understand polymerization, depolymerization, and other processing steps of molecular materials. Current methods typically combine molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to describe short-time relaxation with a stochastic description of predetermined chemical reactions. Possible reactions are often selected on the basis of geometric criteria, such as a capture distance between reactive atoms. Although these simulations have provided valuable insight, the approximations used to determine possible reactions often lead to significant molecular strain and unrealistic structures. We show that the local molecular environment surrounding the reactive site plays a crucial role in determining the resulting molecular strain energy and, in turn, the associated reaction rates. We develop a graph neural network capable of predicting the strain energy associated with a cyclization reaction from the pre-reaction, local, molecular environment surrounding the reactive site. The model is trained on a large dataset of condensed-phase reactions during the activation of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) obtained from MD simulations and can be used to adjust relative reaction rates in condensed systems and advance our understanding of thermally activated chemical processes in complex materials</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.15592v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Thickness dependent rare earth segregation in magnetron deposited NdCo$_{4.6}$ thin films studied by Xray reflectivity and Hard Xray photoemission</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23852</link><description>arXiv:2510.23852v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic anisotropy in disordered rare-earth-transition metals (RE-TM) compounds arises from RE atoms occupying asymmetric environments within the TM lattice. However, the underlying mechanism that promotes such environments remains not fully understood. In this study, we investigate amorphous NdCo$_{4.6}$ thin films deposited by magnetron sputtering, where the magnetic anisotropy evolves with thickness from in-plane to out-of-plane orientation above 40 nm. X-ray reflectivity measurements revealed the progressive formation of an additional layer between the 3 nm Si capping layer and the NdCo film with increasing film thickness. To probe the composition and distribution of Co and Nd near the surface, Hard X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy (HAXPES) was performed on films ranging from 5 nm to 65 nm in thickness using incident photon energies of 7, 19, and 13 keV. These correspond to inelastic electron mean free paths of 7.2-12.3 nm in cobalt. The cobalt atomic concentration, deduced from HAXPES at the Nd 3d and Co 2p excitations, was consistently below the nominal value and varied with both thickness and photon energy. This indicates segregation of RE atoms at the film surface, which becomes more pronounced with increasing thickness. Background analysis of the Co 2p and Nd 3d peaks supports this conclusion. The thickness of the Nd segregated layer is estimated in 2-3 nm. These findings demonstrate that incorporating neodymium into the cobalt lattice incurs an energy cost which is associated with strain due to the volume mismatch between the two elements. Reducing this strain energy promotes anisotropic atomic environments for Nd, thereby explaining the emergence of perpendicular anisotropy and its dependence on film thickness in these RE-TM compounds.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.23852v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interaction-Induced Quasicrystalline Order: Emergence of Quasi-Solid and Quasi-Supersolid Phases</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02218</link><description>arXiv:2511.02218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deterministic quasiperiodicity in quantum systems has long been associated with localization, criticality, or glassy behavior, and has therefore been believed to suppress long-range order rather than stabilize it. Here we demonstrate the opposite: quasiperiodicity in interactions--without any quasiperiodic potential, disorder, or geometric modulation--can generate coherent, ordered quantum phases. We study hard-core bosons in one dimension with quasiperiodic long-range interactions, V_{ij}=V_0 \cos(\pi \alpha i)\cos(\pi \alpha j), where n=\alpha=(\sqrt{5}-1)/2 is the inverse golden ratio. Using large-scale path-integral quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover thermodynamically stable incompressible plateaus at irrational densities tied to Fibonacci ratios. These plateaus exhibit sharp incommensurate Bragg peaks, signaling an emergent quasi-solid with long-range quasicrystalline density order. More strikingly, at nearby fillings and interaction strengths, we identify a quasi-supersolid phase that supports both Fibonacci density ordering and finite superfluid density--demonstrating that interaction-induced quasiperiodicity can stabilize supersolid coherence. Our results establish a new mechanism for realizing ordered quasicrystalline quantum matter, and provide realistic guidance for implementation in Rydberg atom arrays, multimode cavity-QED systems, and trapped-ion quantum simulators.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.02218v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Hybrid Disclination Skin-topological Effects in Non-Hermitian Circuits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02862</link><description>arXiv:2601.02862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bulk-disclination correspondence (BDC) is a fundamental concept in Hermitian systems that has been widely applied to predict disclination states. Recently, disclination states have also been observed and experimentally verified in non-Hermitian systems with C6 lattice symmetry, where gain and loss are introduced to induce non-Hermiticity. In this Letter, we propose a non-Hermitian two-dimensional (2D) Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) disclination model with skin-topological (ST) disclination states, and calculate its biorthogonal Zak phase. Together with the real-space disclination index, we predict the emergence of disclination states in a C4-symmetric non-Hermitian lattice and the corresponding fractional charge. We also generalize the symmetry indicator within the biorthogonal framework to predict the anomalous filling near the disclination core. Experimentally, the model is implemented on a nonreciprocal circuit platform, where we analyze the impedance matrix characterized by complex eigenfrequencies and directly observe the ST disclination states. Our work further extends the bulk-disclination correspondence to the non-Hermitian realm.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02862v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Redundancy Channels in the Conformal Bootstrap</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05338</link><description>arXiv:2507.05338v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A method for obstructing symmetry enhancement in numerical conformal bootstrap calculations is proposed. Symmetry enhancement refers to situations where bootstrap studies initialised with a certain symmetry end up allowing theories with higher symmetry. In such cases, it is shown that redundant operators in the less symmetric theory can descend from primary scaling operators of the more symmetric one, motivating the imposition of spectral gaps that are justified in the former but not the latter. The same mechanism can also be used to differentiate between decoupled and fully coupled theories which otherwise have the same global symmetry. A systematic understanding of this mechanism is developed and applied to distinguish the cubic from the $O(3)$ model in three dimensions, where a strip of disallowed parameter space, referred to as the cubic redundancy channel, emerges once a gap associated with a redundant operator of the cubic theory is imposed. The channel corresponds precisely to the region of parameter space where the assumed cubic symmetry would be enhanced to $O(3)$.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.05338v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The Thermodynamics of the Gravity from Entropy Theory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22545</link><description>arXiv:2510.22545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gravity from Entropy (GfE) action posits that the fundamental nature of gravity is information encoded in the metric degrees of freedom. This statistical mechanics theory is associated with the GfE Lagrangian given by the Geometric Quantum Relative Entropy (GQRE) between the true metric and the metric induced by the matter fields and the curvature. The GfE action leads to the GfE modified gravity equations displaying an emergent dynamical cosmological constant. Interestingly, the GfE equations of motion reduce to the Einstein equations in the limit of low energy and small curvature. Here we embrace a thermodynamic point of view and we associate the energy density of the GfE to the emergent dynamical cosmological constant of the theory. Focusing on homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes, we reveal that the GfE universes associated with the FRW metrics are thermal. Indeed they are associated with the $k$-temperatures and the $k$-pressures which are related to their local GQRE and their local energy by the first law of GfE thermodynamics. The thermodynamics of the GfE theory is illustrated in the low energy, small curvature limit with matter content modelled as perfect fluid, where the solutions of the GfE equations of motion are well approximated by the Friedmann universes. We show that while the total GQRE per unit volume is not increasing, coherently with its relative entropy nature, the total entropy of GfE universes is not decreasing in time. These results provide a natural thermodynamic interpretation of GfE cosmologies and a framework for reconciling local complexity with the global increase in entropy of the universe.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.22545v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Memory-Guided Unified Hardware Accelerator for Mixed-Precision Scientific Computing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04476</link><description>arXiv:2601.04476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent hardware acceleration advances have enabled powerful specialized accelerators for finite element computations, spiking neural network inference, and sparse tensor operations. However, existing approaches face fundamental limitations: (1) finite element methods lack comprehensive rounding error analysis for reduced-precision implementations and use fixed precision assignment strategies that cannot adapt to varying numerical conditioning; (2) spiking neural network accelerators cannot handle non-spike operations and suffer from bit-width escalation as network depth increases; and (3) FPGA tensor accelerators optimize only for dense computations while requiring manual configuration for each sparsity pattern. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{Memory-Guided Unified Hardware Accelerator for Mixed-Precision Scientific Computing}, a novel framework that integrates three enhanced modules with memory-guided adaptation for efficient mixed-workload processing on unified platforms. Our approach employs memory-guided precision selection to overcome fixed precision limitations, integrates experience-driven bit-width management and dynamic parallelism adaptation for enhanced spiking neural network acceleration, and introduces curriculum learning for automatic sparsity pattern discovery. Extensive experiments on FEniCS, COMSOL, ANSYS benchmarks, MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, DVS-Gesture datasets, and COCO 2017 demonstrate 2.8\% improvement in numerical accuracy, 47\% throughput increase, 34\% energy reduction, and 45-65\% throughput improvement compared to specialized accelerators. Our work enables unified processing of finite element methods, spiking neural networks, and sparse computations on a single platform while eliminating data transfer overhead between separate units.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04476v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] MPM-LLM4DSE: Reaching the Pareto Frontier in HLS with Multimodal Learning and LLM-Driven Exploration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04801</link><description>arXiv:2601.04801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-Level Synthesis (HLS) design space exploration (DSE) seeks Pareto-optimal designs within expansive pragma configuration spaces. To accelerate HLS DSE, graph neural networks (GNNs) are commonly employed as surrogates for HLS tools to predict quality of results (QoR) metrics, while multi-objective optimization algorithms expedite the exploration. However, GNN-based prediction methods may not fully capture the rich semantic features inherent in behavioral descriptions, and conventional multi-objective optimization algorithms often do not explicitly account for the domain-specific knowledge regarding how pragma directives influence QoR. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the MPM-LLM4DSE framework, which incorporates a multimodal prediction model (MPM) that simultaneously fuses features from behavioral descriptions and control and data flow graphs. Furthermore, the framework employs a large language model (LLM) as an optimizer, accompanied by a tailored prompt engineering methodology. This methodology incorporates pragma impact analysis on QoR to guide the LLM in generating high-quality configurations (LLM4DSE). Experimental results demonstrate that our multimodal predictive model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art work ProgSG by up to 10.25$\times$. Furthermore, in DSE tasks, the proposed LLM4DSE achieves an average performance gain of 39.90\% over prior methods, validating the effectiveness of our prompting methodology.

Targeted α‑radiopharmaceutical therapy (TAT) provides a promising solution, offering potent localized cytotoxicity, reduced recurrence, and minimal acquired resistance. Mouse Double Minute 2 (MDM2), often amplification in osteosarcoma, serving as an ideal TAT target. Here, we present a TAT strategy that leverages the cell nucleus-enrichment capability of a 225Ac-labeled, MDM2-targeting stapled peptide for effective treatment of osteosarcoma. Rapid PET/CT-based screening enables precise identification of an optimized MDM2-targeting stapled peptide ligand (tumor uptake: 8.26 %ID/g; nucleus uptake fraction: 18.9 %). A single micro-dose (17 KBq) markedly suppressed osteosarcoma growth with satisfactory safety, resulting in growth arrest in over 50% of tumors without signs of recurrence. Mechanistically, the 225Ac-labeled stapled peptide rapidly triggers cellular stress programs in osteosarcoma and progressively induces the formation of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Our findings suggest that TAT represents an effective therapeutic strategy for osteosarcoma, with MDM2-targeting stapled peptide serving as an ideal ligand for this approach.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-7hg79?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Association-gated multiphoton activation of inert haloarenes via sequential electron donor–acceptor assembly</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-1386d-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The functionalization of recalcitrant chemical bonds that require extreme reduction potentials is often thwarted by the absence of a defined reaction field to control potent intermediates. Conventional multiphoton photocatalysis generates super-reductants, whose immense energy dissipates through chaotic, diffusion-controlled pathways. Herein, an "association-gated" strategy is introduced that constructs sequential electron donor–acceptor (EDA) complexes as programmable reaction microenvironments. This system initially captures a single photon through its sulfide/naphthalene monoimide (NMI) complex. The resulting NMI radical anion serves as a scaffold to pre-organize the haloarene substrate into a second, distinct EDA complex, creating a reaction pocket for the final, energy-storing excitation. Such supramolecular confinement generates an extreme reducing potential at the carbon–halogen bond, suppressing both diffusive side-reactions and parasitic hydrogen atom transfer from amine donors. This unlocks a broad scope of transformations under air-tolerant conditions, providing a versatile tool for late-stage diversification.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-1386d-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Chemical Engineering] Transient pH changes drive vacuole formation in enzyme–polymer condensates</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s44286-025-00322-7</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Chemical Engineering, Published online: 09 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44286-025-00322-7"&gt;doi:10.1038/s44286-025-00322-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Rapid pH changes can trigger hollow vacuoles in associative condensates of pH-responsive biomolecules.

Anxiety and related issues are major health and social concerns in developed countries, affecting 10–20% of the population. The lowest effective inhibitory concentrations for GABA-AT were observed for two compounds: 3h (30.50±0.61 µM) and 3r (44.76±0.49 µM). Their IC50 values were similar to those of lamotrigine. In vitro tests showed that compounds 3h and 3f had the lowest IC50 values for GABA-AT inhibition, at 30.50±0.61 and 44.58±0.54, respectively. The anticonvulsant activity of 6-(4-methoxybenzyl)-3-R-4H-[1,2,4] triazin-5-ones in a corral seizure model depends on modifications to substituents at positions three and six of the heterocyclic 1,2,4-triazine ring. Leading compounds, 3f (3-(4-Chlorophenylamino)-6-(4-methoxybenzyl)-4H-[1,2,4]triazin-5-one) and 3h (3-(2,3-Dimethylphenylamino)-6-(4-methoxybenzyl)-4H-[1,2,4]triazin-5-one), completely inhibit clonic and tonic-clonic seizures. Compound 3r, which contains both tryptamine and triazine fragments, has a clear pharmacophore structure. However, the spatial structure of the pharmacophore in compound 3h, with the lowest binding energy to GABAa and GABA-AT and the best performance in tests, is not yet fully understood.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-4b2m1?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] DNA-Encoded Nanoparticle Interfaces Accelerate Diverse Enzymes Through Noncovalent Association</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-hrvzp?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Enhancing enzyme performance without protein engineering remains a central challenge in biocatalysis. Here, we report the unusual discovery that nanoparticles densely functionalized with DNA can bind enzymes without chemical conjugation, affinity tags, or engineered recognition motifs, and substantially increase catalytic activity. This effect generalizes across multiple enzyme classes: cytochrome c and catalase exhibit ~9.4-fold and ~3.0-fold higher peroxidase activity, while carbonic anhydrase shows a ~1.6-fold increased esterase activity, underscoring the versatility of this system. Mechanistic studies indicate that enhancement is an emergent property of the three-dimensional, high-density DNA shell, with the core functioning primarily as a scaffold. Activity modulation is governed not only by DNA density and length, but also, critically, by DNA sequence, establishing sequence design as a programmable handle for tuning enzyme output. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations reveal that base-specific interactions reshape enzyme conformational flexibility and increase active-site accessibility. We further show sequence-encoded control in multienzyme systems through a DNA-programmed cascade where DNA-functionalized glucose oxidase recruits cytochrome c at the DNA interface, yielding &gt;4.8-fold higher cascade efficiency than free-enzyme mixtures. Together, these findings position DNA-functionalized nanoparticles as adaptable, sequence-programmable platforms for improving and coordinating biocatalysis, opening new routes for enzyme control in synthesis, diagnostics, and therapeutic design.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-hrvzp?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Abstract: Predicting the melting temperature (Tm) of multi-component and high-entropy alloys (HEAs) is critical for high-temperature applications but computationally expensive using traditional CALPHAD or DFT methods. In this work, we develop a gradient-boosted decision tree (XGBoost) model to predict Tm for complex alloys based on elemental properties. To ensure physical consistency, we address the issue of data leakage by excluding temperature-dependent thermodynamic descriptors (such as Gibbs free energy of mixing) and instead rely on physically motivated elemental features. The optimized model achieves a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.948 and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 9928 which is about 5% relative error for HEAs on a validation set of approximately 1300 compositions. Crucially, we validate the model using the Valence Electron Concentration (VEC) rule. Without explicit constraints during training, the model successfully captures the known stability transition between BCC and FCC phases at a VEC of approximately 6.87. These results demonstrate that data-driven models, when properly feature-engineered, can capture fundamental metallurgical principles for rapid alloy screening.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03801v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Material exploration through active learning -- METAL</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03933</link><description>arXiv:2601.03933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery and design of new materials are paramount in the development of green technologies. High entropy oxides represent one such group that has only been tentatively explored, mainly due to the inherent problem of navigating vast compositional spaces. Thanks to the emergence of machine learning, however, suitable tools are now readily available. Here, the task of finding oxygen carriers for chemical looping processes has been tackled by leveraging active learning-based strategies combined with first-principles calculations. High efficiency and efficacy have, moreover, been achieved by exploiting the power of recently developed machine learning interatomic potentials. Firstly, the proposed approaches were validated based on an established computational framework for identifying high entropy perovskites that can be used in chemical looping air separation and dry reforming. Chief among the insights thus gained was the identification of the best performing strategies, in the form of greedy or Thompson-based sampling based on uncertainty estimates obtained from Gaussian processes. Building on this newfound knowledge, the concept was applied to a more complex problem, namely the discovery of high entropy oxygen carriers for chemical looping oxygen uncoupling. This resulted in both qualitative as well as quantitative outcomes, including lists of specific materials with high oxygen transfer capacities and configurational entropies. Specifically, the best candidates were based on the known oxygen carrier CaMnO3 but also contained a variety of additional species, of which some, e.g., Ti; Co; Cu; and Ti, were expected while others were not, e.g., Y and Sm. The results suggest that adopting active learning approaches is critical in materials discovery, given that these methods are already shifting research practice and soon will be the norm.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03933v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Transport properties in a model of confined granular mixtures at moderate densities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04026</link><description>arXiv:2601.04026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work derives the Navier--Stokes hydrodynamic equations for a model of a confined, quasi-two-dimensional, $s$-component mixture of inelastic, smooth, hard spheres. Using the inelastic version of the revised Enskog theory, macroscopic balance equations for mass, momentum, and energy are obtained, and constitutive equations for the fluxes are determined through a first-order Chapman--Enskog expansion. As for elastic collisions, the transport coefficients are given in terms of the solutions of a set of coupled linear integral equations. Approximate solutions to these equations for diffusion transport coefficients and shear viscosity are achieved by assuming steady-state conditions and considering leading terms in a Sonine polynomial expansion. These transport coefficients are expressed in terms of the coefficients of restitution, concentration, the masses and diameters of the mixture's components, and the system's density. The results apply to moderate densities and are not limited to particular values of the coefficients of restitution, concentration, mass, and/or diameter ratios. As an application, the thermal diffusion factor is evaluated to analyze segregation driven by temperature gradients and gravity, providing criteria that distinguish whether larger particles accumulate near the hotter or colder boundaries.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04026v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] libMobility: A Python library for hydrodynamics at the Smoluchowski level</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02135</link><description>arXiv:2510.02135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective hydrodynamic modeling is crucial for accurately predicting fluid-particle interactions in diverse fields such as biophysics and materials science. Developing and implementing hydrodynamic algorithms is challenging due to the complexity of fluid dynamics, necessitating efficient management of large-scale computations and sophisticated boundary conditions. Furthermore, adapting these algorithms for use on massively parallel architectures like GPUs adds an additional layer of complexity. This paper presents the libMobility software library, which offers a suite of CUDA-enabled solvers for simulating hydrodynamic interactions in particulate systems at the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa (RPY) level. The library facilitates precise simulations of particle displacements influenced by external forces and torques, including both the deterministic and stochastic components. Notable features of libMobility include its ability to handle linear and angular displacements, thermal fluctuations, and various domain geometries effectively. With an interface in Python, libMobility provides comprehensive tools for researchers in computational fluid dynamics and related fields to simulate particle mobility efficiently. This article details the technical architecture, functionality, and wide-ranging applications of libMobility. libMobility is available at https://github.com/stochasticHydroTools/libMobility.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.02135v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Kinetic Flux Equations for Ion Exchange in Silicate Glasses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03207</link><description>arXiv:2601.03207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ion exchange kinetic flux equations have been extensively investigated since the mid-twentieth century and continue to provide a fundamental framework for describing mass transport phenomena in solid materials. Despite the maturity of this field, inconsistencies remain in the literature concerning the definition, dimensional consistency, and physical interpretation of the parameters involved. A rigorous and unified treatment of these equations is therefore essential to ensure the reproducibility and comparability of theoretical and experimental studies. The present study aims to establish a coherent and systematic development of ion exchange kinetic flux equations, with particular emphasis on the consistent definition and dimensional formulation of the relevant physical quantities. Beyond refining the theoretical foundations, this study extends the classical formulation by incorporating the influence of mechanical stress on ion transport and considering cross-term interactions within the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics. These developments provide a more comprehensive description of ion exchange kinetics, particularly as applied to silicate glasses, where coupling between chemical and mechanical effects plays a crucial role in determining transport behavior and performance.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03207v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Agentic Exploration of Physics Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24978</link><description>arXiv:2509.24978v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations, analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an open challenge to fully automate the heuristic, iterative loop required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large language model tool-use capabilities to enable exploration of systems without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution, and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains, without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.24978v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Masgent: An AI-assisted Materials Simulation Agent</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23010</link><description>arXiv:2512.23010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning potentials (MLPs) are essential for predicting and understanding materials properties, yet preparing, executing, and analyzing these simulations typically requires extensive scripting, multi-step procedures, and significant high-performance computing (HPC) expertise. These challenges hinder reproducibility and slow down discovery. Here, we introduce Masgent, an AI-assisted materials simulation agent that unifies structure manipulation, automated VASP input generation, DFT workflow construction and analysis, fast MLP-based simulations, and lightweight machine learning (ML) utilities within a single platform. Powered by large language models (LLMs), Masgent enables researchers to perform complex simulation tasks through natural-language interaction, eliminating most manual scripting and reducing setup time from hours to seconds. By standardizing protocols and integrating advanced simulation and data-driven tools, Masgent lowers the barrier to performing state-of-the-art computational methodologies, enabling faster hypothesis testing, pre-screening, and exploratory research for both new and experienced practitioners.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23010v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interlayer Charge-Transfer Ferroelectric Fluctuations as a Pairing Mechanism in van der Waals Superconductors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03352</link><description>arXiv:2601.03352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signatures of unconventional superconductivity have been reported in a wide range of van der Waals (vdW) materials. However, their microscopic origin remains unclear due to competing electronic orders, strong spin-orbit coupling, and structural instabilities in the normal state. Here we investigate the role of interlayer breathing and shear modes in superconducting vdW heterostructures. Contrary to conventional wisdom -- which assumes that weak interlayer bonding and large layer separation suppress electronic coupling to these modes -- we show that the associated charge transfer can generate a substantial pairing interaction. We develop a theory of superconductivity mediated by such interlayer modes and demonstrate that proximity to a ferroelectric or antiferroelectric quantum critical point provides a strong-coupling pairing channel. Within a two-dimensional model with SU(2) symmetry and in-plane isotropy, we find an accidental degeneracy between interlayer triplet states, which can occur even for an $s$-wave in-plane gap. We further show that Josephson coupling between layers, arising from either static magnetism or induced by paramagnetic correlations, can stabilize a time-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconducting state of the $s+i\,s$ type, which couples to magnetization when at least two mirror symmetries are absent. Our results are directly applicable to candidate chiral vdW superconductors such as 4Hb-TaS$_2$ and to sliding ferroelectric metals, exemplified by bilayer MoTe$_2$. More broadly, our work identifies ferroelectric fluctuations as a promising route to unconventional pairing in vdW systems and motivates experimental searches for chiral multicomponent superconductivity.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03352v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The Zubarev Double Time Greens function-A Vintage Many Body Technique</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03439</link><description>arXiv:2601.03439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lecture notes present a comprehensive and powerful many-body technique pioneered in 1960 by D. N. Zubarev. The technique, known as the Zubarev Double Time Greens Function method, was used extensively by leading solid state physicists such as John Hubbard and Laura Roth in the 1960s. We present the technique and apply it to the non-interacting electron and boson gas. We next consider the (many-body) Hubbard model and show how it yields the Stoner criterion for ferromagnetism. It is easily extendable to superconductivity and related problems. Our treatment is pedagogical and understandable to those with just an elementary understanding of second quantization.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03439v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interplay of activity and non-reciprocity in tracer dynamics: From non-equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation to giant diffusion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03591</link><description>arXiv:2601.03591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal interactions play a key role in shaping transport in active and passive systems, giving rise to striking nonequilibrium behavior. Here, we study the dynamics of a tracer -- active or passive -- embedded in a bath of active or passive particles, coupled through non-reciprocal interactions. Starting from the microscopic stochastic dynamics of the full system, we derive an overdamped generalized Langevin equation for the tracer, incorporating a non-Markovian memory kernel that captures bath-mediated correlations. This framework enables us to compute the tracer's velocity and displacement response, derive a generalized nonequilibrium fluctuation-dissipation relation that quantifies deviations from equilibrium behavior, and determine the mean-squared displacement (MSD). We find that while the MSD becomes asymptotically diffusive, the effective diffusivity depends non-monotonically on the degree of non-reciprocity and diverges at an intermediate value. This regime of giant diffusivity provides a generic mechanism for enhanced transport in active soft matter and has direct implications for biological systems exhibiting chase-and-run or predator-prey interactions. Our analytical predictions are supported by numerical simulations of active Brownian particles, highlighting experimentally accessible signatures of non-reciprocal interactions in soft matter.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03591v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interference-Induced Suppression of Doublon Transport and Prethermalization in the Extended Bose-Hubbard Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03694</link><description>arXiv:2601.03694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherent mobility of doublons, arising from second-order virtual dissociation-recombination processes, fundamentally limits their use as information carriers in the strongly interacting Bose-Hubbard model. We propose a disorder-free suppression mechanism by introducing an optimized nearest-neighbor pair-hopping term that destructively interferes with the dominant virtual hopping channel. Using the third-order Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we derive an analytical optimal condition that accounts for lattice geometry corrections. Exact numerical simulations demonstrate that this optimized scheme achieves near-complete dynamical arrest and entanglement preservation in one-dimensional chains, while in two-dimensional square lattices, it significantly suppresses ballistic spreading yet permits a slow residual expansion. Furthermore, in the many-body regime, finite-size scaling analysis identifies the observed long-lived density-wave order as a prethermal plateau emerging from the dramatic separation of microscopic and thermalization timescales.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03694v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Equivariant Neural Networks for Force-Field Models of Lattice Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04104</link><description>arXiv:2601.04104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learning (ML) force fields enable large-scale simulations with near-first-principles accuracy at substantially reduced computational cost. Recent work has extended ML force-field approaches to adiabatic dynamical simulations of condensed-matter lattice models with coupled electronic and structural or magnetic degrees of freedom. However, most existing formulations rely on hand-crafted, symmetry-aware descriptors, whose construction is often system-specific and can hinder generality and transferability across different lattice Hamiltonians. Here we introduce a symmetry-preserving framework based on equivariant neural networks (ENNs) that provides a general, data-driven mapping from local configurations of dynamical variables to the associated on-site forces in a lattice Hamiltonian. In contrast to ENN architectures developed for molecular systems -- where continuous Euclidean symmetries dominate -- our approach aims to embed the discrete point-group and internal symmetries intrinsic to lattice models directly into the neural-network representation of the force field. As a proof of principle, we construct an ENN-based force-field model for the adiabatic dynamics of the Holstein Hamiltonian on a square lattice, a canonical system for electron-lattice physics. The resulting ML-enabled large-scale dynamical simulations faithfully capture mesoscale evolution of the symmetry-breaking phase, illustrating the utility of lattice-equivariant architectures for linking microscopic electronic processes to emergent dynamical behavior in condensed-matter lattice systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04104v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Physics-Informed Gaussian Process Regression for the Constitutive Modeling of Concrete: A Data-Driven Improvement to Phenomenological Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03367</link><description>arXiv:2601.03367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and modeling the constitutive behavior of concrete is crucial for civil and defense applications, yet widely used phenomenological models such as Karagozian \&amp; Case concrete (KCC) model depend on empirically calibrated failure surfaces that lack flexibility in model form and associated uncertainty quantification. This work develops a physics-informed framework that retains the modular elastoplastic structure of KCC model while replacing its empirical failure surface with a constrained Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) surrogate that can be learned directly from experimentally accessible observables. Triaxial compression data under varying confinement levels are used for training, and the surrogate is then evaluated at confinement levels not included in the training set to assess its generalization capability. Results show that an unconstrained GPR interpolates well near training conditions but deteriorates and violates essential physical constraints under extrapolation, even when augmented with simulated data. In contrast, a physics-informed GPR that incorporates derivative-based constraints aligned with known material behavior yields markedly better accuracy and reliability, including at higher confinement levels beyond the training range. Probabilistic enforcement of these constraints also reduces predictive variance, producing tighter confidence intervals in data-scarce regimes. Overall, the proposed approach delivers a robust, uncertainty-aware surrogate that improves generalization and streamlines calibration without sacrificing the interpretability and numerical efficiency of the KCC model, offering a practical path toward an improved constitutive models for concrete.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03367v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interfacial Line Energy of a Topological Phase</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11102</link><description>arXiv:2408.11102v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In interacting topological systems, Landau-like order parameters interplay with the band topology of fermions. The physics of domain formation in such systems can get significantly altered due to the presence of topological fermions. In this work we show that coupling a topological fermionic field to a scalar field can drastically modify the nucleation processes. We find that existence of non-trivial fermionic boundary modes on the nucleating droplets of the scalar field leads to substantial quantum corrections to the interface energy. This leads to an increase in the size of the critical nucleus beyond which unrestricted droplet growth happens. To illustrate the phenomena we devise a minimal model of fermions in a Chern insulating system coupled to a classical Ising field in two spatial dimensions. Using a combination of analytic and numerical methods we conclusively demonstrate that topological phases have a characteristic quantum correction to the interfacial line energy. Apart from material systems, our work opens up a host of questions regarding the impact of fermionic topological terms on classical phase transitions and associated criticality.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2408.11102v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Effective spin model with anisotropic exchange interactions for the spin-orbit coupled Hubbard model at half-filling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05166</link><description>arXiv:2504.05166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in noncentrosymmetric materials is the source of incommensurate magnetic structures. In semiconductors, it drives the Rashba spin splitting and spin momentum locking, while in magnetic insulators based on transition metals, it induces anisotropic spin exchange interactions, like the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction which drives chiral magnetism and skyrmion formation. Here, we establish a direct connection between SOC and spin exchange interactions by deriving an effective spin model from the SOC Hubbard model at half-filling. Using a strong-coupling expansion up to fourth order by including the full set of terms, we identify Heisenberg, Ising-like, and ring exchange interactions, as well as a variety of four-body terms for realistic Hubbard parameters, which impose strong constraints on the relative strengths of the spin interactions. Our spin model shows excellent agreement in energy with the SOC Hubbard model down $U/t \sim 5$ near the metal-insulator transition point, providing insight to which kind of magnetic interactions relevant across this regime are responsible for the emergence of complex magnetic textures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.05166v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Magneto-optical Kerr effect in an A-type antiferromagnet</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16167</link><description>arXiv:2504.16167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) is a powerful probe of broken time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{T}$), typically used to study ferromagnets. While MOKE has been observed in some antiferromagnets (AFMs) with vanishing magnetization, it is often associated with structures whose symmetry is lower than basic collinear, bipartite order. In contrast, theory predicts a mechanism for MOKE intrinsic to all AFMs of A-type, i.e. layered AFMs in which ferromagnetic layers are antiferromagnetically aligned. Here we report the first experimental confirmation of this mechanism in a bulk AFM. We achieve this by measuring the imaginary component of MOKE as a function of photon energy in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, an A-type AFM where $\mathcal{T}$ is preserved in combination with a translation. By comparing the experimental results with model calculations, we demonstrate that observable MOKE should be expected in all collinear A-type AFMs with out-of-plane spin order, thus enabling optical detection of AFM domains and expanding the scope of MOKE to few-layer AFMs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.16167v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Chiral anomaly-induced nonlinear Hall effect in spin-orbit coupled noncentrosymmetric metals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00821</link><description>arXiv:2508.00821v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that chiral anomaly is not limited to Weyl semimetals (WSMs), but are also shown by a larger class of materials called spin orbit coupled noncentrosymmetric metals (SOC-NCMs),which has shed more insight into the origin of chiral anomaly as a Fermi surface property rather than a nodal property. In this study, we explore nonlinear transport responses in SOC-NCMswithin the framework of semiclassical dynamics, employing the Maxwell-Boltzmann transport theory augmented by charge conservation and momentum-dependent scattering processes. We take into account both non-magnetic and magnetic impurity scattering mechanisms. We demonstrate that the chiral-anomaly-induced nonlinear Hall (CNLH) response exhibits a characteristic quadratic dependence on the applied magnetic field and remains negative for both types of impurities. We find that magnetic scatterers leading to enhanced/suppressed interband scattering modifies the magnitude of the signal, but does not affect its qualitative behavior. In contrast, the presence of tilt in the band dispersion induces a pronounced anisotropic response, including a magnetic-field-direction dependent sign reversal that can be categorized into weak and strong regimes. Furthermore, the CNLH response shows substantial directional anisotropy governed by the relative orientation of the external magnetic field and the tilt vector. Our findings will be helpful in designing the experimental setup to get direction-dependent conductivity, which can be tuned externally with the help of magnetic impurity sites.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.00821v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Metrics for spin-based computing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17653</link><description>arXiv:2510.17653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-based computing is emerging as a powerful approach for energy-efficient and high-performance solutions to future data processing hardware. Spintronic devices function by electrically manipulating the collective dynamics of the electron spin, that is inherently non-volatile, nonlinear and fast-operating, and can couple to other degrees of freedom such as photonic and phononic systems. This review explores key advances in integrating magnetic and spintronic elements into computational architectures, ranging from fundamental components like radio-frequency neurons/synapses and spintronic probabilistic-bits to broader frameworks such as reservoir computing and magnetic Ising machines. We discuss hardware-specific and task-dependent metrics to evaluate the computing performance of spin-based components and associate them with physical properties. Finally, we discuss challenges and future opportunities, highlighting the potential of spin-based computing in next-generation technologies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.17653v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Open quantum theory of magnetoresistance in mesoscopic magnetic materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24586</link><description>arXiv:2512.24586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetoresistance (MR) in magnetic materials arises from spin-exchange coupling between local moments and itinerant electrons, representing a challenging many-body open-quantum problem. Here we develop a comprehensive microscopic theory of MR within an open-quantum-system framework by solving the Liouville-von Neumann equation for a hybrid system of free electrons and local moments using the time-convolutionless projection operator method. Our approach reveals both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic MR as consequences of temperature- and field-dependent spin decoherence, encompassing spin relaxation and dephasing. In particular, the resistance associated with spin decoherence is governed by the order parameters of magnetic materials, such as the magnetization in ferromagnets and the N\'eel vector in antiferromagnets. This theory deepens the fundamental understanding of MR and offers guidance for interpreting and designing experiments on magnetic materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24586v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Evidence for the suppression of the hybrid skin-topological effect by fragile topology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00347</link><description>arXiv:2601.00347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological insulators are well-known for their topological edge states, which are protected by the non-trivial bulk topology and characterized by gapless Wannier bands, a phenomenon known as the bulk-boundary correspondence. However, fragile topology challenged this concept, the Wannier bands are gapped, but the edge states still exist with similar protection. Previous studies on fragile topology have primarily focused on the spectral flow under twisted boundary conditions, but the discussion on the physical interpretation of the Wannier gap is limited. In this study, we introduce a bilayer breathing honeycomb lattice with spiral interlayer couplings inside the unit cell. As we increase the interlayer coupling strength, the Wannier gap increases monotonically and the bandgap first increases then decreases. After introducing a gain-loss domain wall, the hybrid skin-topological effect (HSTE) emerges, and the topological edge states under the periodic boundary condition (PBC) change into corner states under the open boundary condition (OBC) associated with the significant spectral difference. HSTE is suppressed as the interlayer coupling strength increases, the spectral difference between the two boundary conditions has an overall decreasing trend, which more closely mirrors the evolution of the inverse of the Wannier gap. Moreover, some of the corner states transform into edge states. Our work first provides evidence for the relation between fragile topology and HSTE, shedding new insights into the underlying mechanism of Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE).</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00347v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Lindbladian versus Postselected Non-Hermitian Topology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07187</link><description>arXiv:2507.07187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent topological classification of non-Hermitian `Hamiltonians' is usually interpreted in terms of pure quantum states that decay or grow with time. However, many-body systems with loss and gain are typically better described by mixed-state open quantum dynamics, which only correspond to pure-state non-Hermitian dynamics upon a postselection of measurement outcomes. Since postselection becomes exponentially costly with particle number, we here investigate to what extent the most important example of non-Hermitian topology can survive without it: the non-Hermitian skin effect and its relationship to a bulk winding number in one spatial dimension. After defining the winding number of the Lindbladian superoperator for a quadratic fermion system, we systematically relate it to the winding number of the associated postselected non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We prove that the two winding numbers are equal (opposite) in the absence of gain (loss), and provide a physical explanation for this relationship. When both loss and gain are present, the Lindbladian winding number typically remains quantized and non-zero, though it can change sign at a phase transition separating the loss and gain-dominated regimes. This transition, which leads to a reversal of the Lindbladian skin effect localization, is rendered invisible by postselection. We also identify a case where removing postselection induces a skin effect from otherwise topologically trivial non-Hermitian dynamics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.07187v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Stochastic interpretation of quantum mechanics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06418</link><description>arXiv:2510.06418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We express the probabilistic character associated to the wave function by treating it as a stochastic variable. This is accomplished by means of a stochastic equation for the wave function whose noise changes the phase of the wave function but not its absolute value, so that the norm of the wave function is strictly conserved along a stochastic trajectory. We show that the density matrix that obeys the quantum Liouville equation is the covariance matrix associated to the stochastic wave function.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.06418v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Bare-Metal Tensor Virtualization: Overcoming the Memory Wall in Edge-AI Inference on ARM64</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03324</link><description>arXiv:2601.03324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is fundamentally constrained by the "Memory Wall" the bottleneck where data movement latency outstrips arithmetic throughput. Standard inference runtimes often incur significant overhead through high-level abstractions, dynamic dispatch, and unaligned memory access patterns. In this work, we present a novel "Virtual Tensor Core" architecture implemented in software, optimized specifically for ARM64 microarchitectures (Apple Silicon). By bypassing standard library containers in favor of direct memory mapping (mmap) and implementing hand-tuned NEON SIMD kernels, we achieve a form of "Software-Defined Direct Memory Access (DMA)." Our proposed Tensor Virtualization Layout (TVL) guarantees 100% cache line utilization for weight matrices, while our zero-copy loader eliminates initialization latency. Experimental results on a 110M parameter model demonstrate a stable throughput of &gt;60 tokens/second on M2 hardware. While proprietary hardware accelerators (e.g., Apple AMX) can achieve higher peak throughput, our architecture provides a fully open, portable, and deterministic reference implementation for studying the memory bottleneck on general-purpose ARM silicon, meeting the 200ms psycholinguistic latency threshold without opaque dependencies.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03324v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] GAP-LA: GPU-Accelerated Performance-Driven Layer Assignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13375</link><description>arXiv:2507.13375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Layer assignment is critical for global routing of VLSI circuits. It converts 2D routing paths into 3D routing solutions by determining the proper metal layer for each routing segments to minimize congestion and via count. As different layers have different unit resistance and capacitance, layer assignment also has significant impacts to timing and power. With growing design complexity, it becomes increasingly challenging to simultaneously optimize timing, power, and congestion efficiently. Existing studies are mostly limited to a subset of objectives. In this paper, we propose a GPU-accelerated performance-driven layer assignment framework, GAP-LA, for holistic optimization the aforementioned objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that we can achieve 0.3%-9.9% better worst negative slack (WNS) and 2.0%-5.4% better total negative slack (TNS) while maintaining power and congestion with competitive runtime compared with ISPD 2025 contest winners, especially on designs with up to 12 millions of nets.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.13375v2</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Hybrid IEG–ISG Synthesis of Sequence-Defined Polymers via Orthogonal CuAAC and Acyl Azide Esterification</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-5ttnj?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Sequence-defined polymers demand synthetic strategies that deliver high sequence fidelity, structural complexity, and access to high–molar mass in a limited number of operations. Here we report a hybrid growth platform that combines an IEG-type Cu(I)-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) backbone with a protecting-group-free ISG step based on acyl azide esterification. In this orthogonal pairing, acyl azides and alcohols serve as built-in acyl-transfer partners, enabling clean ester formation under mild conditions without external activating agents, while CuAAC provides a robust triazole-forming step with excellent chemoselectivity. Using two bifunctional monomers bearing hydroxyl/alkynyl and azide/acyl-azide motifs, we construct sequence-defined oligotriazoles with high–molar mass in a small number of iterative cycles. Expansion to diversified monomers further demonstrates the modularity of the approach and its capacity to encode more complex architectures. Tandem mass spectrometry reveals characteristic and diverse cleavage patterns associated with ester and triazole linkages, underscoring the potential of this acyl azide/CuAAC platform for digital polymer synthesis and readout.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-5ttnj?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Structure-Based Virtual Screening for Small-Molecule Inhibitors of HPV-16 E6</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-64n5z?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Abstract
	Human papillomavirus type 16 E6 (16E6) is a key oncogenic protein in HPV-associated cancers which enables tumor growth by promoting ubiquitination and degradation of host tumor suppressor p53. This study seeks to find inhibitors of 16E6 protein-protein interaction (PPI) through structure-based virtual screening of multiple small-molecule PPI ligand libraries. Through ADMET screenings, molecular dynamics simulations, and MM/GBSA energy calculations, ten druglike compounds were discovered. Through more in-depth analysis, three of those candidates were found to have demonstrated more favorable binding energies while maintaining comparable stability within the 16E6 pocket.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-64n5z?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Classical CR provides model-dependent activation energies (Ea) and pre-exponential factors (A) from a single heating ramp but relies on a global straight-line fit of ln[g(α)/T2] versus 1/T, which does not provide a rigorous differential definition of Ea and averages over curvature, obscuring local kinetic information since 1964. In this study, we reformulate CR in a differential framework (d-CR) by recognizing that the rigorous activation energy is given by the local derivative of ln[g(α)/T2] versus 1/T. In the infinitesimal-window limit, the CR relation yields conversion-resolved kinetic triplets {Ea(α), A(α), dα/dt} along a single heating rate for any chosen solid-state model. This converts CR from a single {Ea, A} pair into a dense kinetic field that enables two internal consistency checks unavailable in the classical workflow: (i) point-by-point rate-parity tests between reconstructed and experimental rates and (ii) conversion-variant compensation analysis in the {Ea(α), ln A(α)} plane. We benchmark d-CR against classical CR on non-catalyzed and zeolite-catalyzed thermolysis of pristine low-density polyethylene (LDPE), quantifying the bias introduced by global CR linearization even at high R2 and embedding d-CR into the isoconversional model selection workflow. To test applicability beyond polymers and thermogravimetry under isoconversional-free conditions, we apply d-CR to dehydration of Na2HPO4 and temperature-programmed in-situ FT-IR at a single heating rate.

Here, we investigate whether CTCF and cohesin co-binding on DNA imposes constraints on DNA replication, leading to DNA damage and genomic instability. Our results reveal that CTCF and cohesin remain co-bound to DNA during replication in cancer cells (HeLa). Furthermore, analysis of DNA damage response/repair (DDR) proteins — including MRE11, STN1, γH2AX, and RAD51 — showed a high enrichment of these proteins at CBSs, compared to immediate flanking regions.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00021-0?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] &lt;i&gt;Chlorella&lt;/i&gt;-derived extracellular vesicle-based nanogels suppress cGAS-STING for treatment of radiation-induced lung injury</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-68140-2</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 08 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-68140-2"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-025-68140-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI), a serious complication of radiation exposure, is associated with cGAS-STING pathway overactivation.

Despite its efficacy, systemic pilocarpine is limited by side effects, while existing local delivery methods (e.g., mouthwashes and sprays) are inconsistent in their efficacy. This study aimed to develop a novel localized delivery system—pilocarpine-loaded hyaluronic acid microneedles (PHMNs)—to overcome the limitations of previous topical approaches by enabling efficient intradermal drug delivery directly to the salivary gland region. The PHMNs, fabricated via a two-step molding process, exhibited robust mechanical strength (1.5 N per needle) for reliable skin penetration and rapid dissolution within 15 min &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;in vivo&lt;/span&gt;. In non-obese diabetic mice, a model of SS, the PHMNs stimulated salivary secretion to a level comparable with that achieved by systemic (intraperitoneal or oral) pilocarpine administration. Crucially, pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that the PHMN group maintained significantly lower systemic drug exposure (with no sharp peak and minimal blood concentrations at 30–60 min) than both systemic routes. Furthermore, mice treated with PHMNs for 10 days showed a sustained reduction in daily water intake, indicating effective alleviation of dry mouth symptoms. By combining the precision of intradermal delivery with the biocompatibility of hyaluronic acid, this PHMN system offers a promising, differentiated strategy for managing SS-related xerostomia, providing potent local efficacy while minimizing the risk of systemic side effects associated with conventional pilocarpine therapies.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Materials Current Issue</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apm/article/14/1/011104/3376929/Pilocarpine-loaded-hyaluronic-acid-microneedles</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Centrosomal P4.1-associated protein (CPAP) is a novel regulator of ESCRT pathway function during endosome maturation</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00034-9?rss=yes</link><description>Previously, we reported that Centrosomal P4.1-associated protein (CPAP/CENPJ/SAS-4) positively regulates multivesicular body (MVB) biogenesis and endocytic vesicular transport (EVT). Here, we show that CPAP is required for Rab5-to-Rab7 conversion, and recruitment of TSG101 to early endosome (EE) is the molecular mechanism by which CPAP promotes MVB formation. CPAP depletion disrupts Rab7 and TSG101 recruitment to EE and blocks endosome maturation. While endogenous CPAP co-precipitates with ESCRT-proteins TSG101, HRS and ALIX, exogenously expressed CPAP only interacts with TSG101.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00034-9?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] A multi-task learning approach for prediction of missing bioactivity values of compounds for the SLC transporter superfamily</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2026/DD/D5DD00536A</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/image/GA?id=D5DD00536A" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2026, Advance Article&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00536A, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Tarik Ćerimagić, Sergey Sosnin, Gerhard F.

Abstract: The synthesis of nanocrystals has been highly dependent on trial-and-error, due to the complex correlation between synthesis parameters and physicochemical properties. Although deep learning offers a potential methodology to achieve generative inverse design, it is still hindered by the scarcity of high-quality datasets that align nanocrystal synthesis routes with their properties. Here, we present the construction of a large-scale, aligned Nanocrystal Synthesis-Property (NSP) database and demonstrate its capability for generative inverse design. To extract structured synthesis routes and their corresponding product properties from literature, we develop NanoExtractor, a large language model (LLM) enhanced by well-designed augmentation strategies. NanoExtractor is validated against human experts, achieving a weighted average score of 88% on the test set, significantly outperforming chemistry-specialized (3%) and general-purpose LLMs (38%). The resulting NSP database contains nearly 160,000 aligned entries and serves as training data for our NanoDesigner, an LLM for inverse synthesis design. The generative capability of NanoDesigner is validated through the successful design of viable synthesis routes for both well-established PbSe nanocrystals and rarely reported MgF2 nanocrystals. Notably, the model recommends a counter-intuitive, non-stoichiometric precursor ratio (1:1) for MgF2 nanocrystals, which is experimentally confirmed as critical for suppressing byproducts. Our work bridges the gap between unstructured literature and data-driven synthesis, and also establishes a powerful human-AI collaborative paradigm for accelerating nanocrystal discovery.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02424v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Protein-Water Energy Transfer via Anharmonic Low-Frequency Vibrations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02699</link><description>arXiv:2601.02699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat dissipation is ubiquitous in living systems, which constantly convert distinct forms of energy into each other. The transport of thermal energy in liquids and even within proteins is well understood but kinetic energy transfer across a heterogeneous molecular boundary provides additional challenges. Here, we use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations under steady-state conditions to analyze how a protein dissipates surplus thermal energy into the surrounding solvent. We specifically focus on collective degrees of freedom that govern the dynamics of the system from the diffusive regime to mid-infrared frequencies. Using a fully anharmonic analysis of molecular vibrations, we analyzed their vibrational spectra, temperatures, and heat transport efficiencies. We find that the most efficient energy transfer mechanisms are associated with solvent-mediated friction. However, this mechanism only applies to a small number of degrees of freedom of a protein. Instead, less efficient vibrational energy transfer in the far-infrared dominates heat transfer overall due to a large number of vibrations in this frequency range. A notable by-product of this work is a highly sensitive measure of deviations from energy equi-partition in equilibrium systems, which can be used to analyze non-ergodic properties.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02699v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interplay of Structure and Dynamics in Solid Polymer Electrolytes: a Molecular Dynamics Study of LiPF6/polypropylene carbonate</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02869</link><description>arXiv:2601.02869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state batteries (SSB) are emerging as next-generation electrochemical energy storage devices. Achieving high energy density in SSB relies on solid polymer electrolytes (SPE) that are electrochemically stable against both lithium metal and high-potential positive electrodes, two conditions that are difficult to satisfy without chemical degradation. In this work, molecular dynamics simulations are employed to investigate the relationship between structure and dynamics in carbonate-based SPE composed of polypropylene carbonate and lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF$_6$), at salt concentrations ranging from 0.32 to 1.21 mol$/$kg. Structural properties are analyzed under ambient pressure at the experimentally relevant temperature $T = 353$ K. Since the slow dynamical processes governing ion transport in these systems are inaccessible to direct molecular dynamics, transport properties are simulated at elevated temperatures up to 900 K and extrapolated to $T = 353$ K using Arrhenius behavior. The results reveal strong ionic correlations, a limited fraction of free ions, and a predominance of negatively charged clusters, especially at high salt concentration. At high temperature, the self-diffusion coefficient of Li$^+$ exceeds that of PF$_6^-$ due to weaker Li$^+$-carbonate and ion-ion interactions. However, at $T = 353$ K, Li$^+$ mobility becomes lower than that of the anion, consistent with typical experimental observations in SPE. As expected, the ionic conductivity $\sigma$ increases with temperature, while at $T = 353$ K it exhibits a maximum for salt concentrations between 1.0 and 1.1 mol$/$kg. Overall, the estimated physico-chemical parameters highlight the key role of ion correlations in SPE and suggest strategies to optimize electrolyte performance. The Arrhenius extrapolation approach used here provides valuable insight into ion transport mechanisms in solid polymer electrolytes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02869v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] DeepH-pack: A general-purpose neural network package for deep-learning electronic structure calculations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02938</link><description>arXiv:2601.02938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In computational physics and materials science, first-principles methods, particularly density functional theory, have become central tools for electronic structure prediction and materials design. Recently, rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have begun to reshape the research landscape, giving rise to the emerging field of deep-learning electronic structure calculations. Despite numerous pioneering studies, the field remains in its early stages; existing software implementations are often fragmented, lacking unified frameworks and standardized interfaces required for broad community adoption. Here we present DeepH-pack, a comprehensive and unified software package that integrates first-principles calculations with deep learning. By incorporating fundamental physical principles into neural-network design, such as the nearsightedness principle and the equivariance principle, DeepH-pack achieves robust cross-scale and cross-material generalizability. This allows models trained on small-scale structures to generalize to large-scale and previously unseen materials. The toolkit preserves first-principles accuracy while accelerating electronic structure calculations by several orders of magnitude, establishing an efficient and intelligent computational paradigm for large-scale materials simulation, high-throughput materials database construction, and AI-driven materials discovery.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02938v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Novel fast Li-ion conductors for solid-state electrolytes from first-principles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03151</link><description>arXiv:2601.03151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a high-throughput computational screening for fast lithium-ion conductors to identify promising materials for application in all solid-state electrolytes. Starting from more than 30,000 Li-containing experimental structures sourced from Crystallography Open Database, Inorganic Crystal Structure Database and Materials Platform for Data Science, we perform highly automated calculations to identify electronic insulators. On these ~1000 structures, we use molecular dynamics simulations to estimate Li-ion diffusivities using the pinball model, which describes the potential energy landscape of diffusing lithium with accuracy similar to density functional theory while being 200-500 times faster. Then we study the ~60 most promising and previously unknown fast conductors with full first-principles molecular dynamics simulations at several temperatures to estimate their activation barriers. The results are discussed in detail for the 9 fastest conductors, including $Li_7NbO_6$ which shows a remarkable ionic conductivity of ~5 mS/cm at room temperature. We further present the entire screening protocol, including the workflows where the accuracy of the pinball model is improved self-consistently, necessary to automatically running the required calculations and analysing their results.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03151v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Kinetic Flux Equations for Ion Exchange in Silicate Glasses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03207</link><description>arXiv:2601.03207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion exchange kinetic flux equations have been extensively investigated since the mid-twentieth century and continue to provide a fundamental framework for describing mass transport phenomena in solid materials. Despite the maturity of this field, inconsistencies remain in the literature concerning the definition, dimensional consistency, and physical interpretation of the parameters involved. A rigorous and unified treatment of these equations is therefore essential to ensure the reproducibility and comparability of theoretical and experimental studies. The present study aims to establish a coherent and systematic development of ion exchange kinetic flux equations, with particular emphasis on the consistent definition and dimensional formulation of the relevant physical quantities. Beyond refining the theoretical foundations, this study extends the classical formulation by incorporating the influence of mechanical stress on ion transport and considering cross-term interactions within the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics. These developments provide a more comprehensive description of ion exchange kinetics, particularly as applied to silicate glasses, where coupling between chemical and mechanical effects plays a crucial role in determining transport behavior and performance.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03207v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine Learning H-theorem</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14003</link><description>arXiv:2508.14003v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: H-theorem provides a microscopic foundation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics and is therefore essential to establishing statistical physics, but at the same time, H-theorem has been subject to controversy that in part persists till this day. To better understand H-theorem and its relation to the arrow of time, we study the equilibration of randomly oriented and positioned hard disks with periodic boundary conditions. Using a model based on the DeepSets architecture, which imposes permutation invariance of the particle labels, we train a model to capture the irreversibility of the H-functional.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.14003v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Bloch oscillations of helicoidal spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in deep optical lattices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14873</link><description>arXiv:2509.14873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider helicoidal spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in deep optical lattice and study the dynamics of Bloch oscillation. We show that the variation of helicoidal gauge potential with spin-orbit coupling is different in zero-momentum and plane-wave phases. The characteristics of Bloch oscillation are different in the two phases. In the zero-momentum phase, the Bloch oscillation is harmonic while it is anharmonic in the plane-wave phase. The amplitude of Bloch oscillation is found to be affected by the helicoidal gauge potential and spin-orbit coupling. We examine that the decay of Bloch oscillation caused by mean-field interaction can be managed by helicoidal spin-orbit coupling.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.14873v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Tuning Separator Chemistry: Improving Zn Anode Compatibility via Functionalized Chitin Nanofibers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19449</link><description>arXiv:2512.19449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aqueous zinc (Zn) batteries (AZBs) face significant challenges due to the limited compatibility of Zn anodes with conventional separators, leading to dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and poor cycling stability. While separator design is crucial for optimizing battery performance, its potential remains underexplored. The commonly used glass fiber (GF) filters were not originally designed as battery separators. To address their limitations, nanochitin derived from waste shrimp shells was used to fabricate separators with varying concentrations of amine and carboxylic functional groups. This study investigates how the type and concentration of these groups influence the separator's properties and performance. In a mild acidic electrolyte that protonates the amine groups, the results showed that the density of both ammonium and carboxylic groups in the separators significantly affected water structure and ionic conductivity. Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering (QENS) revealed that low-functionalized chitin, particularly with only ammonium groups, promotes strongly bound water with restricted mobility, thereby enhancing Zn plating and stripping kinetics. These separators exhibit exceptional Zn stability over 2000 hours at low current densities (0.5 mA/cm2), maintaining low overpotentials and stable polarization. Additionally, the full cell consisting of Zn||NaV3O8.1.5H2O showed a cycle life of over 2000 cycles at 2 A/g, demonstrating the compatibility of the nanochitin-based separators with low concentrations of functional surface groups. These results demonstrate the importance of a simple separator design for improving the overall performance of AZBs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.19449v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Unsupervised Topological Phase Discovery in Periodically Driven Systems via Floquet-Bloch State</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24822</link><description>arXiv:2512.24822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Floquet engineering offers an unparalleled platform for realizing novel non-equilibrium topological phases. However, the unique structure of Floquet systems, which includes multiple quasienergy gaps, poses a significant challenge to classification using conventional analytical methods. We propose a novel unsupervised machine learning framework that employs a kernel defined in momentum-time ($\boldsymbol{k},t$) space, constructed directly from Floquet-Bloch eigenstates. This approach is intrinsically data-driven and requires no prior knowledge of the underlying topological invariants, providing a fundamental advantage over prior methods that rely on abstract concepts like the micromotion operator or homotopic transformations. Crucially, this work successfully reveals the intrinsic topological characteristics encoded within the Floquet eigenstates themselves. We demonstrate that our method robustly and simultaneously identifies the topological invariants associated with both the $0$-gap and the $\pi$-gap across various symmetry classes (1D AIII, 1D D, and 2D A), establishing a robust methodology for the systematic classification and discovery of complex non-equilibrium topological matter.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24822v2</guid></item><item><title>[Chinese Chemical Society: CCS Chemistry: Table of Contents] Accelerated Bidirectional Photochromism via Excited Bridge</title><link>https://ccs-stag.literatumonline.com/doi/abs/10.31635/ccschem.025.202506871?af=R</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.chinesechemsoc.org/cms/asset/53b39377-fc92-420e-884a-d0c623a09a7c/keyimage.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;CCS Chemistry, Ahead of Print.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI:10.31635/ccschem.025.202506871&lt;/div&gt;The bridge connecting the electron donor and acceptor is crucial for electron transfer (ET).

We report the outcomes and key insights from an open science community blind challenge focused on computational methods in drug discovery, using lead optimization data from the AI-driven Structure-enabled Antiviral Platform (ASAP) Discovery Consortium’s pan-coronavirus antiviral discovery program, in partnership with Polaris and the OpenADMET project. This collaborative initiative invited global participants from both academia and industry to develop and apply computational methods to predict the biochemical potency and crystallographic ligand poses of small molecules against key coronavirus targets, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) main protease (Mpro), as well as multiple ADMET assay endpoints, using previously undisclosed comprehensive experimental drug discovery datasets as benchmarks. By evaluating submissions across multiple tasks and compounds, we established performance leaderboards and conducted meta-analyses to assess methodological strengths, common pitfalls, and areas for improvement. This analysis provides a foundation for best practices in real-world machine learning evaluation, grounded in community-driven benchmarking. We also highlight how next-generation platforms, such as Polaris, enable rigorous challenge design, embedded evaluation frameworks, and broad community engagement. This paper reports the collective findings of the challenge, offering a high-level overview of the data, evaluation infrastructure, and top- performing strategies. We further provide context and support for the accompanying papers authored by the challenge participants in this special issue, which explore individual approaches in greater depth. Together, these contributions aim to advance reproducible, trustworthy, and high-impact computational methods in drug discovery, and to explore best practices and pitfalls in future blind challenge design and execution, including planned initiatives for the OpenADMET project.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-zd9mr-v6?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Uncertainty-aware machine learning to predict non-cancer human toxicity for the global chemicals market</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67374-4</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 07 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67374-4"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-025-67374-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Uncertainty-aware machine learning models predict human toxicity for more than 100,000 chemicals, highlighting potency and uncertainty hotspots to guide safer use and to focus efforts to improve prediction confidence.</description><author>Nature Communications</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67374-4</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Learning EXAFS from atomic structure through physics-informed machine learning</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-sv3f6?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) provides element-specific access to local atomic environments and is widely used to relate structure and reactivity across chemical systems. However, quantitative EXAFS interpretation still relies on manually constructed structural models and extensive parameter tuning, creating a growing bottleneck as experimental datasets increase in size and complexity. Addressing this bottleneck requires a direct and systematic mapping between atomic structure and EXAFS response. Here we introduce AI-EXAFS, a physics-informed graph neural network that predicts full EXAFS spectra directly from three-dimensional atomic coordinates. By formulating the learning problem around the physical principles governing EXAFS signal formation, the model learns transferable structure–spectrum relationships and eliminates the need for user-defined parameter selection at inference. Trained on 86,000 transition-metal complexes, AI-EXAFS reproduces reference theoretical spectra with accuracy consistent with established EXAFS analysis practice and generalizes to experimentally relevant systems, including platinum single-atom catalysts. AI-EXAFS provides an accurate and readily deployable forward model for EXAFS, enabling standardized first-pass structural screening and offering a scalable foundation for future extensions toward more realistic and data-rich EXAFS analysis.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-sv3f6?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Defined by Shape: Elucidating the Molecular Recognition of Dynamic Loops with Covalent Ligands</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-qwc85?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Protein loops harness conformational heterogeneity to perform an array of functions, ranging from catalyzing enzymatic reactions to communicating allosteric signals. Although attractive targets for small molecule modulation, these functional hubs are often considered unligandable due to their lack of well-defined binding pockets and highly dynamic structure. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated the power of covalent chemistry to selectively capture cryptic pockets formed by protein loops. Herein, we leverage machine learning to elucidate the molecular basis of covalent ligand:loop recognition in the transcriptional coactivator Med25. Key to our success was classification by ligand shape prior to model training, which led to descriptive and predictive models. The models were experimentally validated through the synthesis and in vitro testing of novel top-ranked ligands, revealing canonical structure-affinity relationships, including an activity cliff. Further feature analyses identified traditional topological and spatial parameters predictive of binding, and molecular modeling uncovered a potential binding pocket with at least two distinct conformations with high shape complementarity. Collectively, these findings reveal the hidden potential of dynamic loops as specific sites for covalent small molecule modulation, challenging the notion that protein loops are unligandable and demonstrating their capacity for exquisite, shape-based molecular recognition.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-qwc85?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] QuantumPDB: A Workflow for High-Throughput Quantum Cluster Model Generation from Protein Structures</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-w5x1d?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Computational modeling of enzymes provides molecular-level insight into catalysis, but the preparation of quantum mechanical (QM) calculations starting from experimental structures is a significant bottleneck for high-throughput studies. Automated tools developed to accelerate this process may fail to generalize across distinct active site chemistries and geometries. To overcome these limitations, we present QuantumPDB, a Python package that automates the generation of hierarchical coordination/interaction spheres around an active center to create QM cluster models directly from raw protein structures. The workflow integrates structure cleaning, protonation state assignment, and QM calculation setup. It uses chemically meaningful models constructed from contact-based interaction spheres derived from Voronoi tessellation, enabling accurate representation of complex active site geometries. We provide an overview of our modular code and describe how it may be employed to automate high-throughput protein screening. To demonstrate its utility, we curated a dataset of 989 holo-enzymes from the PDB and performed QM calculations on 1,673 enzyme cluster models of 842 of these enzymes. Analysis of computed properties suggests that enzyme environments simulated with density functional theory consistently modulate substrate charge toward neutrality and reduce the substrate dipole moment. This phenomenon appears to be general, even in cases where the active site consists predominantly of neutral residues. By automating and standardizing multi-sphere QM model construction, QuantumPDB provides a robust platform for large-scale, data-driven investigations of proteins.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-w5x1d?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Generalization and Usability of Co-Folded GPCR–Ligand Complexes: A Physics-Guided Assessment</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-1rkqz?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Deep learning co-folding models for end-to-end protein–ligand structure prediction mark a major advance beyond AlphaFold2, yet their reliability for decision-making in drug discovery remains unclear. Here, we benchmark Boltz, a state-of-the-art co-folding model, using a curated set of ligand-bound human G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) from families unseen during training. We find that the receptor backbones are generally predicted with reasonable accuracy, but ligand poses often deviate significantly from experimental structures. We then evaluate physics-based refinement with rigid-receptor (Glide) and induced-fit docking (IFD-MD) methods, which recover more than half of the misplaced ligands to near-experimental accuracy. As conventional evaluations for co-folded structures focus on distance-based metrics such as root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD), which can miss subtle but consequential binding-site errors, we carry out a further assessment of Boltz performance using free-energy perturbation (FEP+), which is both accurate and sensitive to starting-structure quality, on curated congeneric ligand series with known binding affinities that target the GPCRs. A significant fraction of the 14 congeneric series tested in this fashion fail to reproduce experimental binding affinities via FEP+ when employing the Boltz generated complex, even when the binding-site RMSD is low in some cases. IFD-MD rescues these failures and restores retrospective FEP signals to native-like level for all of these series. Together, these results delineate current generalization and usability limits of co-folded GPCR–ligand complexes and motivate a workflow that pairs deep learning predictions with physics-based refinement and validation before high-stakes decisions in drug discovery.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-1rkqz?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Communications Physics] Interpolation-based coordinate descent method for parameterized quantum circuits</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-025-02473-8</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Communications Physics, Published online: 07 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-025-02473-8"&gt;doi:10.1038/s42005-025-02473-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Parameterized quantum circuits are a common tool in variational quantum algorithms and quantum machine learning.

We present ConfDENSE, a Set2Set enhanced PointNet model that learns directly from Hirshfeld promolecule electron-density point clouds, preserving full 3D electronic in- formation without downsampling.Despite using no receptor structural data, ConfDENSE accurately identifies bioac- tive conformers from ensemble inputs. For the only available human odorant receptor structures, the model’s selected conformers achieve sub-angstrom RMSDs to crystallo- graphic ligand poses and frequently outperform conventional docking. Combining ConfDENSE with explainability analysis further reveals the substruc- tures most responsible for receptor engagement, aligning with experimental interaction patterns. This ligand-centric and interpretable framework naturally supports phar- macophore extraction and scaffold-based design, enabling identification of conserved binding motifs even when receptor structures are missing. ConfDENSE thus provides a compact, physics-aware approach to computational olfaction, linking electron density, conformational preference, and odorant recognition in a structurally agnostic manner.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-8tmtg?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[AI for Science - latest papers] MOSES: combining automated ontology construction with a multi-agent system for explainable chemical knowledge reasoning</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae3127</link><description>The vast and multiscale nature of chemical knowledge—from molecular structures to material properties—presents significant challenges for both human researchers and artificial intelligence (AI) systems. While large language models (LLMs) can process chemical information, they operate as black boxes without transparent reasoning. Here, we present our multi-agent ontology system for explainable knowledge synthesis (MOSES), a framework that combines automated knowledge organization with multi-agent collaboration to create an AI system for interpretable chemical knowledge reasoning. Using supramolecular chemistry as a testbed, we automatically constructed an ontology of over 10 000 classes from 52 publications and developed a multi-agent system that enables transparent knowledge retrieval and reasoning. Evaluations by human experts and LLMs show that MOSES significantly outperforms chemistry-oriented LLMs and leading general-purpose LLMs—including GPT-4.1 and o3—as well as GraphRAG-augmented GPT-4.1 models, on complex chemical questions, achieving superior scores in both direct assessments and Elo ratings. MOSES’s traceable reasoning paths reveal how it constructs answers through iterative refinement rather than probabilistic generation. However, we observe an asymmetry in handling positive versus negative knowledge claims, underscoring fundamental challenges in open-world reasoning. Our work demonstrates a pathway toward AI systems that can reason over complex scientific knowledge in a transparent and explainable manner.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae3127</guid></item><item><title>[Cell Reports Physical Science] A review of advancements and challenges in nanoplastics detection</title><link>https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-physical-science/fulltext/S2666-3864(25)00641-1?rss=yes</link><description>Zhang et al. review cutting-edge strategies for separating, detecting, and characterizing nanoplastics across environmental and biological systems.
