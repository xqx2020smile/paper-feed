Abstract: Predicting the melting temperature (Tm) of multi-component and high-entropy alloys (HEAs) is critical for high-temperature applications but computationally expensive using traditional CALPHAD or DFT methods. In this work, we develop a gradient-boosted decision tree (XGBoost) model to predict Tm for complex alloys based on elemental properties. To ensure physical consistency, we address the issue of data leakage by excluding temperature-dependent thermodynamic descriptors (such as Gibbs free energy of mixing) and instead rely on physically motivated elemental features. The optimized model achieves a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.948 and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 9928 which is about 5% relative error for HEAs on a validation set of approximately 1300 compositions. Crucially, we validate the model using the Valence Electron Concentration (VEC) rule. Without explicit constraints during training, the model successfully captures the known stability transition between BCC and FCC phases at a VEC of approximately 6.87. These results demonstrate that data-driven models, when properly feature-engineered, can capture fundamental metallurgical principles for rapid alloy screening.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03801v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Material exploration through active learning -- METAL</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03933</link><description>arXiv:2601.03933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery and design of new materials are paramount in the development of green technologies. High entropy oxides represent one such group that has only been tentatively explored, mainly due to the inherent problem of navigating vast compositional spaces. Thanks to the emergence of machine learning, however, suitable tools are now readily available. Here, the task of finding oxygen carriers for chemical looping processes has been tackled by leveraging active learning-based strategies combined with first-principles calculations. High efficiency and efficacy have, moreover, been achieved by exploiting the power of recently developed machine learning interatomic potentials. Firstly, the proposed approaches were validated based on an established computational framework for identifying high entropy perovskites that can be used in chemical looping air separation and dry reforming. Chief among the insights thus gained was the identification of the best performing strategies, in the form of greedy or Thompson-based sampling based on uncertainty estimates obtained from Gaussian processes. Building on this newfound knowledge, the concept was applied to a more complex problem, namely the discovery of high entropy oxygen carriers for chemical looping oxygen uncoupling. This resulted in both qualitative as well as quantitative outcomes, including lists of specific materials with high oxygen transfer capacities and configurational entropies. Specifically, the best candidates were based on the known oxygen carrier CaMnO3 but also contained a variety of additional species, of which some, e.g., Ti; Co; Cu; and Ti, were expected while others were not, e.g., Y and Sm. The results suggest that adopting active learning approaches is critical in materials discovery, given that these methods are already shifting research practice and soon will be the norm.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03933v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Transport properties in a model of confined granular mixtures at moderate densities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04026</link><description>arXiv:2601.04026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work derives the Navier--Stokes hydrodynamic equations for a model of a confined, quasi-two-dimensional, $s$-component mixture of inelastic, smooth, hard spheres. Using the inelastic version of the revised Enskog theory, macroscopic balance equations for mass, momentum, and energy are obtained, and constitutive equations for the fluxes are determined through a first-order Chapman--Enskog expansion. As for elastic collisions, the transport coefficients are given in terms of the solutions of a set of coupled linear integral equations. Approximate solutions to these equations for diffusion transport coefficients and shear viscosity are achieved by assuming steady-state conditions and considering leading terms in a Sonine polynomial expansion. These transport coefficients are expressed in terms of the coefficients of restitution, concentration, the masses and diameters of the mixture's components, and the system's density. The results apply to moderate densities and are not limited to particular values of the coefficients of restitution, concentration, mass, and/or diameter ratios. As an application, the thermal diffusion factor is evaluated to analyze segregation driven by temperature gradients and gravity, providing criteria that distinguish whether larger particles accumulate near the hotter or colder boundaries.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04026v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] libMobility: A Python library for hydrodynamics at the Smoluchowski level</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02135</link><description>arXiv:2510.02135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective hydrodynamic modeling is crucial for accurately predicting fluid-particle interactions in diverse fields such as biophysics and materials science. Developing and implementing hydrodynamic algorithms is challenging due to the complexity of fluid dynamics, necessitating efficient management of large-scale computations and sophisticated boundary conditions. Furthermore, adapting these algorithms for use on massively parallel architectures like GPUs adds an additional layer of complexity. This paper presents the libMobility software library, which offers a suite of CUDA-enabled solvers for simulating hydrodynamic interactions in particulate systems at the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa (RPY) level. The library facilitates precise simulations of particle displacements influenced by external forces and torques, including both the deterministic and stochastic components. Notable features of libMobility include its ability to handle linear and angular displacements, thermal fluctuations, and various domain geometries effectively. With an interface in Python, libMobility provides comprehensive tools for researchers in computational fluid dynamics and related fields to simulate particle mobility efficiently. This article details the technical architecture, functionality, and wide-ranging applications of libMobility. libMobility is available at https://github.com/stochasticHydroTools/libMobility.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.02135v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Kinetic Flux Equations for Ion Exchange in Silicate Glasses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03207</link><description>arXiv:2601.03207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ion exchange kinetic flux equations have been extensively investigated since the mid-twentieth century and continue to provide a fundamental framework for describing mass transport phenomena in solid materials. Despite the maturity of this field, inconsistencies remain in the literature concerning the definition, dimensional consistency, and physical interpretation of the parameters involved. A rigorous and unified treatment of these equations is therefore essential to ensure the reproducibility and comparability of theoretical and experimental studies. The present study aims to establish a coherent and systematic development of ion exchange kinetic flux equations, with particular emphasis on the consistent definition and dimensional formulation of the relevant physical quantities. Beyond refining the theoretical foundations, this study extends the classical formulation by incorporating the influence of mechanical stress on ion transport and considering cross-term interactions within the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics. These developments provide a more comprehensive description of ion exchange kinetics, particularly as applied to silicate glasses, where coupling between chemical and mechanical effects plays a crucial role in determining transport behavior and performance.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03207v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Agentic Exploration of Physics Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24978</link><description>arXiv:2509.24978v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations, analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an open challenge to fully automate the heuristic, iterative loop required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large language model tool-use capabilities to enable exploration of systems without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution, and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains, without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.24978v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Masgent: An AI-assisted Materials Simulation Agent</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23010</link><description>arXiv:2512.23010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning potentials (MLPs) are essential for predicting and understanding materials properties, yet preparing, executing, and analyzing these simulations typically requires extensive scripting, multi-step procedures, and significant high-performance computing (HPC) expertise. These challenges hinder reproducibility and slow down discovery. Here, we introduce Masgent, an AI-assisted materials simulation agent that unifies structure manipulation, automated VASP input generation, DFT workflow construction and analysis, fast MLP-based simulations, and lightweight machine learning (ML) utilities within a single platform. Powered by large language models (LLMs), Masgent enables researchers to perform complex simulation tasks through natural-language interaction, eliminating most manual scripting and reducing setup time from hours to seconds. By standardizing protocols and integrating advanced simulation and data-driven tools, Masgent lowers the barrier to performing state-of-the-art computational methodologies, enabling faster hypothesis testing, pre-screening, and exploratory research for both new and experienced practitioners.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23010v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interlayer Charge-Transfer Ferroelectric Fluctuations as a Pairing Mechanism in van der Waals Superconductors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03352</link><description>arXiv:2601.03352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signatures of unconventional superconductivity have been reported in a wide range of van der Waals (vdW) materials. However, their microscopic origin remains unclear due to competing electronic orders, strong spin-orbit coupling, and structural instabilities in the normal state. Here we investigate the role of interlayer breathing and shear modes in superconducting vdW heterostructures. Contrary to conventional wisdom -- which assumes that weak interlayer bonding and large layer separation suppress electronic coupling to these modes -- we show that the associated charge transfer can generate a substantial pairing interaction. We develop a theory of superconductivity mediated by such interlayer modes and demonstrate that proximity to a ferroelectric or antiferroelectric quantum critical point provides a strong-coupling pairing channel. Within a two-dimensional model with SU(2) symmetry and in-plane isotropy, we find an accidental degeneracy between interlayer triplet states, which can occur even for an $s$-wave in-plane gap. We further show that Josephson coupling between layers, arising from either static magnetism or induced by paramagnetic correlations, can stabilize a time-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconducting state of the $s+i\,s$ type, which couples to magnetization when at least two mirror symmetries are absent. Our results are directly applicable to candidate chiral vdW superconductors such as 4Hb-TaS$_2$ and to sliding ferroelectric metals, exemplified by bilayer MoTe$_2$. More broadly, our work identifies ferroelectric fluctuations as a promising route to unconventional pairing in vdW systems and motivates experimental searches for chiral multicomponent superconductivity.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03352v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The Zubarev Double Time Greens function-A Vintage Many Body Technique</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03439</link><description>arXiv:2601.03439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lecture notes present a comprehensive and powerful many-body technique pioneered in 1960 by D. N. Zubarev. The technique, known as the Zubarev Double Time Greens Function method, was used extensively by leading solid state physicists such as John Hubbard and Laura Roth in the 1960s. We present the technique and apply it to the non-interacting electron and boson gas. We next consider the (many-body) Hubbard model and show how it yields the Stoner criterion for ferromagnetism. It is easily extendable to superconductivity and related problems. Our treatment is pedagogical and understandable to those with just an elementary understanding of second quantization.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03439v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interplay of activity and non-reciprocity in tracer dynamics: From non-equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation to giant diffusion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03591</link><description>arXiv:2601.03591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal interactions play a key role in shaping transport in active and passive systems, giving rise to striking nonequilibrium behavior. Here, we study the dynamics of a tracer -- active or passive -- embedded in a bath of active or passive particles, coupled through non-reciprocal interactions. Starting from the microscopic stochastic dynamics of the full system, we derive an overdamped generalized Langevin equation for the tracer, incorporating a non-Markovian memory kernel that captures bath-mediated correlations. This framework enables us to compute the tracer's velocity and displacement response, derive a generalized nonequilibrium fluctuation-dissipation relation that quantifies deviations from equilibrium behavior, and determine the mean-squared displacement (MSD). We find that while the MSD becomes asymptotically diffusive, the effective diffusivity depends non-monotonically on the degree of non-reciprocity and diverges at an intermediate value. This regime of giant diffusivity provides a generic mechanism for enhanced transport in active soft matter and has direct implications for biological systems exhibiting chase-and-run or predator-prey interactions. Our analytical predictions are supported by numerical simulations of active Brownian particles, highlighting experimentally accessible signatures of non-reciprocal interactions in soft matter.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03591v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interference-Induced Suppression of Doublon Transport and Prethermalization in the Extended Bose-Hubbard Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03694</link><description>arXiv:2601.03694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherent mobility of doublons, arising from second-order virtual dissociation-recombination processes, fundamentally limits their use as information carriers in the strongly interacting Bose-Hubbard model. We propose a disorder-free suppression mechanism by introducing an optimized nearest-neighbor pair-hopping term that destructively interferes with the dominant virtual hopping channel. Using the third-order Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we derive an analytical optimal condition that accounts for lattice geometry corrections. Exact numerical simulations demonstrate that this optimized scheme achieves near-complete dynamical arrest and entanglement preservation in one-dimensional chains, while in two-dimensional square lattices, it significantly suppresses ballistic spreading yet permits a slow residual expansion. Furthermore, in the many-body regime, finite-size scaling analysis identifies the observed long-lived density-wave order as a prethermal plateau emerging from the dramatic separation of microscopic and thermalization timescales.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03694v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Equivariant Neural Networks for Force-Field Models of Lattice Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04104</link><description>arXiv:2601.04104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learning (ML) force fields enable large-scale simulations with near-first-principles accuracy at substantially reduced computational cost. Recent work has extended ML force-field approaches to adiabatic dynamical simulations of condensed-matter lattice models with coupled electronic and structural or magnetic degrees of freedom. However, most existing formulations rely on hand-crafted, symmetry-aware descriptors, whose construction is often system-specific and can hinder generality and transferability across different lattice Hamiltonians. Here we introduce a symmetry-preserving framework based on equivariant neural networks (ENNs) that provides a general, data-driven mapping from local configurations of dynamical variables to the associated on-site forces in a lattice Hamiltonian. In contrast to ENN architectures developed for molecular systems -- where continuous Euclidean symmetries dominate -- our approach aims to embed the discrete point-group and internal symmetries intrinsic to lattice models directly into the neural-network representation of the force field. As a proof of principle, we construct an ENN-based force-field model for the adiabatic dynamics of the Holstein Hamiltonian on a square lattice, a canonical system for electron-lattice physics. The resulting ML-enabled large-scale dynamical simulations faithfully capture mesoscale evolution of the symmetry-breaking phase, illustrating the utility of lattice-equivariant architectures for linking microscopic electronic processes to emergent dynamical behavior in condensed-matter lattice systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04104v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Physics-Informed Gaussian Process Regression for the Constitutive Modeling of Concrete: A Data-Driven Improvement to Phenomenological Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03367</link><description>arXiv:2601.03367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and modeling the constitutive behavior of concrete is crucial for civil and defense applications, yet widely used phenomenological models such as Karagozian \&amp; Case concrete (KCC) model depend on empirically calibrated failure surfaces that lack flexibility in model form and associated uncertainty quantification. This work develops a physics-informed framework that retains the modular elastoplastic structure of KCC model while replacing its empirical failure surface with a constrained Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) surrogate that can be learned directly from experimentally accessible observables. Triaxial compression data under varying confinement levels are used for training, and the surrogate is then evaluated at confinement levels not included in the training set to assess its generalization capability. Results show that an unconstrained GPR interpolates well near training conditions but deteriorates and violates essential physical constraints under extrapolation, even when augmented with simulated data. In contrast, a physics-informed GPR that incorporates derivative-based constraints aligned with known material behavior yields markedly better accuracy and reliability, including at higher confinement levels beyond the training range. Probabilistic enforcement of these constraints also reduces predictive variance, producing tighter confidence intervals in data-scarce regimes. Overall, the proposed approach delivers a robust, uncertainty-aware surrogate that improves generalization and streamlines calibration without sacrificing the interpretability and numerical efficiency of the KCC model, offering a practical path toward an improved constitutive models for concrete.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03367v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interfacial Line Energy of a Topological Phase</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11102</link><description>arXiv:2408.11102v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In interacting topological systems, Landau-like order parameters interplay with the band topology of fermions. The physics of domain formation in such systems can get significantly altered due to the presence of topological fermions. In this work we show that coupling a topological fermionic field to a scalar field can drastically modify the nucleation processes. We find that existence of non-trivial fermionic boundary modes on the nucleating droplets of the scalar field leads to substantial quantum corrections to the interface energy. This leads to an increase in the size of the critical nucleus beyond which unrestricted droplet growth happens. To illustrate the phenomena we devise a minimal model of fermions in a Chern insulating system coupled to a classical Ising field in two spatial dimensions. Using a combination of analytic and numerical methods we conclusively demonstrate that topological phases have a characteristic quantum correction to the interfacial line energy. Apart from material systems, our work opens up a host of questions regarding the impact of fermionic topological terms on classical phase transitions and associated criticality.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2408.11102v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Effective spin model with anisotropic exchange interactions for the spin-orbit coupled Hubbard model at half-filling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05166</link><description>arXiv:2504.05166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in noncentrosymmetric materials is the source of incommensurate magnetic structures. In semiconductors, it drives the Rashba spin splitting and spin momentum locking, while in magnetic insulators based on transition metals, it induces anisotropic spin exchange interactions, like the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction which drives chiral magnetism and skyrmion formation. Here, we establish a direct connection between SOC and spin exchange interactions by deriving an effective spin model from the SOC Hubbard model at half-filling. Using a strong-coupling expansion up to fourth order by including the full set of terms, we identify Heisenberg, Ising-like, and ring exchange interactions, as well as a variety of four-body terms for realistic Hubbard parameters, which impose strong constraints on the relative strengths of the spin interactions. Our spin model shows excellent agreement in energy with the SOC Hubbard model down $U/t \sim 5$ near the metal-insulator transition point, providing insight to which kind of magnetic interactions relevant across this regime are responsible for the emergence of complex magnetic textures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.05166v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Magneto-optical Kerr effect in an A-type antiferromagnet</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16167</link><description>arXiv:2504.16167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) is a powerful probe of broken time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{T}$), typically used to study ferromagnets. While MOKE has been observed in some antiferromagnets (AFMs) with vanishing magnetization, it is often associated with structures whose symmetry is lower than basic collinear, bipartite order. In contrast, theory predicts a mechanism for MOKE intrinsic to all AFMs of A-type, i.e. layered AFMs in which ferromagnetic layers are antiferromagnetically aligned. Here we report the first experimental confirmation of this mechanism in a bulk AFM. We achieve this by measuring the imaginary component of MOKE as a function of photon energy in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, an A-type AFM where $\mathcal{T}$ is preserved in combination with a translation. By comparing the experimental results with model calculations, we demonstrate that observable MOKE should be expected in all collinear A-type AFMs with out-of-plane spin order, thus enabling optical detection of AFM domains and expanding the scope of MOKE to few-layer AFMs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.16167v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Chiral anomaly-induced nonlinear Hall effect in spin-orbit coupled noncentrosymmetric metals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00821</link><description>arXiv:2508.00821v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that chiral anomaly is not limited to Weyl semimetals (WSMs), but are also shown by a larger class of materials called spin orbit coupled noncentrosymmetric metals (SOC-NCMs),which has shed more insight into the origin of chiral anomaly as a Fermi surface property rather than a nodal property. In this study, we explore nonlinear transport responses in SOC-NCMswithin the framework of semiclassical dynamics, employing the Maxwell-Boltzmann transport theory augmented by charge conservation and momentum-dependent scattering processes. We take into account both non-magnetic and magnetic impurity scattering mechanisms. We demonstrate that the chiral-anomaly-induced nonlinear Hall (CNLH) response exhibits a characteristic quadratic dependence on the applied magnetic field and remains negative for both types of impurities. We find that magnetic scatterers leading to enhanced/suppressed interband scattering modifies the magnitude of the signal, but does not affect its qualitative behavior. In contrast, the presence of tilt in the band dispersion induces a pronounced anisotropic response, including a magnetic-field-direction dependent sign reversal that can be categorized into weak and strong regimes. Furthermore, the CNLH response shows substantial directional anisotropy governed by the relative orientation of the external magnetic field and the tilt vector. Our findings will be helpful in designing the experimental setup to get direction-dependent conductivity, which can be tuned externally with the help of magnetic impurity sites.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.00821v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Metrics for spin-based computing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17653</link><description>arXiv:2510.17653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-based computing is emerging as a powerful approach for energy-efficient and high-performance solutions to future data processing hardware. Spintronic devices function by electrically manipulating the collective dynamics of the electron spin, that is inherently non-volatile, nonlinear and fast-operating, and can couple to other degrees of freedom such as photonic and phononic systems. This review explores key advances in integrating magnetic and spintronic elements into computational architectures, ranging from fundamental components like radio-frequency neurons/synapses and spintronic probabilistic-bits to broader frameworks such as reservoir computing and magnetic Ising machines. We discuss hardware-specific and task-dependent metrics to evaluate the computing performance of spin-based components and associate them with physical properties. Finally, we discuss challenges and future opportunities, highlighting the potential of spin-based computing in next-generation technologies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.17653v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Open quantum theory of magnetoresistance in mesoscopic magnetic materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24586</link><description>arXiv:2512.24586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetoresistance (MR) in magnetic materials arises from spin-exchange coupling between local moments and itinerant electrons, representing a challenging many-body open-quantum problem. Here we develop a comprehensive microscopic theory of MR within an open-quantum-system framework by solving the Liouville-von Neumann equation for a hybrid system of free electrons and local moments using the time-convolutionless projection operator method. Our approach reveals both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic MR as consequences of temperature- and field-dependent spin decoherence, encompassing spin relaxation and dephasing. In particular, the resistance associated with spin decoherence is governed by the order parameters of magnetic materials, such as the magnetization in ferromagnets and the N\'eel vector in antiferromagnets. This theory deepens the fundamental understanding of MR and offers guidance for interpreting and designing experiments on magnetic materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24586v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Evidence for the suppression of the hybrid skin-topological effect by fragile topology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00347</link><description>arXiv:2601.00347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological insulators are well-known for their topological edge states, which are protected by the non-trivial bulk topology and characterized by gapless Wannier bands, a phenomenon known as the bulk-boundary correspondence. However, fragile topology challenged this concept, the Wannier bands are gapped, but the edge states still exist with similar protection. Previous studies on fragile topology have primarily focused on the spectral flow under twisted boundary conditions, but the discussion on the physical interpretation of the Wannier gap is limited. In this study, we introduce a bilayer breathing honeycomb lattice with spiral interlayer couplings inside the unit cell. As we increase the interlayer coupling strength, the Wannier gap increases monotonically and the bandgap first increases then decreases. After introducing a gain-loss domain wall, the hybrid skin-topological effect (HSTE) emerges, and the topological edge states under the periodic boundary condition (PBC) change into corner states under the open boundary condition (OBC) associated with the significant spectral difference. HSTE is suppressed as the interlayer coupling strength increases, the spectral difference between the two boundary conditions has an overall decreasing trend, which more closely mirrors the evolution of the inverse of the Wannier gap. Moreover, some of the corner states transform into edge states. Our work first provides evidence for the relation between fragile topology and HSTE, shedding new insights into the underlying mechanism of Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE).</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00347v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Lindbladian versus Postselected Non-Hermitian Topology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07187</link><description>arXiv:2507.07187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent topological classification of non-Hermitian `Hamiltonians' is usually interpreted in terms of pure quantum states that decay or grow with time. However, many-body systems with loss and gain are typically better described by mixed-state open quantum dynamics, which only correspond to pure-state non-Hermitian dynamics upon a postselection of measurement outcomes. Since postselection becomes exponentially costly with particle number, we here investigate to what extent the most important example of non-Hermitian topology can survive without it: the non-Hermitian skin effect and its relationship to a bulk winding number in one spatial dimension. After defining the winding number of the Lindbladian superoperator for a quadratic fermion system, we systematically relate it to the winding number of the associated postselected non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We prove that the two winding numbers are equal (opposite) in the absence of gain (loss), and provide a physical explanation for this relationship. When both loss and gain are present, the Lindbladian winding number typically remains quantized and non-zero, though it can change sign at a phase transition separating the loss and gain-dominated regimes. This transition, which leads to a reversal of the Lindbladian skin effect localization, is rendered invisible by postselection. We also identify a case where removing postselection induces a skin effect from otherwise topologically trivial non-Hermitian dynamics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.07187v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Stochastic interpretation of quantum mechanics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06418</link><description>arXiv:2510.06418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We express the probabilistic character associated to the wave function by treating it as a stochastic variable. This is accomplished by means of a stochastic equation for the wave function whose noise changes the phase of the wave function but not its absolute value, so that the norm of the wave function is strictly conserved along a stochastic trajectory. We show that the density matrix that obeys the quantum Liouville equation is the covariance matrix associated to the stochastic wave function.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.06418v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Bare-Metal Tensor Virtualization: Overcoming the Memory Wall in Edge-AI Inference on ARM64</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03324</link><description>arXiv:2601.03324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is fundamentally constrained by the "Memory Wall" the bottleneck where data movement latency outstrips arithmetic throughput. Standard inference runtimes often incur significant overhead through high-level abstractions, dynamic dispatch, and unaligned memory access patterns. In this work, we present a novel "Virtual Tensor Core" architecture implemented in software, optimized specifically for ARM64 microarchitectures (Apple Silicon). By bypassing standard library containers in favor of direct memory mapping (mmap) and implementing hand-tuned NEON SIMD kernels, we achieve a form of "Software-Defined Direct Memory Access (DMA)." Our proposed Tensor Virtualization Layout (TVL) guarantees 100% cache line utilization for weight matrices, while our zero-copy loader eliminates initialization latency. Experimental results on a 110M parameter model demonstrate a stable throughput of &gt;60 tokens/second on M2 hardware. While proprietary hardware accelerators (e.g., Apple AMX) can achieve higher peak throughput, our architecture provides a fully open, portable, and deterministic reference implementation for studying the memory bottleneck on general-purpose ARM silicon, meeting the 200ms psycholinguistic latency threshold without opaque dependencies.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03324v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] GAP-LA: GPU-Accelerated Performance-Driven Layer Assignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13375</link><description>arXiv:2507.13375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Layer assignment is critical for global routing of VLSI circuits. It converts 2D routing paths into 3D routing solutions by determining the proper metal layer for each routing segments to minimize congestion and via count. As different layers have different unit resistance and capacitance, layer assignment also has significant impacts to timing and power. With growing design complexity, it becomes increasingly challenging to simultaneously optimize timing, power, and congestion efficiently. Existing studies are mostly limited to a subset of objectives. In this paper, we propose a GPU-accelerated performance-driven layer assignment framework, GAP-LA, for holistic optimization the aforementioned objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that we can achieve 0.3%-9.9% better worst negative slack (WNS) and 2.0%-5.4% better total negative slack (TNS) while maintaining power and congestion with competitive runtime compared with ISPD 2025 contest winners, especially on designs with up to 12 millions of nets.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.13375v2</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Hybrid IEG–ISG Synthesis of Sequence-Defined Polymers via Orthogonal CuAAC and Acyl Azide Esterification</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-5ttnj?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Sequence-defined polymers demand synthetic strategies that deliver high sequence fidelity, structural complexity, and access to high–molar mass in a limited number of operations. Here we report a hybrid growth platform that combines an IEG-type Cu(I)-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) backbone with a protecting-group-free ISG step based on acyl azide esterification. In this orthogonal pairing, acyl azides and alcohols serve as built-in acyl-transfer partners, enabling clean ester formation under mild conditions without external activating agents, while CuAAC provides a robust triazole-forming step with excellent chemoselectivity. Using two bifunctional monomers bearing hydroxyl/alkynyl and azide/acyl-azide motifs, we construct sequence-defined oligotriazoles with high–molar mass in a small number of iterative cycles. Expansion to diversified monomers further demonstrates the modularity of the approach and its capacity to encode more complex architectures. Tandem mass spectrometry reveals characteristic and diverse cleavage patterns associated with ester and triazole linkages, underscoring the potential of this acyl azide/CuAAC platform for digital polymer synthesis and readout.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-5ttnj?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Structure-Based Virtual Screening for Small-Molecule Inhibitors of HPV-16 E6</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-64n5z?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Abstract
	Human papillomavirus type 16 E6 (16E6) is a key oncogenic protein in HPV-associated cancers which enables tumor growth by promoting ubiquitination and degradation of host tumor suppressor p53. This study seeks to find inhibitors of 16E6 protein-protein interaction (PPI) through structure-based virtual screening of multiple small-molecule PPI ligand libraries. Through ADMET screenings, molecular dynamics simulations, and MM/GBSA energy calculations, ten druglike compounds were discovered. Through more in-depth analysis, three of those candidates were found to have demonstrated more favorable binding energies while maintaining comparable stability within the 16E6 pocket.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-64n5z?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Abstract: The synthesis of nanocrystals has been highly dependent on trial-and-error, due to the complex correlation between synthesis parameters and physicochemical properties. Although deep learning offers a potential methodology to achieve generative inverse design, it is still hindered by the scarcity of high-quality datasets that align nanocrystal synthesis routes with their properties. Here, we present the construction of a large-scale, aligned Nanocrystal Synthesis-Property (NSP) database and demonstrate its capability for generative inverse design. To extract structured synthesis routes and their corresponding product properties from literature, we develop NanoExtractor, a large language model (LLM) enhanced by well-designed augmentation strategies. NanoExtractor is validated against human experts, achieving a weighted average score of 88% on the test set, significantly outperforming chemistry-specialized (3%) and general-purpose LLMs (38%). The resulting NSP database contains nearly 160,000 aligned entries and serves as training data for our NanoDesigner, an LLM for inverse synthesis design. The generative capability of NanoDesigner is validated through the successful design of viable synthesis routes for both well-established PbSe nanocrystals and rarely reported MgF2 nanocrystals. Notably, the model recommends a counter-intuitive, non-stoichiometric precursor ratio (1:1) for MgF2 nanocrystals, which is experimentally confirmed as critical for suppressing byproducts. Our work bridges the gap between unstructured literature and data-driven synthesis, and also establishes a powerful human-AI collaborative paradigm for accelerating nanocrystal discovery.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02424v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Protein-Water Energy Transfer via Anharmonic Low-Frequency Vibrations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02699</link><description>arXiv:2601.02699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat dissipation is ubiquitous in living systems, which constantly convert distinct forms of energy into each other. The transport of thermal energy in liquids and even within proteins is well understood but kinetic energy transfer across a heterogeneous molecular boundary provides additional challenges. Here, we use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations under steady-state conditions to analyze how a protein dissipates surplus thermal energy into the surrounding solvent. We specifically focus on collective degrees of freedom that govern the dynamics of the system from the diffusive regime to mid-infrared frequencies. Using a fully anharmonic analysis of molecular vibrations, we analyzed their vibrational spectra, temperatures, and heat transport efficiencies. We find that the most efficient energy transfer mechanisms are associated with solvent-mediated friction. However, this mechanism only applies to a small number of degrees of freedom of a protein. Instead, less efficient vibrational energy transfer in the far-infrared dominates heat transfer overall due to a large number of vibrations in this frequency range. A notable by-product of this work is a highly sensitive measure of deviations from energy equi-partition in equilibrium systems, which can be used to analyze non-ergodic properties.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02699v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interplay of Structure and Dynamics in Solid Polymer Electrolytes: a Molecular Dynamics Study of LiPF6/polypropylene carbonate</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02869</link><description>arXiv:2601.02869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state batteries (SSB) are emerging as next-generation electrochemical energy storage devices. Achieving high energy density in SSB relies on solid polymer electrolytes (SPE) that are electrochemically stable against both lithium metal and high-potential positive electrodes, two conditions that are difficult to satisfy without chemical degradation. In this work, molecular dynamics simulations are employed to investigate the relationship between structure and dynamics in carbonate-based SPE composed of polypropylene carbonate and lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF$_6$), at salt concentrations ranging from 0.32 to 1.21 mol$/$kg. Structural properties are analyzed under ambient pressure at the experimentally relevant temperature $T = 353$ K. Since the slow dynamical processes governing ion transport in these systems are inaccessible to direct molecular dynamics, transport properties are simulated at elevated temperatures up to 900 K and extrapolated to $T = 353$ K using Arrhenius behavior. The results reveal strong ionic correlations, a limited fraction of free ions, and a predominance of negatively charged clusters, especially at high salt concentration. At high temperature, the self-diffusion coefficient of Li$^+$ exceeds that of PF$_6^-$ due to weaker Li$^+$-carbonate and ion-ion interactions. However, at $T = 353$ K, Li$^+$ mobility becomes lower than that of the anion, consistent with typical experimental observations in SPE. As expected, the ionic conductivity $\sigma$ increases with temperature, while at $T = 353$ K it exhibits a maximum for salt concentrations between 1.0 and 1.1 mol$/$kg. Overall, the estimated physico-chemical parameters highlight the key role of ion correlations in SPE and suggest strategies to optimize electrolyte performance. The Arrhenius extrapolation approach used here provides valuable insight into ion transport mechanisms in solid polymer electrolytes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02869v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] DeepH-pack: A general-purpose neural network package for deep-learning electronic structure calculations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02938</link><description>arXiv:2601.02938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In computational physics and materials science, first-principles methods, particularly density functional theory, have become central tools for electronic structure prediction and materials design. Recently, rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have begun to reshape the research landscape, giving rise to the emerging field of deep-learning electronic structure calculations. Despite numerous pioneering studies, the field remains in its early stages; existing software implementations are often fragmented, lacking unified frameworks and standardized interfaces required for broad community adoption. Here we present DeepH-pack, a comprehensive and unified software package that integrates first-principles calculations with deep learning. By incorporating fundamental physical principles into neural-network design, such as the nearsightedness principle and the equivariance principle, DeepH-pack achieves robust cross-scale and cross-material generalizability. This allows models trained on small-scale structures to generalize to large-scale and previously unseen materials. The toolkit preserves first-principles accuracy while accelerating electronic structure calculations by several orders of magnitude, establishing an efficient and intelligent computational paradigm for large-scale materials simulation, high-throughput materials database construction, and AI-driven materials discovery.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02938v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Novel fast Li-ion conductors for solid-state electrolytes from first-principles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03151</link><description>arXiv:2601.03151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a high-throughput computational screening for fast lithium-ion conductors to identify promising materials for application in all solid-state electrolytes. Starting from more than 30,000 Li-containing experimental structures sourced from Crystallography Open Database, Inorganic Crystal Structure Database and Materials Platform for Data Science, we perform highly automated calculations to identify electronic insulators. On these ~1000 structures, we use molecular dynamics simulations to estimate Li-ion diffusivities using the pinball model, which describes the potential energy landscape of diffusing lithium with accuracy similar to density functional theory while being 200-500 times faster. Then we study the ~60 most promising and previously unknown fast conductors with full first-principles molecular dynamics simulations at several temperatures to estimate their activation barriers. The results are discussed in detail for the 9 fastest conductors, including $Li_7NbO_6$ which shows a remarkable ionic conductivity of ~5 mS/cm at room temperature. We further present the entire screening protocol, including the workflows where the accuracy of the pinball model is improved self-consistently, necessary to automatically running the required calculations and analysing their results.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03151v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Kinetic Flux Equations for Ion Exchange in Silicate Glasses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03207</link><description>arXiv:2601.03207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion exchange kinetic flux equations have been extensively investigated since the mid-twentieth century and continue to provide a fundamental framework for describing mass transport phenomena in solid materials. Despite the maturity of this field, inconsistencies remain in the literature concerning the definition, dimensional consistency, and physical interpretation of the parameters involved. A rigorous and unified treatment of these equations is therefore essential to ensure the reproducibility and comparability of theoretical and experimental studies. The present study aims to establish a coherent and systematic development of ion exchange kinetic flux equations, with particular emphasis on the consistent definition and dimensional formulation of the relevant physical quantities. Beyond refining the theoretical foundations, this study extends the classical formulation by incorporating the influence of mechanical stress on ion transport and considering cross-term interactions within the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics. These developments provide a more comprehensive description of ion exchange kinetics, particularly as applied to silicate glasses, where coupling between chemical and mechanical effects plays a crucial role in determining transport behavior and performance.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03207v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine Learning H-theorem</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14003</link><description>arXiv:2508.14003v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: H-theorem provides a microscopic foundation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics and is therefore essential to establishing statistical physics, but at the same time, H-theorem has been subject to controversy that in part persists till this day. To better understand H-theorem and its relation to the arrow of time, we study the equilibration of randomly oriented and positioned hard disks with periodic boundary conditions. Using a model based on the DeepSets architecture, which imposes permutation invariance of the particle labels, we train a model to capture the irreversibility of the H-functional.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.14003v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Bloch oscillations of helicoidal spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in deep optical lattices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14873</link><description>arXiv:2509.14873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider helicoidal spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in deep optical lattice and study the dynamics of Bloch oscillation. We show that the variation of helicoidal gauge potential with spin-orbit coupling is different in zero-momentum and plane-wave phases. The characteristics of Bloch oscillation are different in the two phases. In the zero-momentum phase, the Bloch oscillation is harmonic while it is anharmonic in the plane-wave phase. The amplitude of Bloch oscillation is found to be affected by the helicoidal gauge potential and spin-orbit coupling. We examine that the decay of Bloch oscillation caused by mean-field interaction can be managed by helicoidal spin-orbit coupling.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.14873v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Tuning Separator Chemistry: Improving Zn Anode Compatibility via Functionalized Chitin Nanofibers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19449</link><description>arXiv:2512.19449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aqueous zinc (Zn) batteries (AZBs) face significant challenges due to the limited compatibility of Zn anodes with conventional separators, leading to dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and poor cycling stability. While separator design is crucial for optimizing battery performance, its potential remains underexplored. The commonly used glass fiber (GF) filters were not originally designed as battery separators. To address their limitations, nanochitin derived from waste shrimp shells was used to fabricate separators with varying concentrations of amine and carboxylic functional groups. This study investigates how the type and concentration of these groups influence the separator's properties and performance. In a mild acidic electrolyte that protonates the amine groups, the results showed that the density of both ammonium and carboxylic groups in the separators significantly affected water structure and ionic conductivity. Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering (QENS) revealed that low-functionalized chitin, particularly with only ammonium groups, promotes strongly bound water with restricted mobility, thereby enhancing Zn plating and stripping kinetics. These separators exhibit exceptional Zn stability over 2000 hours at low current densities (0.5 mA/cm2), maintaining low overpotentials and stable polarization. Additionally, the full cell consisting of Zn||NaV3O8.1.5H2O showed a cycle life of over 2000 cycles at 2 A/g, demonstrating the compatibility of the nanochitin-based separators with low concentrations of functional surface groups. These results demonstrate the importance of a simple separator design for improving the overall performance of AZBs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.19449v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Unsupervised Topological Phase Discovery in Periodically Driven Systems via Floquet-Bloch State</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24822</link><description>arXiv:2512.24822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Floquet engineering offers an unparalleled platform for realizing novel non-equilibrium topological phases. However, the unique structure of Floquet systems, which includes multiple quasienergy gaps, poses a significant challenge to classification using conventional analytical methods. We propose a novel unsupervised machine learning framework that employs a kernel defined in momentum-time ($\boldsymbol{k},t$) space, constructed directly from Floquet-Bloch eigenstates. This approach is intrinsically data-driven and requires no prior knowledge of the underlying topological invariants, providing a fundamental advantage over prior methods that rely on abstract concepts like the micromotion operator or homotopic transformations. Crucially, this work successfully reveals the intrinsic topological characteristics encoded within the Floquet eigenstates themselves. We demonstrate that our method robustly and simultaneously identifies the topological invariants associated with both the $0$-gap and the $\pi$-gap across various symmetry classes (1D AIII, 1D D, and 2D A), establishing a robust methodology for the systematic classification and discovery of complex non-equilibrium topological matter.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24822v2</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Thermotropic liquid-assisted interface management enables efficient and stable perovskite solar cells and modules</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-68231-0</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 07 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-68231-0"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-025-68231-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;In this work, Chang et al. report a thermotropic liquid additive for perovskite solar cells that enables dynamic interface management, simultaneously passivating defects and suppressing ion migration to deliver high efficiency and substantially enhanced operational stability.</description><author>Nature Communications</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-68231-0</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] A Computational Community Blind Challenge on Pan-Coronavirus Drug Discovery Data</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-zd9mr-v6?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Computational blind challenges offer critical, unbiased assessment opportunities to assess and accelerate scientific progress, as demonstrated by a breadth of breakthroughs over the last decade. We report the outcomes and key insights from an open science community blind challenge focused on computational methods in drug discovery, using lead optimization data from the AI-driven Structure-enabled Antiviral Platform (ASAP) Discovery Consortium’s pan-coronavirus antiviral discovery program, in partnership with Polaris and the OpenADMET project. This collaborative initiative invited global participants from both academia and industry to develop and apply computational methods to predict the biochemical potency and crystallographic ligand poses of small molecules against key coronavirus targets, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) main protease (Mpro), as well as multiple ADMET assay endpoints, using previously undisclosed comprehensive experimental drug discovery datasets as benchmarks. By evaluating submissions across multiple tasks and compounds, we established performance leaderboards and conducted meta-analyses to assess methodological strengths, common pitfalls, and areas for improvement. This analysis provides a foundation for best practices in real-world machine learning evaluation, grounded in community-driven benchmarking. We also highlight how next-generation platforms, such as Polaris, enable rigorous challenge design, embedded evaluation frameworks, and broad community engagement. This paper reports the collective findings of the challenge, offering a high-level overview of the data, evaluation infrastructure, and top- performing strategies. We further provide context and support for the accompanying papers authored by the challenge participants in this special issue, which explore individual approaches in greater depth. Together, these contributions aim to advance reproducible, trustworthy, and high-impact computational methods in drug discovery, and to explore best practices and pitfalls in future blind challenge design and execution, including planned initiatives for the OpenADMET project.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-zd9mr-v6?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Uncertainty-aware machine learning to predict non-cancer human toxicity for the global chemicals market</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67374-4</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 07 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67374-4"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-025-67374-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Uncertainty-aware machine learning models predict human toxicity for more than 100,000 chemicals, highlighting potency and uncertainty hotspots to guide safer use and to focus efforts to improve prediction confidence.</description><author>Nature Communications</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67374-4</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Learning EXAFS from atomic structure through physics-informed machine learning</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-sv3f6?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) provides element-specific access to local atomic environments and is widely used to relate structure and reactivity across chemical systems. However, quantitative EXAFS interpretation still relies on manually constructed structural models and extensive parameter tuning, creating a growing bottleneck as experimental datasets increase in size and complexity. Addressing this bottleneck requires a direct and systematic mapping between atomic structure and EXAFS response. Here we introduce AI-EXAFS, a physics-informed graph neural network that predicts full EXAFS spectra directly from three-dimensional atomic coordinates. By formulating the learning problem around the physical principles governing EXAFS signal formation, the model learns transferable structure–spectrum relationships and eliminates the need for user-defined parameter selection at inference. Trained on 86,000 transition-metal complexes, AI-EXAFS reproduces reference theoretical spectra with accuracy consistent with established EXAFS analysis practice and generalizes to experimentally relevant systems, including platinum single-atom catalysts. AI-EXAFS provides an accurate and readily deployable forward model for EXAFS, enabling standardized first-pass structural screening and offering a scalable foundation for future extensions toward more realistic and data-rich EXAFS analysis.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-sv3f6?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Defined by Shape: Elucidating the Molecular Recognition of Dynamic Loops with Covalent Ligands</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-qwc85?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Protein loops harness conformational heterogeneity to perform an array of functions, ranging from catalyzing enzymatic reactions to communicating allosteric signals. Although attractive targets for small molecule modulation, these functional hubs are often considered unligandable due to their lack of well-defined binding pockets and highly dynamic structure. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated the power of covalent chemistry to selectively capture cryptic pockets formed by protein loops. Herein, we leverage machine learning to elucidate the molecular basis of covalent ligand:loop recognition in the transcriptional coactivator Med25. Key to our success was classification by ligand shape prior to model training, which led to descriptive and predictive models. The models were experimentally validated through the synthesis and in vitro testing of novel top-ranked ligands, revealing canonical structure-affinity relationships, including an activity cliff. Further feature analyses identified traditional topological and spatial parameters predictive of binding, and molecular modeling uncovered a potential binding pocket with at least two distinct conformations with high shape complementarity. Collectively, these findings reveal the hidden potential of dynamic loops as specific sites for covalent small molecule modulation, challenging the notion that protein loops are unligandable and demonstrating their capacity for exquisite, shape-based molecular recognition.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-qwc85?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] QuantumPDB: A Workflow for High-Throughput Quantum Cluster Model Generation from Protein Structures</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-w5x1d?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Computational modeling of enzymes provides molecular-level insight into catalysis, but the preparation of quantum mechanical (QM) calculations starting from experimental structures is a significant bottleneck for high-throughput studies. Automated tools developed to accelerate this process may fail to generalize across distinct active site chemistries and geometries. To overcome these limitations, we present QuantumPDB, a Python package that automates the generation of hierarchical coordination/interaction spheres around an active center to create QM cluster models directly from raw protein structures. The workflow integrates structure cleaning, protonation state assignment, and QM calculation setup. It uses chemically meaningful models constructed from contact-based interaction spheres derived from Voronoi tessellation, enabling accurate representation of complex active site geometries. We provide an overview of our modular code and describe how it may be employed to automate high-throughput protein screening. To demonstrate its utility, we curated a dataset of 989 holo-enzymes from the PDB and performed QM calculations on 1,673 enzyme cluster models of 842 of these enzymes. Analysis of computed properties suggests that enzyme environments simulated with density functional theory consistently modulate substrate charge toward neutrality and reduce the substrate dipole moment. This phenomenon appears to be general, even in cases where the active site consists predominantly of neutral residues. By automating and standardizing multi-sphere QM model construction, QuantumPDB provides a robust platform for large-scale, data-driven investigations of proteins.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-w5x1d?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Generalization and Usability of Co-Folded GPCR–Ligand Complexes: A Physics-Guided Assessment</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-1rkqz?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Deep learning co-folding models for end-to-end protein–ligand structure prediction mark a major advance beyond AlphaFold2, yet their reliability for decision-making in drug discovery remains unclear. Here, we benchmark Boltz, a state-of-the-art co-folding model, using a curated set of ligand-bound human G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) from families unseen during training. We find that the receptor backbones are generally predicted with reasonable accuracy, but ligand poses often deviate significantly from experimental structures. We then evaluate physics-based refinement with rigid-receptor (Glide) and induced-fit docking (IFD-MD) methods, which recover more than half of the misplaced ligands to near-experimental accuracy. As conventional evaluations for co-folded structures focus on distance-based metrics such as root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD), which can miss subtle but consequential binding-site errors, we carry out a further assessment of Boltz performance using free-energy perturbation (FEP+), which is both accurate and sensitive to starting-structure quality, on curated congeneric ligand series with known binding affinities that target the GPCRs. A significant fraction of the 14 congeneric series tested in this fashion fail to reproduce experimental binding affinities via FEP+ when employing the Boltz generated complex, even when the binding-site RMSD is low in some cases. IFD-MD rescues these failures and restores retrospective FEP signals to native-like level for all of these series. Together, these results delineate current generalization and usability limits of co-folded GPCR–ligand complexes and motivate a workflow that pairs deep learning predictions with physics-based refinement and validation before high-stakes decisions in drug discovery.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-1rkqz?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Communications Physics] Interpolation-based coordinate descent method for parameterized quantum circuits</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-025-02473-8</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Communications Physics, Published online: 07 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-025-02473-8"&gt;doi:10.1038/s42005-025-02473-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Parameterized quantum circuits are a common tool in variational quantum algorithms and quantum machine learning.

We present ConfDENSE, a Set2Set enhanced PointNet model that learns directly from Hirshfeld promolecule electron-density point clouds, preserving full 3D electronic in- formation without downsampling.Despite using no receptor structural data, ConfDENSE accurately identifies bioac- tive conformers from ensemble inputs. For the only available human odorant receptor structures, the model’s selected conformers achieve sub-angstrom RMSDs to crystallo- graphic ligand poses and frequently outperform conventional docking. Combining ConfDENSE with explainability analysis further reveals the substruc- tures most responsible for receptor engagement, aligning with experimental interaction patterns. This ligand-centric and interpretable framework naturally supports phar- macophore extraction and scaffold-based design, enabling identification of conserved binding motifs even when receptor structures are missing. ConfDENSE thus provides a compact, physics-aware approach to computational olfaction, linking electron density, conformational preference, and odorant recognition in a structurally agnostic manner.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-8tmtg?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[AI for Science - latest papers] MOSES: combining automated ontology construction with a multi-agent system for explainable chemical knowledge reasoning</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae3127</link><description>The vast and multiscale nature of chemical knowledge—from molecular structures to material properties—presents significant challenges for both human researchers and artificial intelligence (AI) systems. While large language models (LLMs) can process chemical information, they operate as black boxes without transparent reasoning. Here, we present our multi-agent ontology system for explainable knowledge synthesis (MOSES), a framework that combines automated knowledge organization with multi-agent collaboration to create an AI system for interpretable chemical knowledge reasoning. Using supramolecular chemistry as a testbed, we automatically constructed an ontology of over 10 000 classes from 52 publications and developed a multi-agent system that enables transparent knowledge retrieval and reasoning. Evaluations by human experts and LLMs show that MOSES significantly outperforms chemistry-oriented LLMs and leading general-purpose LLMs—including GPT-4.1 and o3—as well as GraphRAG-augmented GPT-4.1 models, on complex chemical questions, achieving superior scores in both direct assessments and Elo ratings. MOSES’s traceable reasoning paths reveal how it constructs answers through iterative refinement rather than probabilistic generation. However, we observe an asymmetry in handling positive versus negative knowledge claims, underscoring fundamental challenges in open-world reasoning. Our work demonstrates a pathway toward AI systems that can reason over complex scientific knowledge in a transparent and explainable manner.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae3127</guid></item><item><title>[Cell Reports Physical Science] A review of advancements and challenges in nanoplastics detection</title><link>https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-physical-science/fulltext/S2666-3864(25)00641-1?rss=yes</link><description>Zhang et al. review cutting-edge strategies for separating, detecting, and characterizing nanoplastics across environmental and biological systems.

The free-standing and rigid-flexible ordered multichannel carbon nanofibers (OM-CNFs) can absorb the volume variation of Si, effectively enhancing the mechanical strength and chemical stability of electrodes. The Si nanoparticles uniformly embedded into the highly conductive OM-CNFs matrix establish a bicontinuous structure and increase the contact area between Si and CNFs, thus boosting the rate capability.

Existing animal models fail to capture key clinical and biological features of this condition. Here, we established a panel of patient-derived organoid xenograft (PDOX) models that authentically replicate the heterogeneity of ESCC-associated cachexia in immunodeficient mice. PDOX lines exhibited slow tumor growth comparing to traditional ESCC xenografts. Heterogeneous cachexia phenotypes in PDOX-bearing mice as compared to non-tumor-bearing mice, including body weight loss, reduction in adipose tissue, reduced grip strength, and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines, were observed.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00013-1?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Public Support for Mobile Community Microgrids: Socioeconomic, Perceptual and Outage Experience Determinants of Energy Resilience</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00012-X?rss=yes</link><description>As climate-induced disasters increasingly compromise electric grid reliability, Mobile Community Microgrids (MCMs) have emerged as a promising strategy to strengthen local energy resilience. This study examines the socioeconomic and perceptual determinants of public MCM acceptance using a nationally representative survey of 1,996 U.S. residents.

Abstract: Physical properties and functionalities of materials are dictated by global crystal structures as well as local defects. To establish a structure-property relationship, not only the crystallographic symmetry but also quantitative knowledge about defects are required. Here we present a hybrid Machine Learning framework that integrates a physically-constrained variational-autoencoder (pcVAE) with different Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods to systematically accelerate and improve crystal structure refinement with resolution of defects. We chose the pyrochlore structured Ho2Ti2O7 as a model system and employed the GSAS2 package for benchmarking crystallographic parameters from Rietveld refinement. However, the function space of these material systems is highly nonlinear, which limits optimizers like traditional Rietveld refinement, into trapping at local minima. Also, these naive methods don't provide an extensive learning about the overall function space, which is essential for large space, large time consuming explorations to identify various potential regions of interest. Thus, we present the approach of exploring the high Dimensional structure parameters of defect sensitive systems via pretrained pcVAE assisted BO and Sparse Axis Aligned BO. The pcVAE projects high-Dimensional diffraction data consisting of thousands of independently measured diffraction orders into a lowD latent space while enforcing scaling invariance and physical relevance. Then via BO methods, we aim to minimize the L2 norm based chisq errors in the real and latent spaces separately between experimental and simulated diffraction patterns, thereby steering the refinement towards potential optimum crystal structure parameters.

Abstract: Generative models hold great promise for accelerating materials discovery, but their evaluation often overlooks the chemical validity and stability requirements crucial to real-world applications. Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations are the gold standard for evaluating such properties but are computationally intensive and inaccessible to non-experts. We propose a chemically grounded, user-friendly evaluation framework that integrates DFT-based stability analysis with commonly used machine learning (ML) metrics. Through systematic experiments using both perturbative and generative methods, we demonstrate that conventional ML metrics can misrepresent chemical feasibility. To address this, we propose new insights on robust metrics and highlight the importance of simulation-informed evaluation for developing reliable generative models in materials science.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00886v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Disordered Dynamics in High Dimensions: Connections to Random Matrices and Machine Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01010</link><description>arXiv:2601.01010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an overview of high dimensional dynamical systems driven by random matrices, focusing on applications to simple models of learning and generalization in machine learning theory. Using both cavity method arguments and path integrals, we review how the behavior of a coupled infinite dimensional system can be characterized as a stochastic process for each single site of the system. We provide a pedagogical treatment of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), a framework that can be flexibly applied to these settings. The DMFT single site stochastic process is fully characterized by a set of (two-time) correlation and response functions. For linear time-invariant systems, we illustrate connections between random matrix resolvents and the DMFT response. We demonstrate applications of these ideas to machine learning models such as gradient flow, stochastic gradient descent on random feature models and deep linear networks in the feature learning regime trained on random data. We demonstrate how bias and variance decompositions (analysis of ensembling/bagging etc) can be computed by averaging over subsets of the DMFT noise variables. From our formalism we also investigate how linear systems driven with random non-Hermitian matrices (such as random feature models) can exhibit non-monotonic loss curves with training time, while Hermitian matrices with the matching spectra do not, highlighting a different mechanism for non-monotonicity than small eigenvalues causing instability to label noise. Lastly, we provide asymptotic descriptions of the training and test loss dynamics for randomly initialized deep linear neural networks trained in the feature learning regime with high-dimensional random data. In this case, the time translation invariance structure is lost and the hidden layer weights are characterized as spiked random matrices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01010v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Predicting Coherent B2 Stability in Ru-Containing Refractory Alloys Through Thermodynamic Elastic Design Maps</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01326</link><description>arXiv:2601.01326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ruthenium-based B2 intermetallics are promising for refractory superalloys but are limited by the trade-off between high thermodynamic stability and elastic precipitation strain. We present a physics-guided machine learning framework integrating high-throughput Density Functional Theory (DFT), Random Forest screening, and Symbolic Regression to navigate this design space. This approach resolves the paradox where stoichiometric compounds like RuHf fail to achieve theoretical solvus temperatures. By deriving a closed-form physical law, we quantify the strain penalty: a 1% lattice misfit reduces the solvus temperature by approximately 200 degrees C. This finding confirms that maximizing thermodynamic driving force alone is insufficient. We demonstrate that multi-component alloying is structurally necessary, identifying ternary additions such as Al and Ti as essential lattice-tuning agents that zero out the elastic penalty. This framework establishes a rigorous, constraint-based protocol for alloy design, enabling the precise engineering of zero-misfit, high-stability microstructures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01326v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Common sublattice-pure van Hove singularities in the kagome superconductors $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($\textit{A}$ = K, Rb, Cs)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01428</link><description>arXiv:2601.01428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome materials offer a versatile platform for exploring correlated and topological quantum states, where van Hove singularities (VHSs) play a pivotal role in driving electronic instabilities, exhibiting distinct behaviors depending on electron filling and interaction settings. In the recently discovered kagome superconductors $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($\textit{A}$ = K, Rb, Cs), unconventional charge density wave order, superconductivity, and electronic chirality emerge, yet the nature of VHSs near the Fermi level ($\textit{E}$$_{F}$) and their connection to these exotic orders remain elusive. Here, using high-resolution polarization-dependent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we uncover a universal electronic structure across $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ that is distinct from density-functional theory predictions that show noticeable discrepancies. We identify multiple common sublattice-pure VHSs near $\textit{E}$$_{F}$, arising from strong V-$\textit{d}$/Sb-$\textit{p}$ hybridization, which significantly promote bond-order fluctuations and likely drive the observed charge density wave order. These findings provide direct spectroscopic evidence for hybridization-driven VHS formation in kagome metals and establish a unified framework for understanding the intertwined electronic instabilities in $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01428v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A Universal Model for the Resting Potential in Nanofluidic Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01536</link><description>arXiv:2601.01536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resting voltage, $V$, which is the potential drop required to nullify the electrical current ($i=0$), is a key characteristic of water desalination and energy harvesting systems that utilize macroscopically large nanoporous membranes, as well as for physiological ion channels subjected to asymmetric salt concentrations. To date, existing analytical expressions for $V_{i=0}$ have been limited to simple scenarios. In this work, we derive a universal, self-consistent theoretical model, devoid of unnecessary oversimplifying assumptions, that unifies all previous models within a single framework. This new model, verified by non-approximated numerical simulations, predicts the behavior of $V_{i=0}$ for arbitrary concentration gradients and for arbitrary diffusion coefficients and ionic valences. We show how the interplay between diffusion coefficients and ionic valencies significantly varies the system response and why it is essential to account for all system parameters. Ultimately, this model can be used to improve experimental interpretation of ion transport measurements.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01536v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Anharmonic lattice dynamics study of phonon transport in layered and molecular-crystal indium iodides</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01766</link><description>arXiv:2601.01766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indium iodides, which adopt layered or molecular-crystal-like arrangements depending on composition, are expected to exhibit low lattice thermal conductivity because of their heavy constituent atoms and weak In-I bonding. In this work, we employed first-principles anharmonic lattice dynamics calculations to systematically investigate phonon transport in indium iodides from particle- and wave-like perspectives. The calculated lattice thermal conductivities of both materials remained below 1 W/m-K over a broad temperature range. Notably, the influence of wave-like phonon transport differed by composition: in InI3, the wave-like contribution became comparable to the particle-like Peierls contribution, whereas it remained negligible in InI. We also investigated the thermal transport properties of the experimentally reported high-pressure phase of InI3. Motivated by experimental indications of stacking faults and partial disorder in indium site occupancy within the rhombohedral phase, we constructed several ordered structural models with different stacking sequences. These stacking sequences exhibited no significant energetic preference and had similar lattice thermal conductivities, suggesting that in-plane thermal transport is largely governed by the vibrational properties of the In2I6 layers themselves rather than by the specific stacking sequence. These findings provide insight into phonon transport in layered and molecular-crystal systems with structural complexity and contribute to a broader understanding of thermal transport mechanisms in layered and molecular-crystal-like materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01766v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spin-correlation Driven Ferroelectric Quantum Criticality in a Perovskite Quantum Spin-liquid System, Ba3CuSb2O9</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01906</link><description>arXiv:2601.01906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we have experimentally demonstrated spin-correlation-driven ferroelectric quantum criticality in a prototype quantum spin-liquid system, Ba3CuSb2O9, a quantum phenomenon rarely observed. The dielectric constant follows a clear T2 scaling, showing that the material behaves as a quantum paraelectric without developing ferroelectric order. Magnetically, the system avoids long-range order down to 1.8 K and instead displays a T3/2 dependence in its inverse susceptibility, a hallmark of antiferromagnetic quantum critical fluctuations. Together with known spin-orbital-lattice entanglement in this compound, these signatures point to a strong interplay between spin dynamics and the polar lattice. Our results place this perovskite spin-liquid family at the forefront of this domain and suggest the flexibility of this family in a suitable environment by tuning chemical/ external pressure.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01906v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Score-based diffusion models for accurate crystal-structure inpainting and reconstruction of hydrogen positions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01959</link><description>arXiv:2601.01959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI models, such as score-based diffusion models, have recently advanced the field of computational materials science by enabling the generation of new materials with desired properties. In addition, these models could also be leveraged to reconstruct crystal structures for which partial information is available. One relevant example is the reliable determination of atomic positions occupied by hydrogen atoms in hydrogen-containing crystalline materials. While crucial to the analysis and prediction of many materials properties, the identification of hydrogen positions can however be difficult and expensive, as it is challenging in X-ray scattering experiments and often requires dedicated neutron scattering measurements. As a consequence, inorganic crystallographic databases frequently report lattice structures where hydrogen atoms have been either omitted or inserted with heuristics or by chemical intuition. Here, we combine diffusion models from the field of materials science with techniques originally developed in computer vision for image inpainting. We present how this knowledge transfer across domains enables a much faster and more accurate completion of host structures, compared to unconditioned diffusion models or previous approaches solely based on DFT. Overall, our approach exceeds a success rate of 97% in terms of finding a structural match or predicting a more stable configuration than the initial reference, when starting both from structures that were already relaxed with DFT, or directly from the experimentally determined host structures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01959v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] New RVE concept and FFT methods in micromechanics of composites subjected to body force with compact support</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00822</link><description>arXiv:2601.00822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider static linear elastic composite materials (CMs) with periodic structure. The core of the proposed methodology is the generation of a novel dataset using specially designed body force fields with compact support (BFCS), enabling a new RVE concept that reduces the infinite periodic medium to a finite domain without boundary artifacts. This functionally reduced RVE is used for translated averaging of direct numerical simulations (DNS) results, efficiently computed via a newly developed FFT-based solver for BFCS loading. The resulting dataset captures localized field responses and is used to train machine learning (ML) and neural networks (NN) models to learn effective nonlocal surrogate operators. These operators accurately predict macroscopic responses while reflecting microstructural features and nonlocal interactions. By accounting for field localization while simultaneously eliminating influences from finite sample size and boundary effects, it provides a physically grounded and data-driven framework for constructing accurate surrogate models for the homogenization of complex materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00822v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] AutoPot: Automated and massively parallelized construction of Machine-Learning Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01185</link><description>arXiv:2601.01185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-learning potentials (MLIPs) have been a breakthrough for computational physics in bringing the accuracy of quantum mechanics to atomistic modeling. To achieve near-quantum accuracy, it is necessary that neighborhoods contained in the training set are rather close to the ones encountered during a simulation. Yet, constructing a single training set that works well for all applications is, and likely will remain, infeasible, so, one strategy is to supplement training protocols for MLIPs with additional learning methods, such as active learning, or fine-tuning. This strategy, however, yields very complex training protocols that are difficult to implement efficiently, and cumbersome to interpret, analyze, and reproduce.
  To address the above difficulties, we propose AutoPot, a software for automating the construction and archiving of MLIPs. AutoPot is based on BlackDynamite, a software operating parametric tasks, e.g., running simulations, or single-point ab initio calculations, in a highly-parallelized fashion, and Motoko, an event-based workflow manager for orchestrating interactions between the tasks. The initial version of AutoPot supports selection of training configurations from large training candidate sets, and on-the-fly selection from molecular dynamics simulations, using Moment Tensor Potentials as implemented in MLIP-2, and single-point calculations of the selected training configurations using VASP. Another strength of AutoPot is its flexibility: BlackDynamite tasks and orchestrators are Python functions to which own existing code can be easily added and manipulated without writing complex parsers. Therefore, it will be straightforward to add other MLIP and ab initio codes, and manipulate the Motoko orchestrators to implement other training protocols.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01185v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum Extreme Reservoir Computing for Phase Classification of Polymer Alloy Microstructures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02150</link><description>arXiv:2601.02150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is expected to offer new opportunities to process high-dimensional data efficiently by exploiting the exponentially large state space of quantum systems. In this work, we apply quantum extreme reservoir computing (QERC) to the classification of microstructure images of polymer alloys generated using self-consistent field theory (SCFT). While previous QML efforts have primarily focused on benchmark datasets such as MNIST, our work demonstrates the applicability of QERC to engineering data with direct materials relevance. Through numerical experiments, we examine the influence of key computational parameters-including the number of qubits, sampling cost (the number of measurement shots), and reservoir configuration-on classification performance. The resulting phase classifications are depicted as phase diagrams that illustrate the phase transitions in polymer morphology, establishing an understandable connection between quantum model outputs and material behavior. These results illustrate QERC performance on realistic materials datasets and suggest practical guidelines for quantum encoder design and model generalization. This work establishes a foundation for integrating quantum learning techniques into materials informatics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02150v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Projected branes as platforms for crystalline, superconducting, and higher-order topological phases</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23783</link><description>arXiv:2507.23783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Projected branes are constituted by only a small subset of sites of a higher-dimensional crystal, otherwise placed on a hyperplane oriented at an irrational or a rational slope therein, for which the effective Hamiltonian is constructed by systematically integrating out the sites of the parent lattice that fall outside such branes [Commun. Phys. 5, 230 (2022)]. Specifically, when such a brane is constructed from a square lattice, it gives rise to an aperiodic Fibonacci quasi-crystal or its rational approximant in one dimension. In this work, starting from square lattice-based models for topological crystalline insulators, protected by the discrete four-fold rotational ($C_4$) symmetry, we show that the resulting one-dimensional projected topological branes encode all the salient signatures of such phases in terms of robust endpoint zero-energy modes, quantized local topological markers, and mid-gap modes bound to dislocation lattice defects, despite such linear branes being devoid of the $C_4$ symmetry of the original lattice. Furthermore, we show that such branes can also feature all the hallmarks of two-dimensional strong and weak topological superconductors through Majorana zero-energy bound states residing near their endpoints and at the core of dislocation lattice defects, besides possessing suitable quantized local topological markers. Finally, we showcase a successful incarnation of a square lattice-based second-order topological insulator with the characteristic corner-localized zero modes in its geometric descendant one-dimensional quasi-crystalline or crystalline branes that feature a quantized localizer index and endpoint zero-energy modes only when one of its end points passes through a corner of the parent crystal. Possible designer quantum and meta material-based platforms to experimentally harness our theoretically proposed topological branes are discussed.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.23783v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Efficient Identification of Critical Transitions via Flow Matching: A Scalable Generative Approach for Many-Body Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15318</link><description>arXiv:2508.15318v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a machine learning framework based on Flow Matching (FM) to identify critical properties in many-body systems efficiently. Using the 2D XY model as a benchmark, we demonstrate that a single network, trained only on configurations from a small ($32\times 32$) lattice at sparse temperature points, effectively generalizes across both temperature and system size. This dual generalization enables two primary applications for large-scale computational physics: (i) a rapid "train-small, predict-large" strategy to locate phase transition points for significantly larger systems ($128\times 128$) without retraining, facilitating efficient finite-size scaling analysis; and (ii) the fast generation of high-fidelity, decorrelated initial spin configurations for large-scale Monte Carlo simulations, providing a robust starting point that bypasses the long thermalization times of traditional samplers. These capabilities arise from the combination of the Flow Matching framework, which learns stable probability-flow vector fields, and the inductive biases of the U-Net architecture that capture scale-invariant local correlations. Our approach offers a scalable and efficient tool for exploring the thermodynamic limit, serving as both a rapid explorer for phase boundaries and a high-performance initializer for high-precision studies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.15318v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Graph atomic cluster expansion for foundational machine learning interatomic potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17936</link><description>arXiv:2508.17936v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: We developed DeFecT-FF, a framework for predicting the energies and ground-state configurations of native point defects, extrinsic dopants, impurities, and defect complexes in zincblende-phase Cd/Zn-Te/Se/S compounds relevant to CdTe-based solar cells. The framework combines high-throughput DFT data with crystal graph-based machine learning force fields (MLFFs) trained to reproduce DFT energies and forces. Alloying at Cd or Te sites offers a route to tune the electronic and defect properties of CdTe absorbers for improved solar efficiency. Given the vast number of possible defect types, charge states, and symmetry-breaking configurations, traditional DFT approaches are computationally prohibitive. Our dataset includes GGA-PBE and HSE06-optimized structures for bulk, alloyed, interface, and grain-boundary systems. Using active learning, we expanded the dataset and trained MLFFs to accurately predict energies across charge states. The model enabled rapid screening and discovery of new low-energy defect configurations, validated through HSE06 calculations with spin-orbit coupling. The DeFecT-FF framework is publicly available as a nanoHUB tool, allowing users to upload crystallographic files, automatically generate defects, and compute defect formation energies versus Fermi level and chemical potentials, greatly reducing the need for expensive DFT simulations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.23514v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Time-Temperature-Transformation (TTT) Diagrams to rationalize the nucleation and quenchability of metastable $\alpha$-Li$_3$PS$_4$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05841</link><description>arXiv:2512.05841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\alpha$-Li$_3$PS$_4$ is a promising solid-state electrolyte with the highest ionic conductivity among its polymorphs. However, its formation presents a thermodynamic paradox: the $\alpha$-phase is the equilibrium phase at high temperature and transforms to the stable $\gamma$-Li$_3$PS$_4$ polymorph when cooled to room temperature; however, $\alpha$-Li$_3$PS$_4$ can be synthesized and quenched in a metastable state via rapid heating at relatively low temperatures. The origin of this synthesizability and anomalous stability has remained elusive. Here, we resolve this paradox by establishing a comprehensive time-temperature-transformation (TTT) diagram, constructed from a computational temperature-size phase diagram and experimental high-time-resolution isothermal measurements. Our density functional theory calculations reveal that at the nanoscale, the $\alpha$-phase is stabilized by its low surface energy, which drastically lowers the nucleation barrier across a wide temperature range. This size-dependent stabilization is directly visualized using in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy, capturing the rapid nucleation of nano-sized $\alpha$-phase and its subsequent slow transformation. This work presents a generalizable framework that integrates thermodynamic and kinetic factors for understanding nucleation and phase transformation mechanisms, providing a rational strategy for the targeted synthesis of functional metastable materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.05841v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Linear magnetoresistance of two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions in the quantum limit</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13475</link><description>arXiv:2512.13475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear magnetoresistance is a hallmark of 3D Weyl metals in the quantum limit.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of radiation damage in YBa$_2$Cu$3$O${7-\delta}$ (YBCO) is essential for assessing the performance of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tapes in compact fusion reactors. Existing empirical interatomic potentials have been used to model radiation damage in stoichiometric YBCO, but fail to describe oxygen-deficient compositions, which are ubiquitous in industrial Rare-Earth Barium Copper Oxide conductors and strongly influence superconducting properties. In this work, we demonstrate that modern machine-learned interatomic potentials enable predictive modelling of radiation damage in YBCO across a wide range of oxygen stoichiometries, with higher fidelity than previous empirical models. We employ two recently developed approaches: an Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) potential and a tabulated Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP). Both models accurately reproduce Density Functional Theory (DFT) energies, forces, and threshold displacement energy distributions, providing a reliable description of atomic-scale collision processes. Molecular dynamics simulations of 5 keV cascades predict enhanced peak defect production and recombination relative to a widely used empirical potential, indicating different cascade evolution. By explicitly varying oxygen deficiency, we show that total defect production depends only weakly on stoichiometry, offering insight into the robustness of radiation damage processes in oxygen-deficient YBCO. Finally, fusion-relevant 300 keV cascade simulations reveal amorphous regions with dimensions comparable to the superconducting coherence length, consistent with electron microscopy observations of neutron-irradiated HTS tapes. These results establish machine-learned interatomic potentials as efficient and predictive tools for investigating radiation damage in YBCO across relevant compositions and irradiation conditions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24430v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Controllable diatomic molecular quantum thermodynamic machines</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03131</link><description>arXiv:2504.03131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross

By leveraging the vast knowledge encoded during pre-training, prompt engineering—the systematic design and optimization of input instructions—enables researchers to guide LLMs toward accurate and domain-specific outputs without updating model parameters. This review presents the first systematic examination of prompt engineering techniques within organic chemistry, focusing on two critical application areas: text mining and predictive tasks. We analyze the core paradigms of prompt engineering, including prompt design, prompt learning, and prompt tuning, and clarify terminological inconsistencies in the literature. The discussion is contextualized within the three principal LLM architectures (encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder), with an evaluation of their respective performances on chemistry-related tasks.  Furthermore, we explore practical workflows for extracting structured chemical data from texts and knowledge graphs, as well as advanced prompt strategies for reaction condition prediction, reaction optimization, and catalytic performance prediction. This review highlights the significant potential of LLM-driven prompt engineering to accelerate discovery in organic chemistry, from synthetic pathway optimization to automated literature analysis, while also addressing persistent challenges such as the limitations associated with various prompt engineering techniques and the constraints related to each related sub-task. We conclude by outlining future research directions aimed at deepening the integration of chemical knowledge with evolving AI methodologies.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-625v3?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Ensemble Analyzer: An Open-Source Python Framework for Automated Conformer Ensemble Refinement</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-kq1wk?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Accurate prediction of molecular properties often requires considering the full conformational ensemble rather than a single optimized structure. While modern sampling tools have revolutionized conformational sampling by enabling the rapid generation of ensembles, the subsequent refinement at higher levels of theory remains computationally demanding and technically complex. Existing workflows typically rely on ad hoc scripts and manual intervention, limiting reproducibility and accessibility.
Here, we present Ensemble Analyzer (EnAn), an open-source Python framework designed to automate the refinement and analysis of conformational ensembles. Built on the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE), EnAn integrates seamlessly with widely known quantum chemistry engines such as ORCA and Gaussian, providing a modular and extensible architecture that streamlines the entire pipeline. EnAn also supports automated generation and comparison of electronic and vibronic spectra, enabling rapid visualization and interpretation. By minimizing manual data handling and standardizing workflows, EnAn effectively manages reproducible exploration of complex conformational spaces.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-kq1wk?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Electrostatic Patterning Controls Mineral Nucleation Inside Ferritin</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-8bq1h?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Ferritin protein nanocages store iron across nearly all living organisms.  In mammals, two subtypes of ferritin exist: heavy (H) chain and light (L) chain.  They have very similar 3D structures, but each performs a slightly different role in iron mineral formation.  How sequence differences between the two subtypes affect mineral formation within the nanocages is still unclear.  Single-particle reconstruction of cryo-TEM images was used to build models of unmineralized and partially mineralized human L-chain and H-chain ferritin, which showed that subtle differences in protein structure led to changes in the location of mineral formation within ferritin.  Explicit-solvent atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to explore how sequence-dependent electrostatics modulate ion transport, cluster formation, and mineral nucleation within the confined environment of human L- and H-chain apoferritin nanocages. Employing NaCl as a computational probe, we show that the internal charge distribution governs ion selectivity and nucleation pathways.  Analysis of liquid and solid ionic clusters, combined with Markov State Models (MSMs), reveals that mineralization proceeds through a two-step mechanism involving dense liquid-like precursors that crystallize homogeneously within the cavity.  These findings provide molecular insight into how ferritin sequence variability tunes confinement-driven nucleation and suggest general principles for designing biomimetic nanoreactors.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-8bq1h?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Machine Learning Prediction of Henry Coefficients of Polar and Nonpolar Gases in Covalent Organic Frameworks: Effects of Interlayer Shifts and Functionalization</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-ps69l?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising materials for gas separation and carbon capture. Computational techniques based on Monte Carlo simulation can be used to predict the gas adsorption properties of COFs with high accuracy, however they are too inefficient to be deployed in a high-throughput manner for screening large COF databases. In this paper, we systematically train and evaluate a range of machine learning models for predicting the Henry coefficients for CO2 and CH4 gas adsorption in COF materials. To account for COF structural variability, we train our models on datasets that include both chemically functionalized frameworks and interlayer displaced stacking configurations. By comparing predictive performance across descriptor–model architecture combinations, we demonstrate how different models capture the key physical factors governing gas adsorption, including electrostatics, local atomic environments, and van der Waals interactions. Our results therefore provide a framework for building machine learning models for scalable, high-throughput screening of COF materials with targeted gas adsorption properties.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-ps69l?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Bridging the Gap: Aqueous Phase Organic Synthesis as a Foundation for Advanced Chemical and Biological Discovery</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-0hw4d?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>For over a century, synthetic chemistry demanded the rigorous exclusion of water, relying on toxic, volatile organic solvents. This paradigm, while successful, is environmentally and economically costly. This review advocates for a fundamental shift: adopting water not just as a green solvent, but as a transformative medium that reshapes our understanding of reactivity and bridges chemistry with biology. Aqueous phase organic synthesis (APOS) has evolved from accidental observations to a deliberate discipline. Water’s unique properties—its high polarity, hydrogen-bonding capacity, and the hydrophobic effect—make it an active participant. This effect drives reactant aggregation and stabilizes transition states, leading to dramatic rate enhancements in pericyclic and condensation reactions. A broad range of reactions thrive in water, including classical carbon–carbon bond-forming reactions like the aldol and Diels–Alder, and modern cross-couplings (e.g., Suzuki–Miyaura) enabled by water-tolerant catalysts. Multicomponent and click chemistries are particularly powerful. Challenges like poor solubility are addressed with micellar catalysis, water-soluble ligands, and precise control of the reaction microenvironment. Beyond sustainability, APOS drives discovery, often yielding improved selectivities, new pathways, and streamlined syntheses of complex targets like pharmaceuticals. Its greatest promise lies in interfacing with biology. Bioorthogonal reactions, such as azide–alkyne cycloadditions, enable labeling and imaging in living organisms. Aqueous compatibility is essential for in situ therapeutic strategies, chemical biology, and advanced bioconjugation techniques for modifying biomolecules. The future converges with emerging technologies: machine learning to navigate complex aqueous systems, flow chemistry for scalability, and the integration of enzymatic with synthetic catalysis. This points toward a unified chemical-biological engineering paradigm. In conclusion, APOS is a mature, versatile field. It is a cornerstone of green chemistry and a critical bridge to biology, accelerating progress in medicine and materials science. Embracing water is both an environmental imperative and a strategic pathway to the next generation of scientific discovery.
Introduction: The Solvent Problem in Organic Synthesis
For generations, organic synthesis has been defined by precise control over molecular structure carried out in rigorously dried environments. Since the emergence of modern organic chemistry in the nineteenth century, water – the very medium that sustains life – has been regarded as an obstacle to chemical transformation. This long-standing assumption has shaped laboratory routines, industrial manufacturing, and chemical education, reinforcing the idea that successful synthesis depends on strict exclusion of moisture. This introduction revisits that historical mindset, evaluates its environmental and economic consequences, and presents the case for a fundamental transition toward aqueous phase organic synthesis (APOS) as a more suitable platform for future chemical and biological innovation.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-0hw4d?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

In this work, we demonstrate that liquid nitrogen quenching (LNQ) can induce a transition from a predominantly ergodic relaxor (ER) to a long-range ferroelectric (FE) state in 0.5 mol. % Mn-modified BNT single crystals. The LNQ-treated crystals exhibit a piezoelectric coefficient of 172 pC/N and a depolarization temperature of 170 °C, representing enhancements of 7 times and 95%, over the as-grown (AG) crystals. This synergistic improvement in piezoelectric performance and thermal stability is associated with enhanced rhombohedral distortion (rhombohedral angle &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;α&lt;/span&gt;: 89.857° for AG vs 89.701° for LNQ) and the ER-to-FE transition driven by LNQ.

Here, we report the design and experimental realization of a wireless Josephson parametric amplifier (WJPA) operating above 20 GHz. The wireless design eliminates losses and impedance mismatches that become problematic at high frequencies. The WJPA achieves more than 20 dB of gain across a tunable frequency range of 21–23.5 GHz, with a typical 3 dB bandwidth of 3 MHz.

Abstract: As quantum dot (QD)-based spin qubits advance toward larger, more complex device architectures, rapid, automated device characterization and data analysis tools become critical. The orientation and spacing of transition lines in a charge stability diagram (CSD) contain a fingerprint of a QD device's capacitive environment, making these measurements useful tools for device characterization. However, manually interpreting these features is time-consuming, error-prone, and impractical at scale. Here, we present an automated protocol for extracting underlying capacitive properties from CSDs. Our method integrates machine learning, image processing, and object detection to identify and track charge transitions across large datasets without manual labeling. We demonstrate this method using experimentally measured data from a strained-germanium single-quantum-well (planar) and a strained-germanium double-quantum-well (bilayer) QD device. Unlike for planar QD devices, CSDs in bilayer germanium heterostructure exhibit a larger set of transitions, including interlayer tunneling and distinct loading lines for the vertically stacked QDs, making them a powerful testbed for automation methods. By analyzing the properties of many CSDs, we can statistically estimate physically relevant quantities, like relative lever arms and capacitive couplings. Thus, our protocol enables rapid extraction of useful, nontrivial information about QD devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00067v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Atomic-Scale Mechanisms of Li-Ion Transport Mediated by Li10GeP2S12 in Composite Solid Polyethylene Oxide Electrolytes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00112</link><description>arXiv:2601.00112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer electrolytes incorporating Li$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$ (LGPS) nanoparticles show promise for solid-state lithium batteries owing to their enhanced ionic conductivity, though the governing mechanisms remain unclear. We combine molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, experimental ionic conductivity measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the effect of LGPS loading on polyethylene oxide (PEO) structure and Li-ion transport. MD and experimental results agree up to 10\% LGPS, showing a volcano-shaped conductivity trend driven by polymer segmental dynamics and interfacial effects. Beyond 10\%, experiments reveal additional conductivity enhancement unexplained by MD, suggesting a distinct transport regime. DFT calculations indicate that Li-ion migration at the PEO|LGPS interface proceeds via vacancy-mediated hopping, with low barriers favored by S-rich interfacial sites and hindered by Ge. These findings link interfacial chemistry and microstructure to Li-ion dynamics, offering guidelines for designing high-performance composite polymer electrolytes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00112v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Engineering Ideal 2D Type-II Nodal Line Semimetals via Stacking and Intercalation of van der Waals Layers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00407</link><description>arXiv:2601.00407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional type-II topological semimetals (TSMs), characterized by strongly tilted Dirac cones, have attracted intense interest for their unconventional electronic properties and exotic transport behaviors. However, rational design remains challenging due to the sensitivity of band tilting to lattice geometry, atomic coordination, and symmetry constraints. Here, we present a bottom-up approach to engineer ideal type-II nodal line semimetals (NLSMs) in van der Waals bilayers via atomic intercalation. Using monolayer $h$-AlN as a prototype, we show that fluorine-intercalated bilayer AlN (F@BL-AlN) hosts a symmetry-protected type-II nodal loop precisely at the Fermi level, enabled by preserved mirror symmetry ($\mathcal{M}_z$) and tailored interlayer hybridization. First-principles calculations reveal that fluorine not only tunes interlayer coupling but also aligns the Fermi energy with the nodal line, stabilizing the type-II NLSM phase. The system exhibits tunable electronic properties under external electric and strain fields and features a van Hove singularity that induces spontaneous ferromagnetism, realizing a ferromagnetic topological semimetal state. This work provides a versatile platform for designing type-II NLSMs and offers practical guidance for their experimental realization.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00407v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Kinetic Turing Instability and Emergent Spectral Scaling in Chiral Active Turbulence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21012</link><description>arXiv:2508.21012v5 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spontaneous emergence of coherent structures from chaotic backgrounds is a hallmark of active biological swarms. We investigate this self-organization by simulating an ensemble of polar chiral active agents that couple locally via a Kuramoto interaction. We demonstrate that the system's transition from chaos to active turbulence is characterized by quantized loop phase currents and coherent clustering, and that this transition is strictly governed by a kinetic Turing instability. By deriving the continuum kinetic theory for the model, we identify that the competition between local phase-locking and active agent motility selects a critical structural wavenumber. The instability then drives the system into a state of developed, active turbulence that exhibits stable, robust power-laws in spectral density, suggestive of universality and consistent with observations from a broad range of turbulent phenomena. Our results bridge the gap between discrete chimera states and continuous fluid turbulence, suggesting that the statistical scaling laws of active turbulence can arise from fundamental kinetic instability criteria.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.21012v5</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] New RVE concept in thermoelasticity of periodic composites subjected to compact support loading</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00018</link><description>arXiv:2601.00018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an advanced Computational Analytical Micromechanics (CAM) framework for linear thermoelastic composites (CMs) with periodic microstructures. The approach is based on an exact new Additive General Integral Equation (AGIE), formulated for compactly supported loading conditions, such as body forces and localized thermal effects (for example laser heating). In addition, new general integral equations (GIEs) are established for arbitrary mechanical and thermal loading. A unified iterative scheme is developed for solving the static AGIEs, where the compact support of loading serves as a new fundamental training parameter. At the core of the methodology lies a generalized Representative Volume Element (RVE) concept that extends Hill classical definition of the RVE. Unlike conventional RVEs, this generalized RVE is not fixed geometrically but emerges naturally from the characteristic scale of localized loading, thereby reducing the analysis of an infinite periodic medium to a finite, data-driven domain. This formulation automatically filters out nonrepresentative subsets of effective parameters while eliminating boundary effects, edge artifacts, and finite-size sample dependencies. Furthermore, the AGIE-based CAM framework integrates seamlessly with machine learning (ML) and neural network (NN) architectures, supporting the development of accurate, physics-informed surrogate nonlocal operators.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00018v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Additive general integral equations in thermoelastic micromechanics of composites</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00019</link><description>arXiv:2601.00019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents an enhanced Computational Analytical Micromechanics (CAM) framework for the analysis of linear thermoelastic composite materials (CMs) with random microstructure. The proposed approach is grounded in an exact Additive General Integral Equation (AGIE), specifically formulated for compactly supported loading, including both body forces and localized thermal changes (such as those from laser heating). New general integral equations (GIEs) for arbitrary mechanical and thermal loading are proposed. A unified iterative solution strategy is developed for the static AGIE, applicable to CMs with both perfectly and imperfectly bonded interfaces, where the compact support of loading is introduced as a new fundamental training parameter. Central to this methodology is a generalized Representative Volume Element (RVE) concept, which extends Hill classical definition. The resulting RVE is not predefined geometrically, but rather emerges from the characteristic scale of the localized loading, effectively reducing the analysis of an infinite, randomly heterogeneous medium to a finite, data-driven domain. This generalized RVE approach enables automatic exclusion of unrepresentative subsets of effective parameters, while inherently eliminating boundary effects, edge artifacts, and finite size limitations. Moreover, the AGIE-based CAM framework is naturally compatible with machine learning (ML) and neural network (NN) architectures, facilitating the construction of accurate and physically informed surrogate nonlocal operators.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00019v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Accurate Screening of Functional Materials with Machine-Learning Potential and Transfer-Learned Regressions: Heusler Alloy Benchmark</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20556</link><description>arXiv:2508.20556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A machine learning-accelerated high-throughput (HTP) workflow for the discovery of magnetic materials is presented. As a test case, we screened quaternary and all-$d$ Heusler compounds for stable compounds with large magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy ($E_{\mathrm{aniso}}$). Structure optimization and evaluation of formation energy and distance to hull convex were performed using the eSEN-30M-OAM interatomic potential, while local magnetic moments, phonon stability, magnetic stability, and $E_{\mathrm{aniso}}$ were predicted by eSEM models trained on our DxMag Heusler database. A frozen transfer learning strategy was employed to improve accuracy. Candidate compounds identified by the ML-HTP workflow were validated with density functional theory, confirming high predictive precision. We also benchmark the performance of different uMLIPs, discuss the fidelity of local magnetic moment prediction, and demonstrate generalization to unseen elements via transfer learning from a universal interatomic potential.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.20556v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Modulation of structural short-range order due to chemical patterning in multi-component amorphous interfacial complexions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06166</link><description>arXiv:2509.06166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amorphous interfacial complexions have been shown to restrict grain growth and improve damage tolerance in nanocrystalline alloys, with increased chemical complexity stabilizing the complexions themselves. Here, we investigate local chemical composition and structural short-range order in Cu-rich, multi-component nanocrystalline alloys to understand how dopants self-organize within these amorphous complexions and how local structure is altered. High resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and elemental analysis are used to study both grain boundaries and interphase boundaries, with chemical partitioning observed for both. Notably, the amorphous-crystalline transition region is observed to be enriched in certain dopant species and depleted of others as compared to the interior of the amorphous complexions. This chemical patterning can be explained in terms of the elemental preference for ordered or disordered grain boundary environments. As only a qualitative measure of structural short-range order can be obtained with nanobeam electron diffraction for these specimens, atomistic simulations with a custom-built machine learning interatomic potential are then used to probe how dopant patterning affects local structural state. Increased grain boundary chemical complexity is found to result in a more disordered complexion structure, with segregation to the amorphous-crystalline transition regions driving changes in local structure that are sensitive to dopant ratios. As a whole, the intimate connection between local chemistry and order in amorphous interfacial complexions is demonstrated, opening the door for microstructural engineering within the amorphous complexions themselves.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.06166v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Temperature and Pressure Dependent Vibrational Properties of Pristine and Doped Vacancy-Ordered Double Perovskite</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21810</link><description>arXiv:2512.21810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding lattice dynamics and structural transitions in vacancy-ordered double perovskites is crucial for developing lead-free optoelectronic materials, yet the role of dopants in modulatingthese properties remains poorly understood. We investigate the vibrational and optical properties of pristine and Antimony(Sb)-doped Cs$_2$TiCl$_6$ vacancy-ordered double perovskite through temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy (4-273 K), high-pressure studies (0- \~30 GPa), ambient powder XRD, and photoluminescence measurements. Sb doping improves phase purity, reducing impurity-related Raman modes present in pristine samples. Most notably, Sb-doped samples exhibit an anomalous Raman mode M$_1$ appearing exclusively below 100 K at 314-319 cm$^{-1}$, accompanied by changes in the temperature coefficient $\chi$ and anharmonic constant $A$ across this threshold. This behavior is absent in pristine Cs$_2$TiCl$_6$. While these observations suggest possible structural changes at low temperature, the origin of the M$_1$ mode remains unclear and may arise from disorder-activated vibrations, symmetry breaking, or dopant-induced local distortions. Low-temperature structural characterization is needed to confirm the nature of this transition. Photoluminescence shows broad self-trapped exciton emission at 448 nm with broader FWHM in Sb-doped samples (164.73 nm) compared to Bi-doped samples (138.2 nm), consistent with enhanced structural disorder. High-pressure Raman measurements reveal continuous mode hardening to 30 GPa with no phase transitions. These results demonstrate that Sb doping modulates the vibrational properties of Cs$_2$TiCl$_6$, though further investigation is required to establish the underlying mechanisms.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21810v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Support Vector Machine Kernels as Quantum Propagators</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11153</link><description>arXiv:2502.11153v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Selecting optimal kernels for regression in physical systems remains a challenge, often relying on trial-and-error with standard functions. In this work, we establish a mathematical correspondence between support vector machine kernels and quantum propagators, demonstrating that kernel efficacy is determined by its spectral alignment with the system's Green's function. Based on this isomorphism, we propose a unified, physics-informed framework for kernel selection and design. For systems with known propagator forms, we derive analytical selection rules that map standard kernels to physical operators. For complex systems where the Green's function is analytically intractable, we introduce a constructive numerical method using the Kernel Polynomial Method with Jackson smoothing to generate custom, physics-aligned kernels. Numerical experiments spanning electrical conductivity, electronic band structure, anharmonic oscillators, and photonic crystals demonstrate that this framework consistently performs well as long as there is an alignment with a Green's function.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.11153v3</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Ternary Transition Metal Oxides for Electrochemical Energy Storage: Synthesis, Advantages, Design Strategies, and Future Prospects</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-2jncj-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Ternary transition metal oxides (TTMOs) have emerged as a new class of electrode materials for high-performance energy storage systems, particularly supercapacitors (SCs) and hybrid battery-capacitor devices. This comprehensive review aims to comprehensively survey recent advances in the design, synthesis, and analysis of TTMOs-based nanostructures for supercapacitor (SC) electrodes. It begins by outlining the key concepts related to charge storage mechanisms in SC electrodes, electric double-layer capacitance (EDL), pseudocapacitive (PC), and battery-type (BT) behavior, followed by a clarification of device configurations, including symmetric SC (SSC), asymmetric SC (ASC), and hybrid SC (HSC) devices. This review then examines the fabrication strategies for TTMOs, emphasizing the impact of synthetic approaches on material morphology, crystallinity, and electrochemical performance. Special attention is given to the structure-property relationships that govern ion transport and charge storage dynamics in these materials. The influence of morphological features, including dimensionality, porosity, and hierarchical architecture, on electrochemical behavior is critically analyzed. A comparative evaluation of electrochemical matrices across various TTMO electrodes is presented, highlighting key performance and challenges. Ultimately, the review highlights emerging trends, current limitations, and future research directions that are poised to accelerate the development of next-generation TTMO materials for advanced energy storage technologies.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-2jncj-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Tunable Gelation and Viscoelasticity of Lung-Tissue–Mimetic Sealant: Linking Shear History to In Situ Mechanical Performance through Physics-Informed Machine Learning</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-zkrvp?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Hydrogel-based lung sealants are optimized largely based on formulation and post-cure mechanics, even though deformation history during delivery and placement plays a critical, yet under-characterized, role in determining in situ performance. This disconnect is particularly consequential on the application of lung sealants, where excessive stiffness promotes delamination while insufficient stiffness compromises airtight sealing. Here, we establish a quantitative process–structure–property framework for a gelatin–tannic acid–transglutaminase lung-mimetic sealant by integrating time-resolved rheology with physics-informed machine learning.

Using small-amplitude oscillatory shear and steady torsional flow at 37 °C, we show that gelation follows a reproducible kinetic clock (storage modulus, G′– loss modulus, G″, crossover at ~100 s; modulus plateau by ~600 s), while the attainable viscoelastic state is strongly governed by deformation history. Increasing oscillatory strain amplitude from 0.1 % to 50 % suppresses network maturation, reducing the post-gelation storage modulus, G′,  from ~10⁶ to ~10⁴ Pa, whereas sustained steady shear (0.01–1 s⁻¹) decreases magnitude of complex viscosity by 2–3 orders of magnitude and permanently downshifts elastic moduli, G′–, from ≈3.5×10³ to ≈4×10² Pa. These modulus ranges span the effective compliance of lung parenchyma under physiological tidal strain, delineating mechanical regimes associated with airtight sealing, strain accommodation, or premature interfacial failure. Controlled aeration during the processing of the sealant further decreases stiffness by ~30 % without altering gelation kinetics, providing an additional, physically interpretable compliance-tuning mechanism.

To unify these effects, we introduce a dimensionless Degree of Gelation (DoG), serving as a rheological state variable that collapses oscillatory and steady-shear histories into a single, time-resolved descriptor of network evolution. Machine-learning models trained on experimentally accessible inputs (time, strain amplitude, shear rate, frequency, aeration) accurately predict DoG (R² ≈ 0.9) and, in inverse mode, identify handling conditions required to achieve targeted in situ mechanical states.

This rheology–machine-learning framework reframes lung sealant development from a static materials optimization problem to a controllable, process-driven design strategy. By quantitatively linking applicator-level parameters to failure-relevant mechanical outcomes—airtightness, compliance, and resistance to delamination—it provides a mechanistic and generalizable foundation for the design of injectable hydrogels, bioadhesives, and tissue-interfacing</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-zkrvp?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Discovery of β-Sheet Peptide Assembly Codes via an Experimentally Validated Predictive Computational Platform</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-4c5h0?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Deciphering the sequence codes governing ordered peptide assemblies remains challenging due to the need to explore vast sequence space with atomic resolution. Here, we present an experimentally validated computational framework combining hybrid-resolution molecular dynamics and machine learning for the discovery of β-sheet-rich amyloid-forming peptides. Through exhaustive simulations of all 8,000 tripeptides, we demonstrate that the widely used aggregation propensity (AP) is not effective in predicting β-sheet assembly. We introduce Amyloid-Like Tendency (ALT), a metric enabled by our hybrid-resolution simulations that effectively identifies cross-β architectures. Leveraging this physics-informed dataset, we further fine-tuned the Uni-Mol model to efficiently screen 160,000 tetrapeptides. Experimental validation of 46 candidates confirmed a predictive accuracy of ~85%, yielding 26 novel amyloid-forming peptides, including multiple hydrogelators. Mechanistic analysis reveals that specific sidechain stacking and central amino acid identity, beyond generic hydrophobicity, dictate ordered assembly. This establishes a scalable pipeline for the targeted design of functional peptide materials.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-4c5h0?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Continued Challenges in High-Throughput Materials Predictions: MatterGen predicts compounds from the training dataset.</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-mkls8-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>High-throughput computational tools and generative AI models aim to revolutionise materials discovery by enabling the rapid prediction of novel inorganic compounds. However, these tools face persistent challenges with modelling compounds where multiple elements occupy the same crystallographic site, often leading to misclassification of known disordered phases as new ordered compounds. Recently, Microsoft revealed MatterGen as a tool for predicting new materials. As a proof of concept, MatterGen was used to predict the novel compound TaCr2O6, which was subsequently synthesised in a disordered form as Ta1/3Cr2/3O2. However, detailed crystallographic analysis, presented in this paper, reveals that this is not a novel compound but is identical to the already known compound Ta1/2Cr1/2O2 reported in 1972 and actually included in MatterGen’s training dataset. These findings underscore the necessity of rigorous human verification in AI-assisted materials research, limiting their use for rapid and large-scale prediction of new materials. While generative models hold great promise, their effectiveness is currently limited by unresolved issues with disorder prediction and dataset validation. Improved integration with crystallographic expertise is essential to realise their full potential.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-mkls8-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Pressure- and Temperature-Dependent Ionic Transport in Ag₄Zr₃S₈ Nanocrystal Pellets</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-t7qrx?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Nanocrystal (NC)–derived solid electrolytes provide access to compositionally complex and metastable ion conductors, yet their measured transport properties are often dominated by extrinsic contact effects.

Pressure-dependent Nyquist analysis shows impedance is overwhelmingly dominated by interfacial and constriction resistances, with pressure primarily reducing contact limitations rather than altering intrinsic ion transport. Temperature–pressure heat maps of the high-frequency resistance reveal thermally activated transport strongly modulated by mechanical contact and electrode compatibility. These results establish pressure-resolved impedance spectroscopy as a diagnostic framework for separating intrinsic and extrinsic transport contributions in NC-based solid electrolytes.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-t7qrx?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Mechanistic Evidence for Dibutyl Phthalate as an Environmental Trigger for Inflammatory Bowel Disease</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02880-9?rss=yes</link><description>Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) is a ubiquitous pollutant, but its molecular link to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is undefined. We employed an integrative network toxicology framework, combining DBP target databases with IBD patient transcriptomics to address this gap. A computational pipeline using machine learning and molecular docking predicted a core six-gene signature (KYNU, PCK1, LCN2, CDC25B, EPHB4, SORD). We validated these predictions in human colonic epithelial cells (NCM460). DBP exposure induced a pro-inflammatory state and upregulated the core genes, with LCN2 showing the strongest response.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02880-9?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Bidirectional optically modulated In 2 O 3  transistors with inorganic solid electrolyte gating for neuromorphic visual systems</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/1/013301/3376081/Bidirectional-optically-modulated-In2O3</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Inspired by retinal visual processing, we demonstrate a bidirectional optically controlled neuromorphic In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; transistor based on an inorganic solid electrolyte Li&lt;sub&gt;1+x&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;2-x&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (LATP) gate dielectric. The device exhibits light-controlled bidirectional visual bipolar cell behavior, exhibiting excitatory and inhibitory responses under ultraviolet (275 nm) and green light (520 nm) stimuli, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and capacitance–frequency measurements reveal that mobile Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions in the LATP dielectric layer can adsorb electrons and form Coulombic binding states, thereby dynamically modulating photogenerated carrier transport. Optical pulse trains dynamically regulate the channel current, enabling bidirectional optical neural plasticity. Furthermore, a large-area device array was employed for image encoding and retinal damage simulation, highlighting its potential for artificial vision and neuromorphic computing. These findings establish an effective strategy for developing bidirectional optical, reconfigurable, and large-scale integrable neuromorphic devices, providing additional insights into the role of dielectric layer ion dynamics in neuromorphic optoelectronics.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/1/013301/3376081/Bidirectional-optically-modulated-In2O3</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Elimination of wing tilt laterally overgrown GaN</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/1/011903/3376334/Elimination-of-wing-tilt-laterally-overgrown-GaN</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Wing tilt and associated defects at the coalescence boundary in GaN were completely eliminated in a maskless homoepitaxial overgrowth process, whereas SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-masked homoepitaxial overgrowth showed the same effects as samples grown on sapphire or SiC. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy were used to investigate the structures and defect behavior in the epitaxial layers. Crystallographic tilt and the generation of new dislocations with &lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt;-type Burgers vectors were observed in the SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-masked sample, consistent with the wing tilt phenomenon, while high crystal quality and dislocation-free layers were grown in the maskless process. This shows that the mask is the primary cause for tilt and dislocations during overgrowth, while lattice and thermal mismatch have a contributing but smaller role.

In this study, an irradiation-hardened quasi-vertical GaN PiN diode with a beveled-mesa termination structure is fabricated, exhibiting only an 8% reduction in blocking voltage under 1.3 GeV Ta ion irradiation with a high fluence of ∼10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; ions/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This robustness enables in-depth analysis of electrical degradation under the synergistic effects of irradiation and bias voltage. Forward &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;–&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;V&lt;/span&gt; analysis reveals reductions in minority carrier lifetime, mobility, and diffusion length. Temperature-dependent reverse &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;I–V&lt;/span&gt; characteristics show an upward shift in the transition voltage from variable range hopping leakage to space-charge-limited current conduction in irradiated devices, with additional involvement of trap-assisted Poole–Frenkel emission. deep-level transient spectroscopy identifies a shallow trap E2 (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; − 0.1 eV) and two deep traps, E1 (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; − 0.43 eV) and H1 (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;v + 0.68 eV). E1 exhibits a twofold increase in trap density post-irradiation and is attributed to dislocation-related defects or Ga vacancies. H1 likely originates from dissociation of Mg–H complexes under irradiation, forming Mg&lt;sub&gt;Ga&lt;/sub&gt; and related complexes such as Mg&lt;sub&gt;Ga&lt;/sub&gt;-V&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;. These traps, driven by the high electronic energy loss, could introduce localized recombination centers and scattering sites. These results offer critical insights into the irradiation-induced degradation mechanisms and design strategies for GaN-based power diodes (e.g., PiN diodes and Schottky diodes) and high electron mobility transistors in aerospace electronic systems.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/1/012101/3376084/Trap-induced-degradation-mechanisms-in-quasi</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] A data-driven approach to control stimulus responsivity of functional polymer materials: Predicting thermoresponsive color-change properties of polydiacetylene</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00442J</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, Accepted Manuscript&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00442J, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Risako Shibata, Nano Shioda, Hiroaki Imai, Yasuhiko Igarashi, Yuya Oaki&lt;br /&gt;Sensing devices are fabricated using stimuli-responsive materials.

Here, Wedal et al. synthesize Mn catalysts containing pincer ligands with an additional hemilabile donor designed to prevent catalyst decomposition. These complexes give excellent turnover numbers, turnover frequencies, and lifetimes for CO2 hydrogenation to formate. Catalytic performance is related to the binding strength of the hemilabile donor, which cannot be too strong or too weak. This work provides principles for designing catalysts for a variety of applications.</description><author>Chem</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/chem/fulltext/S2451-9294(25)00424-3?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] PGLa and Magainin 2 Can Porate Membranes via Transient Hourglass-Shaped Toroidal Pores</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c11101</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c11101/asset/images/medium/ja5c11101_0007.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c11101&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 19:11:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c11101</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Expanded Boraporphyrinoids: Boron Macrocycles with Redox Switchable Magnetic (Anti)aromaticity and Strong Near-Infrared Absorption</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c18822</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c18822/asset/images/medium/ja5c18822_0011.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c18822&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 19:10:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c18822</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Structural Mechanism for Gas Permeability in Noncrystalline Carbon under Pressure</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c17051</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c17051/asset/images/medium/ja5c17051_0005.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c17051&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 18:42:01 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c17051</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Acta Materialia] Dual Engine-driven Strategy for Advanced Copper Alloy Design employing Large Language Models</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359645425011735?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: Available online 3 January 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;

Li-Argyrodite (Li6PS5Cl) is a promising SSE with high ionic conductivity, produced using cheap and sustainable precursors, and therefore of interest to both academia and industry. Like many other sulfide-based SSEs, it is however unstable against Li-metal. Using ab-initio and machine-learning methods, we simulate three representative Li-metal/Li-Argyrodite interface models to investigate whether the exact surface termination affects the chemical stability and ion transport capability. We present a systematic approach to create low-energy interfaces by screening 28 low Miller-index surface terminations of Li-argyrodite and coupling them with Li-metal. Custom-made machine-learned interatomic potentials trained on ab-initio data enable the simulation of large interface models with over 2000 atoms for 5 ns. We find that all three interfaces decompose into an amorphous solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, consisting of Li3P, Li2S and LiCl, which then crystallizes into an antifluorite phase Li2S{1-x-y}P{x}Cl{y}; {x,y = 0.14-0.15}. A two orders of magnitude decrease in Li-ion flux shows that the crystalline SEI layer is a sluggish ion conductor, similar to Li2S. While all three interfaces form the same crystalline SEI layer, the exact rates of the decomposition and crystallisation depend on the actual surface composition. These atomic-level insights could potentially be used to control the SEI formation in sulphide-based SSEs and others.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-5d9nq?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Cellulose Coating Altered the Electro-Chemo-Mechanical Evolution of Sodium Thioantimonate Electrolyte in Solid-state Sodium Batteries: An Operando Raman Study</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-bwt22?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>All-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) attracted increasing attention due to their improved safety and energy densities; yet electrolyte decomposition and subsequent contact loss limited the interfacial stability of ASSBs. Herein, we report an operando Raman characterization that provides high voltage, time, and spatial resolutions, which enables simultaneous analysis of interfacial decomposition mechanism and morphological evolution. Using Na3SbS4 electrolyte (NSS) and its carboxymethyl-cellulose-encapsulated analogue (NSS-CMC) as exemplars, we precisely contrasted the subtle differences in the two-step reduction mechanism of the two electrolytes. In both systems, Na3SbS3 formed as an intermediate, and Na3Sb binary as one major final product; while the CMC coating altered the kinetics of Na3SbS3 formation and consumption, and extended the formation potential of Na3Sb from 1.35 V (seen in NSS) to 0.50 V (vs. Na/Na+). Oxidation of NSS and NSS-CMC both occur near 2.20 V, although CMC coating altered the crystallinity of the oxidative products. Simultaneously, we captured phenomena that are unique to solid-state electrochemical systems such as particle relocation, morphological change, and reversed reactions. We inferred CMC’s dual role as a voltage barrier and a mechanical buffer in suppressing the electro-chemo-mechanical decomposition of NSS electrolyte. The deep mechanistic insights unravel the exact modification needed for improved interfacial stability.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-bwt22?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Ensemble Transformer with Post-hoc Explanations for Depression Emotion and Severity Detection</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02866-4?rss=yes</link><description>This study presents an ensemble transformer framework for detecting depression-related emotions and classifying their severity in social media text. It addresses the need for scalable and trustworthy AI solutions in mental health by integrating four transformer models. The DepTformer-XAI-SV model uses a weighted soft-voting mechanism based on validation macro-F1 scores to improve accuracy and incorporates LIME to highlight key linguistic features associated with depression. The framework is evaluated on two benchmark datasets: DepressionEmo, with eight emotion classes, and the Merged Depression Severity Detection (MDSD), with four severity levels, both sourced from social media.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02866-4?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Computation-Guided Placement of Nonfullerene Acceptor Core Halogenation for High-Performance Organic Solar Cells</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c16058</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c16058/asset/images/medium/ja5c16058_0007.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c16058&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 14:07:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c16058</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Artificial Intelligence Chemistry] Accelerated green material and solvent discovery with chemistry- and physics-guided generative AI</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949747725000235?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: Available online 2 January 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Artificial Intelligence Chemistry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Eslam G.

The traditional approach often led to redundant engineering effort, high costs, and opaque systems that limit reproducibility, independent scrutiny, and scientific independence.  

This perspective advocates for permissively licensed open source software as a scientific and economic multiplier by reducing the duplication of effort, enabling scientific validation of modeling tools, and frictionless experimentation with new ideas. Coordinated, multi-project consortia, such as Open Force Field, Open Free Energy, OpenFold, and OpenADMET have formed to collaboratively build shared computational infrastructure and release all methods under permissive licenses. The success of these large-scale efforts requires organizational structures that extend beyond code. The Open Molecular Software Foundation (OMSF), a US nonprofit, serves as a domain-specific institutional home and fiscal sponsor. By providing governance, administrative infrastructure, and dedicated research software engineers, OMSF aligns incentives across academic and industrial stakeholders. This framework enables a synergistic ecosystem where projects interoperate to accelerate innovation, eliminate duplication, and ensure long-term software sustainability, thereby creating durable foundations that elevate the entire molecular modeling community.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid

Here we report a full enumeration and computational exploration of this space. Density functional theory-based geometry optimisation and energy calculations have identified all stable molecules within this space, forming a new database called CHX8. A universal strain value has been proposed and assigned to each of these molecules, acting as a proxy for synthesisability and providing a clear guideline of how synthetically plausible these molecules could be. This paper explores the limits of chemical space with CHX8, with a focus on trans-fused, unsaturated and anti-Bredt ring systems. We show that, contrary to prevailing wisdom, most of these unconventional structures should be synthetically accessible, with relative strain energies less than that of cubane. It is expected that this dataset will inspire the synthesis of many new molecules with applications in various areas of chemistry, biology and materials science. The resulting dataset also provides a valuable resource for the development of general and robust machine learning models.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-qjr5r?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] A round-robin exercise for the precise prediction of aqueous solubility of organic chemicals using chemometric, machine learning, and stacking ensemble of deep learning models</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-6xb6k?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Aqueous solubility is an important property for assessing the druggability and ecotoxicological effects of molecules. Successful drug candidates should have optimal aqueous solubility to improve bioavailability to target tissues. To effectively screen molecules in a short period of time, reliable predictive models are highly useful. In the present study, we conducted a round-robin exercise using a large, curated dataset of over 6000 compounds to predict aqueous solubility quantitatively. The six participating groups used an array of Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms to develop models with strong robustness and external predictive performance. All the models underwent rigorous Leave-One-Out and 10-fold cross-validation. The diversity of training sets and descriptor types used by different groups paved the way for exploring the mechanistic basis for the efficient identification of contributing features. The best-performing model was selected using the statistical Sum of Ranking Differences (SRD) approach, considering the performances on training, cross-validation, and test, as well as the performance difference between the training and test sets. Additionally, a curated, true external set was screened by the six different models. Here, the best-performing model was selected using a consensus ranking strategy based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R_Ext^2. In both approaches, i.e., the inherent model performance in terms of training, test, and cross-validation statistics, and the ability of the model to efficiently predict true external data, the Stacking Ensemble of Deep q-RASPR model emerged as the winner. This model showed comparable predictive performance to the previously reported model, which apparently lacked a proper data curation workflow and contained a significant number of duplicates and mixtures in its dataset, which can inflate model statistics. The insights from the different feature contributions from the different groups identified the useful structural and physicochemical aspects, which can help synthetic chemists to optimize molecules.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-6xb6k?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Joule] Seeing the unseen: Real-time tracking of battery cycling-to-failure via surface strain</title><link>https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00453-2?rss=yes</link><description>This study proposes a strain-based approach to address passive failures in lithium-ion batteries, which present spontaneous safety risks often indistinguishable from routine degradation using conventional diagnostics. By establishing a strain-failure correlation, we introduce a slope-based threshold and a failure-proximity index to characterize degradation-to-failure transitions. Incorporating strain-informed machine learning, it effectively detects early failure onset and estimates proximity. This scalable approach is suitable for real-time, onboard monitoring, supporting safer and more reliable battery operation.</description><author>Joule</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00453-2?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] AI-Driven Robotic Crystal Explorer for Rapid Polymorph Identification</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00203F</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, Accepted Manuscript&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00203F, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY-NC.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Lee Cronin, Daniel Salley, Edward Lee, Abhishek Sharma&lt;br /&gt;Crystallisation is an important phenomenon which facilitates the purification as well as structural and bulk phase material characterisation using crystallographic methods.

The results suggested that new-generation ALK inhibitors were associated with a significantly reduced risk of all-grade ALT elevation (RR=0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] (0.58, 0.92)) and a trend toward reduced risk of grade 3–5 ALT elevation (RR=0.55, 95%CI (0.29, 1.06)).</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02874-3?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Computational Elucidation of the Mechanism by which a Pericyclase Controls Periselectivity in the Biosynthesis of Natural Product (−)-PF-1018</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c20844</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c20844/asset/images/medium/ja5c20844_0006.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c20844&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 20:37:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c20844</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Geminal Cl-Bridged Dual-Fe-Atom Catalyst for Efficient and Stable Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c15456</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c15456/asset/images/medium/ja5c15456_0006.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c15456&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 19:59:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c15456</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Transient Imaging of the Oxygen Reduction Reaction at Single Nanocatalysts</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c18188</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c18188/asset/images/medium/ja5c18188_0005.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c18188&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 19:58:41 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c18188</guid></item><item><title>[ACS Energy Letters: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Understanding and Mitigating Lithium Metal Anode Failure in All-Solid-State Batteries with Inorganic Solid Electrolytes</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03333</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03333/asset/images/medium/nz5c03333_0006.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Energy Letters&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03333&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>ACS Energy Letters: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 18:39:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03333</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Computational Materials Science] Accelerating the search for superconductors using machine learning</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927025625007967?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: February 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Computational Materials Science, Volume 263&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Suhas Adiga, Umesh V.

Abstract: Altermagnetism is a newly discovered fundamental form of magnetic order, distinct from conventional ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. It uniquely exhibits no net magnetization while simultaneously breaking time-reversal symmetry, a combination previously thought to be mutually exclusive. Although its existence and signatures in momentum space have been established, the direct real-space visualization of its defining rotational symmetry breaking has remained a missing cornerstone. Here, using scanning tunnelling microscopy, we present atomic-scale imaging of electronic states in the candidate material CsV2Se2O. We directly visualize the hallmark symmetry breaking in the form of unidirectional electronic patterns tied to magnetic domain walls and spin defects, as well as elliptical charging rings surrounding those defects. These observed electronic states are all linked to the underlying alternating spin texture. Our work provides the foundational real-space evidence for altermagnetism, moving the field from theoretical and momentum-space probes to direct visual confirmation; thereby opening a path to explore how this unconventional magnetic order couples to and controls other quantum electronic states.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24114v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Insights Into Radiation Damage in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ From Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24430</link><description>arXiv:2512.24430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of radiation damage in YBa$_2$Cu$3$O${7-\delta}$ (YBCO) is essential for assessing the performance of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tapes in compact fusion reactors. Existing empirical interatomic potentials have been used to model radiation damage in stoichiometric YBCO, but fail to describe oxygen-deficient compositions, which are ubiquitous in industrial Rare-Earth Barium Copper Oxide conductors and strongly influence superconducting properties. In this work, we demonstrate that modern machine-learned interatomic potentials enable predictive modelling of radiation damage in YBCO across a wide range of oxygen stoichiometries, with higher fidelity than previous empirical models. We employ two recently developed approaches: an Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) potential and a tabulated Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP). Both models accurately reproduce Density Functional Theory (DFT) energies, forces, and threshold displacement energy distributions, providing a reliable description of atomic-scale collision processes. Molecular dynamics simulations of 5 keV cascades predict enhanced peak defect production and recombination relative to a widely used empirical potential, indicating different cascade evolution. By explicitly varying oxygen deficiency, we show that total defect production depends only weakly on stoichiometry, offering insight into the robustness of radiation damage processes in oxygen-deficient YBCO. Finally, fusion-relevant 300 keV cascade simulations reveal amorphous regions with dimensions comparable to the superconducting coherence length, consistent with electron microscopy observations of neutron-irradiated HTS tapes. These results establish machine-learned interatomic potentials as efficient and predictive tools for investigating radiation damage in YBCO across relevant compositions and irradiation conditions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24430v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Upscaling from ab initio atomistic simulations to electrode scale: The case of manganese hexacyanoferrate, a cathode material for Na-ion batteries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24816</link><description>arXiv:2512.24816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generalizable scale-bridging computational framework that enables predictive modeling of insertion-type electrode materials from atomistic to device scales. Applied to sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate, a promising cathode material for grid-scale sodium-ion batteries, our methodology employs an active-learning strategy to train a Moment Tensor Potential through iterative hybrid grand-canonical Monte Carlo--molecular dynamics sampling, robustly capturing configuration spaces at all sodiation levels. The resulting machine learning interatomic potential accurately reproduces experimental properties including volume expansion, operating voltage, and sodium concentration-dependent structural transformations, while revealing a four-order-of-magnitude difference in sodium diffusivity between the rhombohedral (sodium-rich) and tetragonal (sodium-poor) phases at 300 K. We directly compute all critical parameters -- temperature- and concentration-dependent diffusivities, interfacial and strain energies, and complete free-energy landscapes -- to feed them into pseudo-2D phase-field simulations that predict phase-boundary propagation and rate-dependent performances across electrode length scales. This multiscale workflow establishes a blueprint for rational computational design of next-generation insertion-type materials, such as battery electrode materials, demonstrating how atomistic insights can be systematically translated into continuum-scale predictions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24816v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] SSCHA-based evolutionary crystal structure prediction at finite temperatures with account for quantum nuclear motion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24849</link><description>arXiv:2512.24849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate crystal structure prediction (CSP) at finite temperatures with quantum anharmonic effects remains challenging but very prominent in systems with lightweight atoms such as superconducting hydrides. In this work, we integrate machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) with the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA) to enable evolutionary CSP on the quantum anharmonic free-energy landscape. Using LaH$_{10}$ at 150 GPa and 300 K as a test case, we compare two approaches for SSCHA-based CSP: using light-weight active-learning MLIPs (AL-MLIPs) trained on-the-fly from scratch, and foundation models or universal MLIPs (uMLIPs) from the Matbench project. We demonstrate that AL-MLIPs allow to correctly predict the experimentally known cubic Fm$\bar{3}$m phase as the most stable polymorph at 150 GPa but require corrections within the thermodynamic perturbation theory to get consistent results. The uMLIP Mattersim-5m allow to conduct SSCHA-based CSP without requiring per-structure training and even get correct structure ranking near the global minimum, though fine-tuning may be needed for higher accuracy. Our results show that including quantum anharmonicity simplifies the free-energy landscape and is essential for correct stability rankings, that is especially important for high-temperature phases that could be missed in classical 0 K CSP. The proposed approach extends the reach of CSP to systems where quantum nuclear motion and anharmonicity dominate.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24849v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Large language models and the entropy of English</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24969</link><description>arXiv:2512.24969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use large language models (LLMs) to uncover long-ranged structure in English texts from a variety of sources. The conditional entropy or code length in many cases continues to decrease with context length at least to $N\sim 10^4$ characters, implying that there are direct dependencies or interactions across these distances. A corollary is that there are small but significant correlations between characters at these separations, as we show from the data independent of models. The distribution of code lengths reveals an emergent certainty about an increasing fraction of characters at large $N$. Over the course of model training, we observe different dynamics at long and short context lengths, suggesting that long-ranged structure is learned only gradually. Our results constrain efforts to build statistical physics models of LLMs or language itself.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24969v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Emergence of 3D Superconformal Ising Criticality on the Fuzzy Sphere</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25054</link><description>arXiv:2512.25054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersymmetric conformal field theories (SCFTs) form a unique subset of quantum field theories which provide powerful insights into strongly coupled critical phenomena. Here, we present a microscopic and non-perturbative realization of the three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal Ising critical point, based on a Yukawa-type coupling between a 3D Ising CFT and a gauged Majorana fermion. Using the recently developed fuzzy sphere regularization, we directly extract the scaling dimensions of low-lying operators via the state-operator correspondence. At the critical point, we demonstrate conformal multiplet structure together with the hallmark of emergent spacetime supersymmetry through characteristic relations between fermionic and bosonic operators. Moreover, by tuning the Yukawa coupling, we explicitly track the evolution of operator spectra from the decoupled Ising-Majorana fixed point to the interacting superconformal fixed point, revealing renormalization-group flow at the operator level. Our results establish a controlled, non-perturbative microscopic route to 3D SCFTs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.25054v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Learning Density Functionals to Bridge Particle and Continuum Scales</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23840</link><description>arXiv:2512.23840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting interfacial thermodynamics across molecular and continuum scales remains a central challenge in computational science. Classical density functional theory (cDFT) provides a first-principles route to connect microscopic interactions with macroscopic observables, but its predictive accuracy depends on approximate free-energy functionals that are difficult to generalize. Here we introduce a physics-informed learning framework that augments cDFT with neural corrections trained directly against molecular-dynamics data through adjoint optimization. Rather than replacing the theory with a black-box surrogate, we embed compact neural networks within the Helmholtz free-energy functional, learning local and nonlocal corrections that preserve thermodynamic consistency while capturing missing correlations. Applied to Lennard-Jones fluids, the resulting augmented excess free-energy functional quantitatively reproduces equilibrium density profiles, coexistence curves, and surface tensions across a broad temperature range, and accurately predicts contact angles and droplet shapes far beyond the training regime. This approach combines the interpretability of statistical mechanics with the adaptability of modern machine learning, establishing a general route to learned thermodynamic functionals that bridge molecular simulations and continuum-scale models.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23840v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] CASCADE: Cumulative Agentic Skill Creation through Autonomous Development and Evolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23880</link><description>arXiv:2512.23880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents currently depend on predefined tools or brittle tool generation, constraining their capability and adaptability to complex scientific tasks. We introduce CASCADE, a self-evolving agentic framework representing an early instantiation of the transition from "LLM + tool use" to "LLM + skill acquisition". CASCADE enables agents to master complex external tools and codify knowledge through two meta-skills: continuous learning via web search and code extraction, and self-reflection via introspection and knowledge graph exploration, among others. We evaluate CASCADE on SciSkillBench, a benchmark of 116 materials science and chemistry research tasks. CASCADE achieves a 93.3% success rate using GPT-5, compared to 35.4% without evolution mechanisms. We further demonstrate real-world applications in computational analysis, autonomous laboratory experiments, and selective reproduction of published papers. Along with human-agent collaboration and memory consolidation, CASCADE accumulates executable skills that can be shared across agents and scientists, moving toward scalable AI-assisted scientific research.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23880v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Assessment of First-Principles Methods in Modeling the Melting Properties of Water</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23940</link><description>arXiv:2512.23940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-principles simulations have played a crucial role in deepening our understanding of the thermodynamic properties of water, and machine learning potentials (MLPs) trained on these first-principles data widen the range of accessible properties. However, the capabilities of different first-principles methods are not yet fully understood due to the lack of systematic benchmarks, the underestimation of the uncertainties introduced by MLPs, and the neglect of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs). Here, we systematically assess first-principles methods by calculating key melting properties using path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) driven by Deep Potential (DP) models trained on data from density functional theory (DFT) with SCAN, revPBE0-D3, SCAN0 and revPBE-D3 functionals, as well as from the MB-pol potential. We find that MB-pol is in qualitatively good agreement with the experiment in all properties tested, whereas the four DFT functionals incorrectly predict that NQEs increase the melting temperature. SCAN and SCAN0 slightly underestimate the density change between water and ice upon melting, but revPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 severely underestimate it. Moreover, SCAN and SCAN0 correctly predict that the maximum liquid density occurs at a temperature higher than the melting point, while revPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 predict the opposite behavior. Our results highlight limitations in widely used first-principles methods and call for a reassessment of their predictive power in aqueous systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23940v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Testing Noise Correlations by an AI-Assisted Two-Qubit Quantum Sensor</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24135</link><description>arXiv:2512.24135v1 Announce Type: cross

Abstract: Floquet engineering offers an unparalleled platform for realizing novel non-equilibrium topological phases. However, the unique structure of Floquet systems, which includes multiple quasienergy gaps, poses a significant challenge to classification using conventional analytical methods. We propose a novel unsupervised machine learning framework that employs a kernel defined in momentum-time ($\boldsymbol{k},t$) space, constructed directly from Floquet-Bloch eigenstates. This approach is intrinsically data-driven and requires no prior knowledge of the underlying topological invariants, providing a fundamental advantage over prior methods that rely on abstract concepts like the micromotion operator or homotopic transformations. Crucially, this work successfully reveals the intrinsic topological characteristics encoded within the Floquet eigenstates themselves. We demonstrate that our method robustly and simultaneously identifies the topological invariants associated with both the $0$-gap and the $\pi$-gap across various symmetry classes (1D AIII, 1D D, and 2D A), establishing a robust methodology for the systematic classification and discovery of complex non-equilibrium topological matter.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24822v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dynamic breaking of axial symmetry of acoustic waves in crystals as the origin of nonlinear elasticity and chaos: Analytical model and MD simulations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04175</link><description>arXiv:2510.04175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Chain of Springs and Masses (CSM) model is used in the interpretation of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of movement of atoms in orientated FCC crystals. A force of dynamic origin is found that is perpendicular to the direction of the external shear pressure. It is proportional to the square of the applied pressure; It causes breaking of axial symmetry for propagation of transverse acoustic waves. It leads to a non-linear elastic response of crystals and to chaotic patterns in the motion of atoms. We provide an analytical derivation of an effective atomistic 3D potential for interaction between crystallographic layers. The potential is found to possess a component that has an anharmonic threefold axial symmetry around one direction. It reduces to the H{\'e}non-Heinen potential in a 2D cross-section, leading to mathematically rich, complex dynamic features. Results of simulation predict displacements of atoms that are inconsistent with the static theory of elasticity that may have been overlooked in experiments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.04175v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] GoodRegressor: A General-Purpose Symbolic Regression Framework for Physically Interpretable Materials Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18325</link><description>arXiv:2510.18325v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symbolic regression offers a promising route toward interpretable machine learning, yet existing methods suffer from poor predictability and computational intractability when exploring large expression spaces. I introduce GoodRegressor, a general-purpose C++-based framework that resolves these limitations while preserving full physical interpretability. By combining hierarchical descriptor construction, interaction discovery, nonlinear transformations, statistically rigorous model selection, and stacking ensemble, GoodRegressor efficiently explores symbolic model spaces such as $1.44 \times 10^{457}$, $5.99 \times 10^{124}$, and $4.20 \times 10^{430}$ possible expressions for oxygen-ion conductors, NASICONs, and superconducting oxides, respectively. Across these systems, it produces compact equations that surpass state-of-the-art black-box models and symbolic regressors, improving $R^2$ by $4 \sim 40$ %. The resulting expressions reveal physical insights, for example, into oxygen-ion transport through coordination environment and lattice flexibility. Independent ensemble runs yield nearly identical regressed values and the identical top-ranked candidate, demonstrating high reproducibility. With scalability up to $10^{4392}$ choices without interaction terms, GoodRegressor provides a foundation for general-purpose interpretable machine intelligence.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.18325v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Thermodynamic Phase Stability, Structural, Mechanical, Optoelectronic, and Thermoelectric Properties of the III-V Semiconductor AlSb for Energy Conversion Applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22277</link><description>arXiv:2512.22277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a first principles investigation of the structural, thermodynamic, electronic, optical and thermoelectric properties of aluminum antimonide (AlSb) in its cubic (F-43m) and hexagonal (P63mc) phases. Both structures are dynamically and mechanically stable, as confirmed by phonon calculations and the Born Huang criteria. The lattice constants obtained using the SCAN and PBEsol functionals show good agreement with experimental data. The cubic phase exhibits a direct band gap of 1.66 to 1.78 eV, while the hexagonal phase shows a band gap of 1.48 to 1.59 eV, as confirmed by mBJ and HSE06 calculations. Under external pressure, the band gap decreases in the cubic phase and increases in the hexagonal phase due to different s p orbital hybridization mechanisms. The optical absorption coefficient reaches 1e6 cm-1, which is comparable to or higher than values reported for other III V semiconductors. The Seebeck coefficient exceeds 1500 microV per K under intrinsic conditions, and the thermoelectric performance improves above 600 K due to enhanced phonon scattering and lattice anharmonicity. The calculated formation energies (-1.316 eV for F-43m and -1.258 eV for P63mc) confirm that the cubic phase is thermodynamically more stable. The hexagonal phase exhibits higher anisotropy and lower lattice stiffness, which is favorable for thermoelectric applications. These results demonstrate the strong interplay between crystal symmetry, phonon behavior and charge transport, and provide useful guidance for the design of AlSb based materials for optoelectronic and energy conversion technologies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22277v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] CrystalDiT: A Diffusion Transformer for Crystal Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16614</link><description>arXiv:2508.16614v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present CrystalDiT, a diffusion transformer for crystal structure generation that achieves state-of-the-art performance by challenging the trend of architectural complexity. Instead of intricate, multi-stream designs, CrystalDiT employs a unified transformer that imposes a powerful inductive bias: treating lattice and atomic properties as a single, interdependent system. Combined with a periodic table-based atomic representation and a balanced training strategy, our approach achieves 8.78% SUN (Stable, Unique, Novel) rate on MP-20, substantially outperforming recent methods including FlowMM (4.21%) and MatterGen (3.66%). Notably, CrystalDiT generates 63.28% unique and novel structures while maintaining comparable stability rates, demonstrating that architectural simplicity can be more effective than complexity for materials discovery.

It implies numerous proteins and complex molecular mechanisms. The TRIP12 E3 ubiquitin ligase is tightly associated to chromatin and overexpressed in several types of cancers. We explored herein the consequences of TRIP12 overexpression on chromatin homeostasis. We demonstrated that TRIP12 overexpression leads, in a dose-dependent manner, to the formation of chromatin condensates enriched in heterochromatin marks. We delineated within the N-terminal intrinsically disordered region of TRIP12 the region required for condensate formation that involves electrostatic interactions.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid

Anion Exchange Membranes for Water 
Electrolysis to Generate Green Hydrogen</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-5jcw1?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Anion exchange membranes (AEMs) have received a lot of attention in electrochemical energy storage 
and conversion systems and have become a better choice to generate green hydrogen than their proton 
exchange membrane counterparts owing to the non-acidic working conditions as well as the use of nonprecious metal catalytic electrodes. Albeit the safe operating conditions as well as the use of non-precious 
metals, the ion conductivity and technology readiness level of AEMs are significantly lower than their PEM 
counterparts. It is well accepted that the key factors that drive their performance are anion conductivity, 
water uptake and chemical stability. However, there exist several other parameters that influence not 
only the KPI’s but also the overall electrochemical performance of AEMs. The objective of this study is to 
compile the various physical processes in an anion exchange membrane water electrolyser and focus on 
the dominant ones that define the performance of these membranes. We further propose appropriate 
methods to predict the KPIs using multiscale approach. In this report, we elaborately discuss the abovementioned points with a note that, this area still requires substantial research and profound 
understanding from both experimental and computational point of view. In this article, a comprehensive 
review on molecular dynamics simulation methods for anion exchange membranes is extensively 
discussed. We also briefly touch upon the data analytics-based approaches to predict ion conductivity in these
membranes.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-5jcw1?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Revealing amyloid-β peptide isoforms, including post-translationally modified species, using electrochemical profiling with a dual-electrode set-up</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-j5v38?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides are crucial biomarkers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disease. The high diversity of the Aβ family provides a significant challenge for recognizing various Aβ forms, which may differ by a single amino acid or a post-translational modification. Such variation at the N-terminus of Aβ peptides leads to changes in their properties associated with typical AD biomolecular mechanisms, such as aggregation or generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this work, a novel method for discriminating Aβ peptides with physiologically occurring truncations and modifications at their N-termini, based on the electrochemical profiling of their Cu(II) complexes, is presented. A dual-electrode set-up incorporating both glassy carbon and gold electrodes, together with Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV), was employed to generate unique electrochemical profiles, which were subsequently analyzed using chemometric techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for data exploration, and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) for classification. By combining electrochemical measurements with machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition, we successfully differentiated the studied Aβ forms, Aβ1-16, Aβ3-16, Aβpyr3-16, Aβ4-16, Aβ5-16, Aβ11-16, and Aβpyr11-16. The integration of machine learning not only enhances detection accuracy but also identifies subtle patterns that could support early-stage diagnostics. These findings support the ongoing development of analytical strategies that seek to improve the detection range and accuracy of Aβ peptides identification in Alzheimer’s disease research.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-j5v38?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Sensing the Acidity of Hydrogen Bond Networks</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-twv66?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The reactivity of hydrogen bond networks (HBNs) is critical to many chemical and biological scenarios. When the HBNs are under constraint, hydrogen bond strength and acidity are affected significantly. HBNs exhibit cooperativity, where connections formed in one part of the HBN influence its behavior elsewhere. We combined experimental and computational approaches to examine the growth of the HBNs of water and hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), constrained by an aprotic cosolvent. We independently employed vibrational frequency shift of an acetonitrile probe, 1H NMR chemical shift of an aniline probe, and molecular dynamics with machine learning interatomic potentials, to demonstrate the increase in the hydrogen bond strength with the growth of the HBNs. Finally, using vibrational spectroscopy of a titratable probe, we established that not only the hydrogen bond strength, but also the acidity of HFIP is affected by the changes in the network geometry. These results enable the engineering and measurement of HBNs in confined environments with tailored acidity.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-twv66?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Thiol-bearing tertiary alkylammonium chloride for regulation of PbI2 excess in FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-0wscb-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>One of the key strategies for record photovoltaic efficiencies in metal halide perovskite solar cells is the addition of PbI2 excess in a stoichiometric perovskite solution which controls crystallization, passivates defects and induces a preferred orientation in the perovskite layer. However, residual PbI2, typically found in the perovskite layer after crystallization, generates non-radiative recombination centres and promotes ion migration under light and heating stress, thus accelerating performance loss. To mitigate the above issues, a common strategy is the post-deposition of organic ammonium salts which interact in situ with residual PbI2. Here, we adopt a multifunctional alkylammonium salt, 2-diethylaminoethanethiol hydrochloride (DEAET), in which both the thiol (–SH) and protonated tertiary amine groups can strongly bind to PbI₂. Upon deposition of DEAET on top of FAPbI3 film, we show that DEAT decreases the percentage of residual PbI2 by 40% and totally eliminates Pb0. These two effects lead to enhanced radiative recombination, proving a net passivation effect, while chemical analysis (FTIR and liquid-state NMR) explains that this is due to strong interactions between tertiary protonated ammonium (-NH+) and thiol (-SH) groups of DEAT with under-coordinated Pb2+. The stabilization of FAPbI3 black phase along with the establishment of a solid barrier to impede the infiltration of moisture into the perovskite layer over time lead to enhanced operational stability for the as-fabricated solar cells. The encouraging findings of this study lay the foundation for the utilization of tertiary ammonium thiol-based salts as efficient agents for interface engineering in perovskite solar cells.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-0wscb-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] LAMMPS-ANI: Large Scale Molecular Dynamics Simulations

potential energy surfaces for molecular systems with very high accuracy and extreme speedups compared
to reference quantum calculations, offering a powerful tool for studying complex chemical and biological
systems. This work presents the LAMMPS-ANI interface, which scales our ANI neural network potential
models for large systems, demonstrated with up to 100 million atoms across up to 128 NVIDIA A100
GPUs. The high performance of LAMMPS-ANI was achieved through a comprehensive code redesign,
in-depth performance profiling, and advanced GPU performance optimizations. Our benchmarks show
that ANI is 30 to 60 times faster than the state-of-the-art Allegro Model, emphasizing its speed and
efficiency. We highlight our work in large-scale molecular dynamics using ANI potentials, presenting
benchmark results for water boxes (up to 100 million atoms) and a solvated HIV capsid (44 million
atoms). We also present results for accurately simulating complex reaction processes at unprecedented
scales, such as methane combustion (300 thousand atoms) and early Earth chemistry experiment (228
thousand atoms) demonstrating the spontaneous formation of glycine.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-8v03m?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Cell Reports Physical Science] Hierarchical optimization of perovskite solar cell fabrication via step-by-step machine learning</title><link>https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-physical-science/fulltext/S2666-3864(25)00642-3?rss=yes</link><description>Pu et al. report a hierarchical multi-target Bayesian optimization (MTBO) framework that optimizes the electrospray deposition process for perovskite solar cells.

This work demonstrates end-to-end PIC design automation using large language models (LLMs), with the goal of achieving structurally valid rather than performance-qualified layouts. We compare seven reasoning LLMs using a testbench of 102 design descriptions that ranged from single devices to 112-component PICs. The success rate for single-device designs was up to 91%. For design queries with ≤15 components, o1, Gemini-2.5-pro, and Claude Opus 4 achieved the highest end-to-end pass@5 success rates of ∼57%, with Gemini-2.5-pro requiring the fewest output tokens and the lowest cost.

In this work, the phonon dynamics, carrier transport, and TE performance of the layered SmZnSbO compound are comprehensively evaluated using first-principles calculations, machine learning interatomic potentials, Boltzmann transport theory, and the two-channel model. The coexistence of weak interlayer van der Waals interactions, robust intralayer covalent bonding interactions, and rattling-like vibrations of Zn atoms synergistically induces significant lattice anharmonicity, resulting in a decreased lattice thermal conductivity (0.84 W/mK@900 K within the framework of the two-channel model) for the SmZnSbO compound. The natural quantum well architecture formed by the alternative conductive [Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; layer and the insulated [Sm&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; layer endows quasi-two-dimensional transport characteristics, enabling a high carrier mobility of 34.1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/Vs. Moreover, the multi-valley electronic band structure with an indirect bandgap of 0.80 eV simultaneously optimizes electrical conductivity (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;σ&lt;/span&gt;) and Seebeck coefficient (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;), resulting in an enhanced power factor. Benefiting from these synergistic features, the layered SmZnSbO compound achieves optimal dimensionless figures of merit (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;ZT&lt;/span&gt;s) of 1.47 and 1.40 for the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;-type and &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;-type doping circumstances at 900 K. The current work not only elucidates the thermal and electronic transport mechanisms for the SmZnSbO compound but also establishes a paradigm for designing high-efficiency layered oxide TE materials through combined strategies of quantum confinement, phonon engineering, and multi-valley band convergence.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/26/261902/3375853/Rattling-induced-anharmonicity-and-multi-valley</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Magneto-ionic control of perpendicular anisotropy in epitaxial Mn 4 N films</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/26/262405/3375847/Magneto-ionic-control-of-perpendicular-anisotropy</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;We report reversible control of the magnetism and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) in Mn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N thin films through solid-state magneto-ionic gating.

Through comprehensive first-principles thermodynamic calculations and hierarchical ion-transport algorithms, the phase stability, electrochemical stability, chemical stability, ionic transport, Li wettability, and mechanical properties of the candidate materials were systematically predicted and analyzed. Results indicate that the candidate coatings are thermodynamically stable at 0 K, with superior reduction stability against the lithium metal anode and good chemical compatibility with LLZO. Their Li-ion migration barriers are as low as 0.32 eV, enabling room-temperature ionic conductivity of approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; S/cm.

Routine alcohol-based cleaning can be impractical on high-touch optical surfaces due to damage risk and usability concerns. Here, we present a scalable approach to transparent, mechanically robust glass surfaces by embedding materials with &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;ad hoc&lt;/span&gt; functionality into surface glass nanoholes. We demonstrate the concept with copper nanodisks: copper is an established antimicrobial agent, but its wear susceptibility pose challenges for use on transparent displays. Our design shields the functional material from lateral wear while allowing ion diffusion for antimicrobial efficacy. Fabrication uses only wafer-compatible, lithography-free steps: thermal dewetting of a thin silver film to create a nanosized mask; inverting it to a polymer nanoholes mask by etching the silver nanoparticles; wet etching of the glass to form nanoholes; selective copper deposition inside these holes; and liftoff of excess material. The resulting surfaces exhibit mean transmission of 80%–85% in the 380–750 nm range with haze &amp;lt;1% and minimal color shift, compared to uncoated glass. Antimicrobial efficacy, assessed against &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/span&gt; OP50 under a modified U.S. EPA protocol, shows ≈99% bacterial reduction within one hour. Abrasion tests with a crockmeter simulating finger swipes confirm that the embedded copper remains intact, with no measurable change in optical performance. This embedded design provides a scalable route to integrate antimicrobial functionality into high-touch transparent systems while preserving optical clarity and wear resistance, with potential relevance for medical, consumer, and transportation interfaces.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Materials Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apm/article/13/12/121112/3375772/Lithography-free-fabrication-of-transparent</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Augmenting Large Language Models for Automated Discovery of f-Element Extractants</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-b1m2q-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Efficient separation of f-elements is a critical challenge for a wide range of emerging technologies. The chemical similarity among these elements makes the development of selective solvent extraction reagents both slow and difficult. Here, we present a quasi-autonomous, AI-enabled workflow for the design and computational screening of selective extractant ligands. Molecular design is guided by SAFE-MolGen, a large language model-based agentic system that leverages curated extraction data to propose new ligands and preliminarily rank their performance using a supervised machine learning model trained on experimental datasets to consider the impact of realistic experimental conditions. Promising human-approved ligands are then passed to a second automated pipeline that constructs three-dimensional metal-ligand complexes and performs quantum mechanical free energy calculations to directly assess metal selectivity. We demonstrate this approach for Am(III)/Eu(III) separations and report several newly designed ligands predicted to exhibit higher Am(III)/Eu(III) selectivity than the benchmark extractant CyMe4BTBP. This workflow accelerates computational exploration of the molecular space in this data-sparse field and provides a general strategy for the rapid generation and evaluation of novel lanthanide (Ln) and actinide (An) extractants.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-b1m2q-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

of solutes from dried drop stains offers a low-cost, scalable alternative to traditional chemical analysis, enabled by artificial intelligence and annotated image libraries. While recent advances in robotic droplet imaging have facilitated the collection of such datasets, experimental acquisition remains a key bottleneck. Here, we explore whether synthetic image generation can supplement or replace real data in the context of salt classification. Using Stable Diffusion with low-rank adaptation, we generate 133 000 synthetic images from as few as &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 1–128 experimental images per salt across seven common inorganic solutes. Synthetic images become visually indistinguishable from real ones for &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; ≥ 6; however, quantitative analysis based on 47 image metrics reveals subtle differences that vanish around &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 128. When used to train random forest, XGBoost, and multilayer perceptron (MLP) models, synthetic data alone achieve classification accuracies of up to 90% in some low-data regimes. Synthetic augmentation offers a powerful strategy for expanding training sets and enabling image-based chemical classification in data-scarce scenarios, even if it seldom outperforms models trained on real data. The realism of synthetic images also highlights the growing need for tools that detect AI-generated scientific images to ensure data integrity.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Machine Learning Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/aml/article/3/4/046112/3375778/Synthetic-images-from-generative-AI-for</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] An Interpretable Machine Learning Model for Predicting the Effectiveness of Low-Dose Methylprednisolone in Treating Long COVID: A Retrospective Study</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02835-4?rss=yes</link><description>Long COVID is a chronic, multisystem disease with limited response to conventional treatments. While low-dose methylprednisolone has shown effectiveness in some patients, individual responses vary, and accurate predictive tools are lacking. This retrospective study included 330 Long COVID patients who received low-dose methylprednisolone treatment across three hospitals. Patients were divided into training (n=202), test (n=33), and external validation sets (n=53, n=42). Using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression, 38 variables were analyzed to develop six machine learning models.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02835-4?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] River plastic hotspot detection from space</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02831-7?rss=yes</link><description>Plastic pollution threatens terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and rivers play a central role in transporting and retaining plastics across landscapes. Effective mitigation requires scalable methods to identify riverine plastic accumulation hotspots.

The microbiome is increasingly recognized as a key modulator of antiviral immunity but whether it shapes immune responses in upper airway remains uncharacterized. Detailed microbial profiles revealed that S. aureus complex abundance was the primary discriminating factor of microbial community in the NP and the enhanced abundance of S. aureus complex correlated with higher frequencies of CD4+, CD8+ tissue-resident memory T (TRM), and BRM cells.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02840-8?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Polarization-Diversity Backscatter Communication Based on Programmable Information Metasurface</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02838-X?rss=yes</link><description>Backscatter communication (BC) is a low-power technology that transmits data by reflecting ambient RF signals. Conventional BC, based on antenna impedance modulation, suffers from low data rates and poor interference resistance. Programmable information metasurface (IMS) offer a breakthrough by enabling precise wave control. This paper presents a PIN-diode-based IMS for polarization-diversity backscatter transmission. It performs full-space secondary modulation, converting horizontally polarized incident waves into ±45° polarized signals.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02838-X?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Synthetic zipper mediated pre-targeting system for Near-infrared photoimmunotherapy</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02819-6?rss=yes</link><description>Strategies have gained attraction in cancer diagnosis and therapy, particularly to overcome the limitations associated with direct targeting approaches in radioimmunotherapy and photoimmunotherapy. Here, we have introduced a synthetic zipper-mediated pre-targeting system for Near-infrared photoimmunotherapy (NIR-PIT) utilizing the IR700-conjugated Zip1-SNAP protein in combination with three scFv-ZIP2 fusion proteins targeting FOLR1, TROP2 and TF. In this two-step targeting approach, scFv-Zip2 proteins first bind to cancer-specific antigens, followed by hybridization with Zip1-SNAP-IR700 at cell surface via high-affinity zipper interaction.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid

Syndrome (LFS) is characterized by constitutional pathogenic TP53 mutation and increased risk of cancer development, including Sonic Hedgehog-activated medulloblastoma (SHH-MB). In LFS patients, radiation and DNA-damaging agents can exhibit lower efficiency and cause secondary malignancies. To identify efficacious, safe chemotherapeutic approaches for LFS-associated SHH-MB, 333 compounds were screened in in vitro TP53mut brain tumor cell lines. The combination of WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib and vinca alkaloid vincristine demonstrated the highest activity, which was validated in TP53mut SHH-MB patient-derived organoids.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02825-1?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Multiple groups of neurons in the superior colliculus convert value signals into saccadic vigor</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02824-X?rss=yes</link><description>Eye movements toward high-valued objects are executed with greater vigor. To test how neurons in the Superior Colliculus (SC), a subcortical structure that controls these movements, are modulated by value, we recorded four SC neuron subtypes while monkeys made saccades to objects previously associated with high or low reward volumes. High-value objects elicited greater activity in three neuron subtypes (visual, visuomotor, motor). Using a bootstrapping method, we identified three distinct activity phases: early visual response (EVIS), late visual response (LVIS), and pre-saccadic (PreSAC) motor response.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02824-X?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Database of Recurrent Mutations (DORM), an unbiased web resource to browse recurrent mutations in cancers</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02822-6?rss=yes</link><description>Existing cancer-associated variant databases contain biases arising from duplicate entries and the inclusion of targeted sequencing panels, which interfere with accurate estimation somatic mutation frequency in cancer cohorts. To address this, we developed the Database of Recurrent Mutations (DORM), a web resource derived exclusively from whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing data. By filtering out targeted screens and non-recurrent variants, our analysis reveals that mutation recurrence significantly correlates with oncogenic activity, loss of tumor suppressor function, and unfavorable patient prognosis.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid

In this study, we use pre- and post-season resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) to examine whether concussion during a season of football is related to changes in neurophysiology and whether any such changes are associated with clinical outcomes. Concussion was associated with increased aperiodic exponents in superior frontal cortices, indicating a relative reduction in cortical excitability, which accounted for effects on raw delta and gamma power and was associated with worse cognitive concerns across participants.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02836-6?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] CK1δ-Dependent SNAPIN Dysregulation Drives Lysosomal Failure in HIV-1 Vpr–Exposed Neurons: A Targetable Mechanism in HAND</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02805-6?rss=yes</link><description>HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND) persist in nearly 40% of virally suppressed individuals despite AntiRetroviral Therapy (ART). Lysosomal dysfunction has emerged as a key contributor to HAND pathogenesis, yet the molecular mechanisms linking chronic HIV exposure to impaired neuronal degradation remain incompletely defined. Here, we identify HIV-1 Viral Protein R (Vpr) as a driver of lysosomal acidification failure, clustering, and degradative impairment in neurons. We report Casein Kinase 1 delta (CK1δ) as a central mediator of this dysfunction, acting via phosphorylation of the adaptor protein SNAPIN.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec

We conducted a longitudinal cohort study with 5,838,833 participants enrolled between 2019 and 2021. Region-specific Cox models assessed long-term PM2.5 exposure and CVD incidence. A 1 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with a 0.5% higher CVD risk (HR: 1.005; 95% CI: 1.005–1.006). Moderate and high exposure levels corresponded to HRs of 1.280 (95% CI: 1.255–1.306) and 1.373 (95% CI: 1.340–1.406).</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 00:00:00

The transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel has been implicated in neurodegenerative processes, but its contribution to cognitive variation in PD remains unclear. This study aimed to determine whether TRPV1 genetic variants influence cognitive performance and whether these effects are moderated by PD status. Three TRPV1 polymorphisms (rs8065080, rs12936340, rs182637) were genotyped in 274 healthy controls and 127 individuals with PD.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02799-3?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Identity rather than 3D position informs splicing of rare introns in the human genome</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02793-2?rss=yes</link><description>Three-dimensional genome organization influences splicing, yet how introns, particularly rare introns, are arranged within the nucleus and whether this organization contributes to splicing has not been fully explored. We mapped the organization of six intron classes, major, minor, minor-like, hybrid, major-like and non-canonical, across four human cell lines using Hi-C, TSA-seq, and DamID-seq. Minor intron-containing genes (MIGs) and their introns were enriched in compartment A and speckle-associated domains (SPADs) and depleted from lamina-associated domains.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02793-2?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[Cell Reports Physical Science] Bio-inspired biped microwalker with magneto-acoustic actuation for cell manipulation</title><link>https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-physical-science/fulltext/S2666-3864(25)00632-0?rss=yes</link><description>Cherukumilli et al. present a bio-inspired bipedal microwalker that can be actuated by magnetic and acoustic fields for locomotion.

However, their reported lattice thermal conductivities ( κ) remain highly inconsistent, with experimental values and theoretical predictions differing by more than an order of magnitude. These discrepancies stem from uncertainties in measurement techniques, variations in computational protocols, and ambiguities in the treatment of higher-order anharmonic processes. In this study, we critically review these inconsistencies, first by mapping the spread of experimental and modeling results, and then by identifying the methodological origins of divergence. To this end, we bridge first-principles calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and state-of-the-art machine learning force fields (MLFFs), including recently developed foundation models. We train and benchmark GAP, MACE, NEP, and HIPHIVE against density functional theory and rigorously evaluate the impact of third- and fourth-order phonon scattering processes on  κ. The computational efficiency of MLFFs enables us to extend convergence tests beyond conventional limits and to validate predictions through homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular dynamics as well. Our analysis demonstrates that, contrary to some recent claims, fully converged four-phonon processes contribute negligibly to the intrinsic thermal conductivity of both MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. These findings not only refine the intrinsic transport limits of 2D TMDs but also establish MLFF-based approaches as a robust and scalable framework for predictive modeling of phonon-mediated thermal transport in low-dimensional materials.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041424/3375425/Thermal-conductivity-limits-of-MoS2-and-MoSe2</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Widely Targeted Metabolomics and Machine Learning Identify Succinate as a Key Metabolite in Sepsis-Associated Encephalopathy</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02781-6?rss=yes</link><description>Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a common and serious complication of sepsis that leads to acute brain dysfunction and long-term cognitive impairment. We used widely targeted LC–MS/MS plasma metabolomics in 29 healthy controls, 32 sepsis patients, and 27 SAE patients, combined with machine learning, to define metabolic patterns across these groups.

The optimized Li1.3Ti(PO4)1.3/3F4 achieves a Li+ conductivity of 1.16 × 10−5 S cm−1, two orders of magnitude higher than that of analogous Li2TiF6. Combining the inherent high-voltage stability of fluoride and the excellent ionic conductivity of Li1.3Ti(PO4)1.3/3F4, this material enables superior 5 V-class all-solid-state battery performance. This work opens a new avenue for designing high-conductivity fluoride SSEs and advancing the performance of 5 V-class all-solid-state batteries.</description><author>Joule</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00414-3?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Beyond Interpolation: Integration of Data and AI-Extracted Knowledge for High-Entropy Alloy Discovery</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00400D</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, Accepted Manuscript&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00400D, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Minh Quyet Ha, Dinh-Khiet  Le, Viet-Cuong  Nguyen, Hiori  Kino, Stefano Curtarolo, Hieu-Chi Dam&lt;br /&gt;Discovering novel high-entropy alloys (HEAs) with desirable properties is challenged by the vast compositional space and the complexity of phase formation mechanisms.

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), AXIN1 mutations associate with a poor-prognosis subtype distinct from β-catenin-mutant HCC (CTNNB1). To assess how AXIN1-deficiency drives HCC, we introduced HCC-associated AXIN1 and CTNNB1 mutations in human liver cancer cells and liver-derived organoids. We show that AXIN1 mutations activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling to varying but generally lower levels than CTNNB1 mutations.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02762-2?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Association between Biological Aging and Coronary Heart Disease: A Secondary Analysis of Two Observational Studies</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02739-7?rss=yes</link><description>While aging is a well-established contributor to cardiovascular disease, the specific relation between biological aging—as assessed by PhenoAge and PhenoAge acceleration—and the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) requires further evidence to elucidate. This study conducted a cross-sectional analysis using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), alongside both cross-sectional and prospective analyses using data from the UK Biobank, to investigate the association between biological aging and CHD risk across two large cohorts.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02739-7?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[Newton] Discreteness, computation, and rules of life for self-organization dynamics beyond equilibrium</title><link>https://www.cell.com/newton/fulltext/S2950-6360(25)00350-0?rss=yes</link><description>Living systems can appear static or in thermal equilibrium yet still have the capacity to revive. In this perspective, Hyun Youk introduces non-equilibrium capacity—the ability of a system to generate, sustain, and renew life-associated dynamics even after these have halted indefinitely. By slowing or suspending cellular life, together with rule-based, generalized cellular automata, a framework is proposed that unites the physical and computational principles of self-organization and explains why life’s capacity for self-renewal can persist yet is ultimately lost.</description><author>Newton</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid

A Cognitive Decomposition of Odor-Evoked Retrieval</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02728-2?rss=yes</link><description>A single scent can unlock vivid memories. This study investigates the factors that make some odors more evocative than others. We examined odor-evoked episodic memory in 106 participants who experienced odors embedded in distinct visuospatial contexts, and whose memory was tested 24–72 hours later. The protocol empirically dissociates odor recognition (“I’ve already smelled this scent”) and associative memory (“It evokes a memory”) processes. Using machine learning with SHapley Additive exPlanations, we identified distinct predictors for each process.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02728-2?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Combining DNA Methylation Features and Clinical Characteristics Predicts Ketamine Treatment Response for PTSD</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02706-3?rss=yes</link><description>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exhibits extensive clinical and biological variability, making treatment challenging.

The cryo-state preserves metastable SEI components, such as LiPOxFy, which decompose into stable products, such as LiF, with gas release upon warming. Discussions highlight critical XPS conditions, including ultrahigh vacuum exposure, X-ray-induced damage, and neutralizer settings, which could alter the detection and characterization of SEI components.</description><author>Chem</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/chem/fulltext/S2451-9294(25)00428-0?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] One step retrosynthesis of drugs from commercially available chemical building blocks and conceivable coupling reactions</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00310E</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/image/GA?id=D5DD00310E" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, Advance Article&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00310E, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Babak Mahjour, Felix Katzenburg, Emil Lammi, Tim Cernak&lt;br /&gt;In this report, the compounds listed in DrugBank were structurally mapped to a commercial catalog of chemical feedstocks through reaction agnostic one step retrosynthetic disconnection.&lt;br /&gt;To cite this article before page numbers are assigned, use the DOI form of citation above.&lt;br /&gt;The content of this RSS Feed (c) The Royal Society of Chemistry&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00310E</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Comparative proteomic analysis of the ECM composition of the human omentum and mesentery, the main sites of ovarian cancer metastasis</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02722-1?rss=yes</link><description>Due to its limited symptoms, high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) has frequently metastasized extensively throughout the peritoneal cavity prior to its diagnosis, resulting in an overall five-year survival rate of less than 50%. The omentum and mesentery are two of the most common metastatic sites in HGSOC. However, the mechanisms underlying HGSOC metastatic tropism remain unknown.

Historically, manual inspections have been plagued by subjectivity, inefficiency, and restricted scalability, necessitating the development of enhanced detection algorithms. This research introduces a novel approach utilizing image processing and machine learning to enhance detection accuracy and practical applicability. This strategy promotes classification stability by integrating machine learning classifiers, including k-Nearest Neighbors, Artificial Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and Linear Discriminant Analysis, with fusion techniques such as Majority Voting and Mean Fusion. The experiments utilize Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation for model evaluation to address dataset variability and deliver thorough assessments. The study’s results indicate that the suggested system surpasses existing systems in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, attaining an overall accuracy of 98.17%. The method is effective across various noise and resolution parameters, allowing for scalability in precision agriculture applications. This discovery not only enhances the diagnosis of plant nutrient deficiencies but also enables further investigations into real-time plant health monitoring.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Machine Learning Current Issue</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/aml/article/3/4/046111/3374702/Smart-detection-of-plant-nutrient-deficiencies</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] PEMD: a high-throughput simulation and analysis framework for solid polymer electrolytes</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2026/DD/D5DD00454C</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/image/GA?id=D5DD00454C" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2026, Advance Article&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00454C, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY-NC.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Shendong Tan, Bochun Liang, Dexin Lu, Chaoyuan Ji, Wenke Ji, Zihui Li, Tingzheng Hou&lt;br /&gt;PEMD is an open-source Python framework that integrates polymer construction, force-field parameterization, multiscale simulation, and property analysis, with standardized workflows for screening and data-driven design of solid polymer electrolytes.&lt;br /&gt;To cite this article before page numbers are assigned, use the DOI form of citation above.&lt;br /&gt;The content of this RSS Feed (c) The Royal Society of Chemistry&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2026/DD/D5DD00454C</guid></item><item><title>[AI for Science - latest papers] Investigating CO adsorption on Cu(111) and Rh(111) surfaces using machine learning exchange-correlation functionals</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae21fa</link><description>The ‘CO adsorption puzzle’, a persistent failure of utilizing generalized gradient approximations in density functional theory to replicate CO’s experimental preference for top-site adsorption on transition-metal surfaces, remains a critical barrier in surface chemistry. While hybrid functionals such as HSE06 partially resolve this discrepancy, their prohibitive computational cost limits broader applications. We tackle this issue by adopting the Deep Kohn–Sham (DeePKS) method to train machine-learned exchange-correlation functionals. Principal component analysis reveals that the input descriptors for electronic structures separate distinctly across different chemical environments, enabling the DeePKS models to generalize to multi-element systems. We train system-specific DeePKS models for transition-metal surfaces Cu(111) and Rh(111). These models successfully recover experimental site preferences, yielding adsorption energy differences of about 10 meV compared to HSE06, and can be applied to study unseen adsorbate coverages. Furthermore, a single model for the two surfaces is trained, and the model achieves comparable accuracy in predicting not only adsorption energies and site preference but also potential energy surfaces and relaxed surface adsorption structures. The work demonstrates a promising path towards universal models, enabling catalyst exploration with hybrid functional accuracy at substantially reduced cost.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae21fa</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Consensus machine learning identifies cell death gene signature for carotid artery stenosis diagnosis</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02658-6?rss=yes</link><description>Carotid artery stenosis (CAS) is a major contributor to ischemic stroke, and molecular tools for its early detection remain limited.

Surprisingly little is known about individuals’ spatio-temporal behaviors preceding naturally occurring social integration events. We here applied a biologging-based approach to study juvenile ravens during dispersal, when they approach and join non-breeder groups. We computed three GPS-based movement metrics as proxies for their attraction to locations used by the local non-breeder flock and their attraction to other conspecifics.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02673-2?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] RNAi-based screen for pigmentation in Drosophila melanogaster reveals regulators of brain dopamine and sleep</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02649-5?rss=yes</link><description>The dopaminergic system has a large role in behavior and neurological disease and understanding dopamine level regulation in vivo is critical. To identify dopamine regulators, we utilized Drosophila melanogaster cuticle pigmentation, where dopamine is a precursor to melanin. We measured dopamine from known pigmentation mutants (e.g. tan, ebony, black) and performed an RNAi-based screen to identify additional regulators. We found 153 hits, enriched for developmental signaling pathways and mitochondria-associated proteins.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02649-5?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Yet the link between sensorimotor recalibration to new physical conditions and cognitive updating of internal models remains unclear. We addressed this using altered gravity as a model system. In a within-subject study, 25 adults completed a virtual-reality task requiring motor adjustment to non-terrestrial gravities and an online problem-solving task requiring physical reasoning under matched gravity manipulations. Adaptability in each domain was computed relative to performance under terrestrial gravity.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02604-5?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

To better understand the molecular regulators of NC function, we profiled the proteome of human fetal NP cells and identified Ellis-van Creveld (EVC) protein as highly enriched in NCs. Using mouse models and CRISPR-engineered human NP cells, we show that EVC facilitates Shh signaling, supports NP cell phenotype, and limits fibrotic matrix changes.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02551-9?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Small: Table of Contents] Label‐Free Detection of Nuclear Envelope Nucleoporation using 2D Morphological Embeddings and Machine Learning</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smll.202504402?af=R</link><description>Small, Volume 21, Issue 48, December 3, 2025.</description><author>Wiley: Small: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 15:24:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/smll.202504402</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Functional Materials: Table of Contents] Machine Learning‐Enabled Polymer Discovery for Enhanced Pulmonary siRNA Delivery</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adfm.202502805?af=R</link><description>Advanced Functional Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 2, 2025.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Functional Materials: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 08:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/adfm.202502805</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Functional Materials: Table of Contents] Enhanced Potassium Ion Diffusion and Interface Stability Enabled by Potassiophilic rGO/CNTs/NaF Micro‐Lattice Aerogel for High‐Performance Potassium Metal Batteries</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adfm.202508586?af=R</link><description>Advanced Functional Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 2, 2025.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Functional Materials: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 08:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/adfm.202508586</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Reviews Physics] Predicting high-entropy alloy phases with machine learning</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-025-00903-8</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Reviews Physics, Published online: 03 December 2025; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-025-00903-8"&gt;doi:10.1038/s42254-025-00903-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Omokhuwele Umoru explains how generative adversarial networks can help to predict the phases of high-entropy alloys.</description><author>Nature Reviews Physics</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-025-00903-8</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] AI enhancing differential diagnosis of acute chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and acute heart failure</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02458-7?rss=yes</link><description>Cardiovascular medicine; Respiratory medicine; Machine learning</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02458-7?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] United multi-omics and machine learning refine regulatory T cell-defined hepatocellular carcinoma subtypes</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02589-1?rss=yes</link><description>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is highly heterogeneous and aggressive, and the absence of precision individual treatment regimen enables repeated immune escape. Exploiting Treg-marker genes as key classifiers, we used 10 clustering algorithms to integrate the multi-omics HCC patients data and combined with 10 machine learning (ML) algorithms to delineate molecular subtypes to define molecular subtypes predictive of prognosis and immune response.

Conventional analysis techniques often rely on restrictive assumptions or manual interventions, limiting their applicability to complex, noisy datasets. Here, we introduce &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;RTNinja&lt;/span&gt;, a generalized, fully automated machine learning framework for the unsupervised analysis of random telegraph noise signals. &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;RTNinja&lt;/span&gt; deconvolves complex signals to identify the number and characteristics of hidden individual sources without requiring prior knowledge of the system. The framework comprises two modular components: &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;LevelsExtractor&lt;/span&gt;, which uses Bayesian inference and model selection to denoise and discretize the signal, and &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;SourcesMapper&lt;/span&gt;, which infers source configurations through probabilistic clustering and optimization. To evaluate performance, we developed a Monte Carlo simulator that generates labeled datasets spanning broad signal-to-noise ratios and source complexities; across 7000 such datasets, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;RTNinja&lt;/span&gt; consistently demonstrated high-fidelity signal reconstruction and accurate extraction of source amplitudes and activity patterns. Our results demonstrate that &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;RTNinja&lt;/span&gt; offers a robust, scalable, and device-agnostic tool for random telegraph noise characterization, enabling large-scale statistical benchmarking, reliability-centric technology qualification, predictive failure modeling, and device physics exploration in next-generation nanoelectronics.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Machine Learning Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/aml/article/3/4/046109/3373556/RTNinja-A-generalized-machine-learning-framework</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] A pilot study: Incorporating Treponema pallidum antigens into machine learning models for accurate syphilis treatment outcome assessment</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02536-2?rss=yes</link><description>Health informatics; disease; artificial intelligence applications</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02536-2?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

We present the deterministic characterization with an integrated parallelizable hybrid resolver architecture, a hybrid machine learning framework designed for fast, accurate analysis of XFEL diagnostics using angular streaking-based sinogram images. This architecture integrates convolutional neural networks and bidirectional long short-term memory models to denoise input, identify x-ray sub-spike features, and extract sub-spike relative delays with sub-30 attosecond temporal resolution. Deployed on low-latency hardware, it achieves over 10 kHz throughput with 168.3 &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;μ&lt;/span&gt;s inference latency, indicating scalability to 14 kHz with field-programmable gate array integration. By transforming regression tasks into classification problems and leveraging optimized error encoding, we achieve high precision with low-latency performance that is critical for real-time streaming event selection and experimental control feedback signals. This represents a key development in real-time control pipelines for next-generation autonomous science, generally, and high repetition-rate x-ray experiments in particular.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Machine Learning Current Issue</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/aml/article/3/4/046107/3373060/A-hybrid-neural-architecture-Online-attosecond-x</guid></item><item><title>[Joule] Accelerated discovery of CO2-to-C3-hydrocarbon electrocatalysts with human-in-the-loop</title><link>https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00394-0?rss=yes</link><description>Despite advances in automation and AI, accelerating discovery in heterogeneous electrocatalysts remains hindered by the experimental challenges of building integrated platforms for synthesis and evaluation, as well as limited performance-relevant data.

We create a database of all two-generated subgroups of the symmetric group on n-objects and conduct a classification of finite simple groups among them using shallow feed-forward neural networks. We show that this neural network classifier can decipher the property of simplicity with varying accuracies depending on the features. Our neural network model leads to a natural conjecture concerning the generators of a finite simple group. We subsequently prove this conjecture. This new toy theorem comments on the necessary properties of generators of finite simple groups. We show this explicitly for a class of sporadic groups for which the result holds. Our work further makes the case for a machine motivated study of algebraic structures in pure mathematics and highlights the possibility of generating new conjectures and theorems in mathematics with the aid of machine learning.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae1d98</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents] Taguchi–Bayesian Sampling: A Roadmap for Polymer Database Construction Toward Small Representative Machine Learning</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aidi.202500150?af=R</link><description>Advanced Intelligent Discovery, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 05:00:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/aidi.202500150</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] An explainable machine learning model predicts 30-day readmission after vertebral augmentation</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02400-9?rss=yes</link><description>Orthopedics; Machine learning</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02400-9?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

This review explores the synergistic integration of metasurfaces—engineered sub-wavelength planar structures—and quantum optics, which exploits quantum mechanical principles to manipulate light at the most granular level. We outline the design principles, fabrication processes, and computational challenges involved in creating quantum metasurfaces, discussing both forward and inverse design approaches. Advances in nanofabrication and intelligent optimization techniques, such as machine learning and topology optimization, have enabled the development of metasurfaces with unparalleled control over electromagnetic waves. We examine recent progress in using quantum metasurfaces for single-photon and multi-photon generation, quantum imaging, and quantum sensing, showcasing how these innovations achieve unprecedented precision and novel functionalities. Additionally, we highlight the integration of metasurfaces into quantum light manipulation, emphasizing their role in enhancing wavefront shaping and entanglement control. By providing a comprehensive survey of current advancements and future research directions, this review highlights the vast potential of metasurfaces and quantum optics at the crossroads, setting the stage for next-generation technological innovations that will define the forthcoming decade.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041318/3372590/Synergistic-integration-of-metasurfaces-and</guid></item><item><title>[AI for Science - latest papers] Universal machine learning potentials for systems with reduced dimensionality</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae1208</link><description>We present a benchmark designed to evaluate the predictive capabilities of universal machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) across systems of varying dimensionality. Specifically, our benchmark tests zero- (molecules, atomic clusters, etc), one- (nanowires, nanoribbons, nanotubes, etc), two- (atomic layers and slabs) and three-dimensional (3D) (bulk materials) compounds. The benchmark reveals that while all tested models demonstrate excellent performance for 3D systems, accuracy degrades progressively for lower-dimensional structures. The best performing models for geometry optimization are orbital version 2, equiformerV2, and the equivariant Smooth Energy Network, with the equivariant Smooth Energy Network also providing the most accurate energies. Our results indicate that the best models yield, on average, errors in the atomic positions in the range of 0.01–0.02 Å and errors in the energy below 10 meV atom−1 across all dimensionalities. These results demonstrate that state-of-the-art universal MLIPs have reached sufficient accuracy to serve as direct replacements for density functional theory calculations, at a small fraction of the computational cost, in simulations spanning the full range from isolated atoms to bulk solids. More significantly, the best performing models already enable efficient simulations of complex systems containing subsystems of mixed dimensionality, opening new possibilities for modeling realistic materials and interfaces.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae1208</guid></item><item><title>[Cell Reports Physical Science] Conjugated polyelectrolyte-aptamer hybrid for organic-electrochemical-transistor-based sensing</title><link>https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-physical-science/fulltext/S2666-3864(25)00564-8?rss=yes</link><description>Jiang et al. present biofunctionalized organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors (OMIECs), specifically single-component materials that integrate high specificity with semiconducting properties, exemplified by p(NDI-T-ZI/EG)-aptamer.

By rewriting core atomistic simulation primitives in PyTorch, TorchSim can achieve orders of magnitude acceleration for popular MLIPs. Unlike existing molecular dynamics (MD) packages, which simulate one system at a time, TorchSim performs batched simulations that efficiently utilize modern GPUs by evolving multiple systems concurrently. TorchSim supports MD integrators, structural relaxation optimizers, both machine-learned and classical interatomic potentials (such as Lennard–Jones, Morse, soft-sphere), batching with automatic memory management, differentiable simulation, and integration with popular materials informatics tools.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae1799</guid></item><item><title>[AI for Science - latest papers] Graph learning metallic glass discovery from Wikipedia</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae1b20</link><description>Synthesizing new materials efficiently is highly demanded in various research fields. However, this process is usually slow and expensive, especially for metallic glasses, whose formation strongly depends on the optimal combinations of multiple elements to resist crystallization. This constraint renders only several thousands of candidates explored in the vast material space since 1960. Recently, data-driven approaches armed by advanced machine learning techniques provided alternative routes for intelligent materials design. Due to data scarcity and immature material encoding, the conventional tabular data is usually mined by statistical learning algorithms, giving limited model predictability and generalizability. Here, we propose sophisticated data learning from material network representations. The node elements are encoded from the Wikipedia by a language model. Graph neural networks with versatile architectures are designed to serve as recommendation systems to explore hidden relationships among materials. By employing Wikipedia embeddings from different languages, we assess the capability of natural languages in materials design. Our study proposes a new paradigm to harvesting new amorphous materials and beyond with artificial intelligence.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae1b20</guid></item><item><title>[ACS Materials Au: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Molecular Modeling-Based Machine Learning for Accurate Prediction of Gas Diffusivity and Permeability in Metal–Organic Frameworks</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsmaterialsau.5c00111</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acsmaterialsau.5c00111/asset/images/medium/mg5c00111_0007.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Materials Au&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialsau.5c00111&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>ACS Materials Au: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 18:15:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsmaterialsau.5c00111</guid></item><item><title>[Recent Articles in PRX Energy] Dynamic Vacancy Levels in ${\mathrm{Cs}\mathrm{Pb}\mathrm{Cl}}_{3}$ Obey Equilibrium Defect Thermodynamics</title><link>http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/dxmb-8s96</link><description>Author(s): Irea Mosquera-Lois and Aron Walsh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study of halide perovskites uses advanced molecular dynamics simulations with machine learning force fields to identify dynamic defect levels and their impact on the material’s optoelectronic properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height="" src="https://cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/PRXENERGY/key_images/10.1103/dxmb-8s96.png" width="200" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[PRX Energy 4, 043008] Published Wed Nov 12, 2025</description><author>Recent Articles in PRX Energy</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/dxmb-8s96</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Compared to previous neural network-based methods, this work employs a lightweight network for frequency recognition and then dynamically configures the structure of a subsequent CNN based on the recognition result. By adapting the calibration scheme to the input signal characteristics, the proposed method achieves high accuracy, reduces overfitting at low frequencies, and saves hardware cost. A 12-bit 3.6-GS/s TI-ADC test board with programmable timing skew is used to validate the method. Measurement results show that at Nyquist input, SNDR and SFDR are improved from 34.23 and 35.77 dB to 51.85 and 62.67 dB after calibration, respectively. Implemented on FPGA, the power consumption of the calibrator is 40 mW, where the frequency recognition network contributes 12.5%. The proposed method is applicable to various types of input signals, including single-tone, multi-tone, and modulated signals.</description><author>IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs - new TOC</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 13:17:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11236426</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Despite their remarkable success in predicting bulk properties, no systematic evaluation has assessed how well these universal MLIPs (uMLIPs) can predict cleavage energies, a critical property governing fracture, catalysis, surface stability, and interfacial phenomena. Here, we present a comprehensive benchmark of 19 state-of-the-art uMLIPs for cleavage energy prediction using our previously established density functional theory database of 36 718 slab structures spanning elemental, binary, and ternary metallic compounds. We evaluate diverse architectural paradigms, analyzing their performance across chemical compositions, crystal systems, thickness, and surface orientations. Our zero-shot evaluation results reveal that training data composition dominates architectural sophistication: models trained on the Open Materials 2024 (OMat24) dataset, which emphasizes non-equilibrium configurations, achieve mean absolute percentage errors below 6% and correctly identify the thermodynamically most stable surface terminations in 87% of cases, without any explicit surface energy training. In contrast, architecturally identical models trained on equilibrium-only datasets show five-fold higher errors, while models trained on surface-adsorbate data fail catastrophically with a 17-fold degradation. Remarkably, simpler architectures trained on appropriate data achieve comparable accuracy to complex transformers while offering 10–100× computational speedup. These findings fundamentally reframe MLIP development priorities: highlighting that strategic training-data generation with appropriate non-equilibrium sampling deserves equal or greater attention than architectural complexity.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae1408</guid></item><item><title>[Joule] Li–Si compound anodes enabling high-performance all-solid-state Li-ion batteries</title><link>https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00376-9?rss=yes</link><description>Li–Si compound anodes, exemplified by Li2.33Si, overcome the degradation issues of conventional Si anodes by combining high ionic and electronic conductivity, favorable mechanical properties, and a negligible-volume-change Li-storage mechanism (Li2.33 + αSi, 0 &lt; α &lt; 0.92), thereby enabling high areal capacity, long cycle life, and fast rate capability in all-solid-state Li-ion batteries.</description><author>Joule</author><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00376-9?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

To preserve garment comfort and flexibility, kNOT eliminates bulky boards and interposers through direct-die attachment to embroidered yarns. The SoC features reconfigurable IO pads, global fault-tolerant bootup, and high-precision clock synchronization, while the bySPI chiplet implements a compact, COTS-compatible three-wire SPI protocol supporting group access, soft-reset, and direction-controlled routing. Together, they support distributed programming, synchronized timestamping, and efficient inter-chiplet communication. The chiplets, fabricated in 65-nm CMOS, demonstrate robust operation across a textile network interfacing with commercial sensors and memories. Operating at 1.8 V with on-chip 1.12-V regulation, the SoC consumes power of 1.98 mW at 50 MHz, and bySPI consumes 0.22 mW at 25 MHz. This high integrability and functionality position kNOT as a promising foundation for scalable, garment-spanning wearable intelligence.</description><author>IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits - new TOC</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 13:16:12 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11224869</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue] Dynamic landscape of chemiresistive breathomic nanosensors based on fifth-generation chips for complex disease diagnosis and healthcare monitoring</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041311/3371043/Dynamic-landscape-of-chemiresistive-breathomic</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;The growing global population is overwhelming the existing medical infrastructure, demanding a pressing need for the advancement of early-stage and point-of-care disease diagnostics. Conventional techniques are mostly invasive, time-consuming, expensive, sophisticated, and centered at urban facilities. Moreover, they are unable to address the biological complexities related to critical diseases, disorders, and pandemics, resulting in associated high morbidity and mortality. To address this gap, miniaturized fifth-generation sensing chips provide alternatives in terms of accessibility, affordability, and adaptability, being point-of-care and minimally invasive diagnostics. In this context, Breathomic chips based on nanoscale semiconductors have shown their potential for noninvasive, personalized, and on-site operation, offering the capability to identify volatile organic compounds/gases as disease biomarkers from exhaled breath and enabling early disease detection. However, the practical implementation of these sensors in real-time medical contexts remains challenging due to factors including the lack of clinical trials, dedicated data analysis, understanding of the complexities, public awareness, scalability, and accessibility. This comprehensive review critically summarizes the landscape of breath biomarkers detecting fifth-generation chemiresistive chips for human disease diagnosis, methodically outlining associated challenges, alternative strategies, and prospects for clinical implementations and commercial advancement. It details the biological origins of biomarkers, the diverse sensing modalities, and the underlying mechanisms pertaining to breathomic biomarker diagnosis. Furthermore, it highlights the integration of digital-age technologies, including nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, bioinformatics, and machine learning, for high-performance breathomic chips. These next-generation smart sensory chips have the potential to revolutionize medical healthcare facilities, improving patient outcomes, understanding prognosis, and aiding the UN's sustainable development goals.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041311/3371043/Dynamic-landscape-of-chemiresistive-breathomic</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

We demonstrate the solution to Max 3-Cut can be formulated in terms of minimizing the Potts Hamiltonian. We propose to minimize the Potts Hamiltonian using a network of connected oscillators under divide-by-3 injection locking. We derive the steady state solution of the oscillator network by applying impulse sensitivity function (ISF) theory. We design a CMOS tripolar oscillator network circuit for computing the Max 3-Cut of a triforce graph (first-order Sierpiński triangle graph). We develop a second circuit to perform image segmentation, using signed (positive/negative) couplings. We then extend our circuit to simulate the dynamics of social network alliances, using a combination of signed and weighted couplings that play an essential role in computing Max 3-Cut. Spectre simulation results are in good agreement with the theoretical analysis.</description><author>IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs - new TOC</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 13:20:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11222766</guid></item><item><title>[tandf: Materials Research Letters: Table of Contents] Machine learning-assisted design of strong and ductile BCC high-entropy alloys</title><link>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21663831.2025.2577751?af=R</link><description>Volume 13, Issue 12, December 2025, Page 1260-1268&lt;br /&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;</description><author>tandf: Materials Research Letters: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 12:22:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">/doi/full/10.1080/21663831.2025.2577751?af=R</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Although deep learning-based dehazing algorithms can significantly enhance image quality, their high computational complexity and storage demands make them challenging to deploy on resource-constrained hardware platforms. To address this, we propose an efficient dehazing neural network featuring physical perception model and cross-scale pixel attention (EP-CSANet), together with its hardware accelerator. In terms of algorithm, we design an efficient physical perception model (EPM) based on the atmospheric scattering model (ASM), combined with adaptive channel attention (ACA), which accurately approximates atmospheric light (A) and transmittance [t(x)], and effectively adapts to various environmental conditions, significantly improving dehazing accuracy. Furthermore, to enhance multiscale information interaction and preserve fine-grained texture details, we introduce cross-scale pixel attention (CSPA), which utilizes a dual-branch approach to extract high receptive-field information while maintaining fine-grained textures. In terms of hardware, we design a dedicated FPGA-based dehazing acceleration architecture. Through an efficient 16-stage pipeline, we achieve a dehazing rate of 127 frames per second (fps) for  $640\times 480$  images, meeting real-time processing requirements. In addition, by incorporating sparse convolution optimization techniques, we significantly improve resource utilization: LUTs increased by 31.8%, FFs by 27.9%, and DSPs by 22.3%. Experimental results demonstrate that EP-CSANet, using only 2361 parameters on the SOTS dataset, outperforms other dehazing algorithms.

However, their practical deployment is hindered by persistent challenges—dendritic growth, unstable solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs), and severe volumetric expansion. Emerging as a transformative solution, three-dimensional (3D) printing enables the rational design of multiscale architectures (e.g., micro-lattice anodes and gradient-porous cathodes) and hybrid solid-state electrolytes to address these limitations. This review presents a pioneering synthesis of 3D printing's role in lithium-metal battery engineering, focusing on its capacity to regulate lithium-ion flux, stabilize SEIs, and suppress dendrite proliferation through hierarchical structural control. We systematically analyze four key additive manufacturing technologies (inkjet printing, direct ink writing, fused deposition modeling, and stereolithography), delineating their unique advantages in tailoring ion transport pathways and mechanical robustness. Furthermore, we propose multi-material co-printing strategies to resolve interfacial incompatibilities in monolithic lithium-metal batteries, a critical barrier in current research. By bridging additive manufacturing with electrochemical fundamentals, this work outlines a roadmap to harness 3D printing's full potential, addressing scalability challenges and advancing applications in aerospace, wearables, and biomedical devices where energy density and safety are paramount.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041310/3369005/3D-printed-lithium-metal-batteries-Multiscale</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents] Harnessing Large Language Models to Advance Microbiome Research: From Sequence Analysis to Clinical Applications</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aidi.202500038?af=R</link><description>Advanced Intelligent Discovery, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 05:48:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/aidi.202500038</guid></item><item><title>[Newton] Mapping the three-dimensional structure of faceted gold mesocrystals using coherent X-ray diffraction imaging</title><link>https://www.cell.com/newton/fulltext/S2950-6360(25)00261-0?rss=yes</link><description>Understanding the structure-property relationship of self-assembled superstructures requires non-destructive 3D structural analysis, which can then facilitate the development of mesocrystals with collective and emergent properties.

It employs a vector-scalar dual-core architecture with 2 levels of pipelines and the spike/error-event-driven paradigm to ensure a high sample throughput. A logically transposable memory enables the vector core’s flexible parallelism along the neuron- or the synapse-dimension in different processing phases. We prototyped our design on a very-low-cost Xilinx Zynq-7010 FPGA chip, and demonstrated its overall performance superiority over other related works, in terms of on-chip learning accuracy, processing speed, resource cost and energy efficiency.</description><author>IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs - new TOC</author><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 13:19:14 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11208669</guid></item><item><title>[AI for Science - latest papers] AInstein: numerical Einstein metrics via machine learning</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae1117</link><description>A new semi-supervised machine learning package is introduced which successfully solves the Euclidean vacuum Einstein equations with a cosmological constant, without any symmetry assumptions. The model architecture contains subnetworks for each patch in the manifold-defining atlas. Each subnetwork predicts the components of a metric in its associated patch, with the relevant Einstein conditions of the form being used as independent loss components (here , where n is the dimension of the Riemannian manifold, and the Einstein constant ). To ensure the consistency of the global structure of the manifold, another loss component is introduced across the patch subnetworks which enforces the coordinate transformation between the patches, , for an appropriate analytically known Jacobian J. We test our method for the case of spheres represented by a pair of patches in dimensions 2, 3, 4, and 5. In dimensions 2 and 3, the geometries have been fully classified. However, it is unknown whether a Ricci-flat metric can exist on spheres in dimensions 4 and 5. This work hints against the existence of such a metric.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae1117</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Biocatalytic Stereodivergent Construction of Axially Chiral Tri- and Tetrasubstituted Allenols via Desymmetric Hydroxylation</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c08146</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c08146/asset/images/medium/ja5c08146_0005.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c08146&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 16:48:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c08146</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] A Highly Selective Cobalt Catalyst for Primary Amine Synthesis from Carboxylic Acids, Esters, and Vegetable Oils</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c10097</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c10097/asset/images/medium/ja5c10097_0009.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c10097&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 19:50:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c10097</guid></item><item><title>[IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs - new TOC] A 29-Gb/s D-Band Gain-Boosted OOK Modulator With 60-dB On-Off Ratio in 28-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11204375</link><description>This brief presents a D-band on-off keying (OOK) modulator fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS process.

While PCC is essential for reducing bandwidth and storage demands, existing octree-based learned PCC methods face two fundamental bottlenecks: 1) octree construction and serialization that involve irregular, pointwise memory accesses that are difficult to parallelize and 2) autoregressive entropy model inference that requires heavy computation. These issues lead to high latency and energy consumption, making real-time deployment on edge devices impractical. This article introduces COPIC, a hardware accelerator designed for real-time PCC on edge devices. COPIC integrates two key components. The first is OctCAM, a content-addressable-memory (CAM)-based module for rapid octree construction and serialization. By enabling hardware-level parallel search, OctCAM significantly reduces the latency and energy consumption caused by irregular memory access patterns in octree processing. The second is PCC-Engine, a dedicated neural network inference module. Combined with a lightweight PCC-TinyAttention network and a window-based key-value caching approach, it further minimizes execution latency and power usage. Experimental results show that COPIC achieves a  $25.9\times $  speedup compared to GPU implementations, with a total processing latency of 40.1 ms and an average energy consumption of 0.23 J per frame, while delivering a compression rate 12.4% higher than standard proposals.</description><author>IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems - new TOC</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 13:16:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11201934</guid></item><item><title>[Matter] Dynamic pressure mapping of infant cervical spines using a wearable magnetoelastic patch</title><link>https://www.cell.com/matter/fulltext/S2590-2385(25)00529-6?rss=yes</link><description>To enable continuous monitoring of infant cervical motion, we present a kirigami-inspired soft magnetoelastic patch that conforms intimately to the cervical position without compromising comfort.

In practical application scenarios, the sparsity of the signal is often unknown, which requires reconstruction algorithms to operate under sparsity-adaptive conditions. Existing sparsity adaptive algorithms have various limitations, and no algorithm has demonstrated good reconstruction performance in noisy real-world environments. This article fully considers reconstruction accuracy, robustness, and hardware complexity and proposes a sparsity adaptive atomic correlation difference pursuit (SA-ACDP) algorithm to achieve a balance among reconstruction accuracy, robustness, and hardware complexity. Experimental results show that the SA-ACDP algorithm achieves better reconstruction success rate (SR) compared with the existing sparsity adaptive algorithms and comparable reconstruction SR to existing algorithms with prior sparsity knowledge. It also exhibits better robustness and lower hardware complexity compared to existing algorithms. A hardware architecture applying the SA-ACDP algorithm is designed and implemented on a Virtex UltraScale+ FPGA with matrix dimension  $= 1024\times 256$ , maximum sparsity  $K_{\max }= 128$ . The proposed architecture achieves a reconstruction signal-to-noise ratio (RSNR) of 35.11 dB for random signals and 28.3 dB for ECG signals, with 18-bits data width and 13-bits fractional width. The maximum clock frequency of the architecture is 200 MHz, enabling reconstruction within  $231~\mu $ s. The proposed architecture achieves a dynamic power consumption of 2393 mW.</description><author>IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems - new TOC</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 13:16:53 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11197133</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue] The enduring legacy of scanning spreading resistance microscopy: Overview, advancements, and future directions</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041305/3366934/The-enduring-legacy-of-scanning-spreading</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Scanning spreading resistance microscopy (SSRM) has recently celebrated 30 years of existence when counting from the original patent of 1994. In this time, the technique has experienced an incredible journey with substantial evolutions that transformed SSRM from a small-scale experiment into a staple for chip manufacturing laboratories for physical analysis of materials, failure analysis, and process development of integrated circuits. As the nanoelectronics industry is ready for a new inflection point, with the introduction of nanosheet field-effect transistor to replace FinFETs and cell track scaling architectures such as the complementary field-effect transistors, SSRM is once again at a turning point. This review aims to highlight the state-of-the-art while discussing the emerging challenges introduced by the ever-increasing complexity in complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) manufacturing. We start by illustrating the unique capability of the SSRM technique, its origin, and its evolution. Next, we continue by showing the considerable research effort that enabled SSRM to transition to a tomographic sensing method in support of FinFET transistors. Here, the high aspect ratio fin geometry and the complex contacts technology have imposed important modifications to the original method. Later, we elaborate on some of the key challenges introduced by the upcoming device transition from three-sided channel FinFETs into nanosheet FETs, i.e., offering a four-sided electrostatic control of the channel. Finally, we present the use of machine learning for automation in carrier calibration with increased accuracy. We close by introducing some of the concepts that we consider promising for further extension of SSRM to obtain sub-nm structural information and doping profiles in the area of advanced FinFETs and nanosheet FET technologies, including (a) correlative analysis flow, (b) liquid-assisted probing, and (c) top–down and bottom–up multi-probe sensing schemes to merge low- and high-pressure SSRM scans.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041305/3366934/The-enduring-legacy-of-scanning-spreading</guid></item><item><title>[IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs - new TOC] A Self-Organizing Linked Storage Architecture With Dynamic Partition Achieving High Capacity Utilization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11195812</link><description>This brief proposes a self-organizing linked on-chip (SLO) storage architecture and a coarse-grained management scheme for CNN accelerators.

Owing to its short modeling time, computational simplicity, and high rendering quality, it is expected to replace traditional 3-D graphics on edge devices. However, its substantial memory access requirements and the challenges of real-time modification present major barriers to deployment on mobile augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR) platforms. We present a spatial computing system-on-chip (SoC), IRIS, to enable real-time, spatially interactive rendering with surface-aware modelling (SAM). The architecture of IRIS introduces three key hardware features. First, the surface perception unit (SPU) reduces external memory access (EMA) and minimizes Gaussian sorting latency by clustering Gaussians based on surface alignment. Second, the reconfigurable ApproxLP (ALP)-based multiply-accumulator array (RAMA) achieves high computational efficiency and throughput during neural Gaussian feature generation and mesh deformation. Finally, the error direction cache (EDC) enables fast and efficient modeling by eliminating redundant backpropagation (BP) operations. As a result, IRIS is fabricated using a 28-nm process and occupies a die area of 20.25 mm2. When evaluated on the SyntheticNeRF dataset, IRIS achieves  $34.3{\times }$  faster interactive rendering and consumes  $300.0{\times }$  less energy per frame compared to an edge GPU, despite having  $21.3{\times }$  lower external memory bandwidth.</description><author>IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits - new TOC</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 13:16:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11194701</guid></item><item><title>[IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems - new TOC] FPGA Implementation of PoolFormer Network Using Python-Driven High-Level Synthesis Framework for Edge-AIoT Speech Recognition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11193813</link><description>This brief presents an edge-AIoT speech recognition system, which is based on a new spiking feature extraction (SFE) method and a PoolFormer (PF) neural network optimized for implementation on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) hardware.

However, the highly anticipated neuromorphic transformer still faces significant challenges in energy efficiency due to its heavy computational workload (primarily stemming from the self-attention mechanism), making edge deployment difficult. To address this problem, this work proposes a neuron inhibition mechanism that identifies and bypasses the computation of inactive neurons (i.e., those with extremely negative membrane potentials (MPs) and do not fire spikes). It introduces additional neuron sparsity into neuromorphic computing, significantly reducing the computational workload during inference. The mechanism is implemented using a configurable negative MP threshold. If a neuron’s MP falls below this threshold, a mask is generated to bypass the neuron in subsequent calculations. This technology facilitates the development of a sparse2 synaptic processing unit (S2-SPE), which performs computations only on synapses associated with valid spike inputs in active (non-inhibited) neurons, thereby efficiently leveraging both neuron and spike sparsity. Eventually, a neuromorphic attention core is developed based on the S2-SPE, and its effectiveness is validated on various datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the core can bypass over 98% of invalid calculations in the neuromorphic attention mechanism, achieving an outstanding energy efficiency of sub-0.06 pJ/SOP, which represents over 50% improvement compared to the baseline and outperforms related state-of-the-art (SOTA) works. This work is expected to advance neuromorphic hardware toward greater energy efficiency and facilitate its deployment in edge applications.</description><author>IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems - new TOC</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 13:16:59 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11192552</guid></item><item><title>[Chinese Chemical Society: CCS Chemistry: Table of Contents] Oxygen Vacancy-Modulated Molybdenum Oxide/Montmorillonite Heterointerface Nanoarchitectures for Plasmon-Enhanced Solar-Osmotic Energy Harvesting</title><link>https://ccs-stag.literatumonline.com/doi/abs/10.31635/ccschem.025.202506132?af=R</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.chinesechemsoc.org/cms/asset/762823f9-fd0a-4aff-acde-289220f569a8/keyimage.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;CCS Chemistry, Ahead of Print.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI:10.31635/ccschem.025.202506132&lt;/div&gt;Two-dimensional (2D) nanofluidic membranes with precise ion transport kinetics hold transformative potential for next-generation ion-selective membranes, yet their practical implementation in osmotic energy conversion remains constrained by inherent ...</description><author>Chinese Chemical Society: CCS Chemistry: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 03:22:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://ccs-stag.literatumonline.com/doi/abs/10.31635/ccschem.025.202506132?af=R</guid></item><item><title>[Chinese Chemical Society: CCS Chemistry: Table of Contents] Oxygen Vacancy-Modulated Molybdenum Oxide/Montmorillonite Heterointerface Nanoarchitectures for Plasmon-Enhanced Solar-Osmotic Energy Harvesting</title><link>https://ccs-stag.literatumonline.com.localhost.literatumonline.com:25116/doi/abs/10.31635/ccschem.025.202506132?af=R</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.chinesechemsoc.org/cms/asset/762823f9-fd0a-4aff-acde-289220f569a8/keyimage.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;CCS Chemistry, Ahead of Print.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI:10.31635/ccschem.025.202506132&lt;/div&gt;Two-dimensional (2D) nanofluidic membranes with precise ion transport kinetics hold transformative potential for next-generation ion-selective membranes, yet their practical implementation in osmotic energy conversion remains constrained by inherent ...</description><author>Chinese Chemical Society: CCS Chemistry: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 03:22:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://ccs-stag.literatumonline.com.localhost.literatumonline.com:25116/doi/abs/10.31635/ccschem.025.202506132?af=R</guid></item><item><title>[IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems - new TOC] A 9T SRAM Computation-in-Memory Architecture With High-Precision MAC, Enhanced Bitline Voltage Margin, and Improved Frequency Performance Over Conventional Architectures</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11192607</link><description>To address the data-intensive demands of modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems, computation-in-memory (CIM) based on static random-access memory (SRAM) has emerged as a promising solution by integrating computing functionality within memory arrays. However, conventional SRAM CIM architectures face two key limitations: low output resistance in single-transistor transmission paths and voltage instability on charge-sharing bitlines. These limitations collectively degrade computational accuracy to 4–5 LSB-level integral nonlinearity (INL), restricting practical deployment. This work proposes a regulated-cascode 9T SRAM cell that enhances analog computation accuracy using a high-impedance transmission path through a cascode configuration and stabilizing the discharge amount of the bitline from a single cell via active feedback regulation. Implemented in Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) 55-nm CMOS technology, the proposed cell demonstrates 1.31 LSB INL at 400-mV bitline swing (68.4% improvement versus 4–5 LSB baselines), achieving 66.7% voltage utilization efficiency compared with the conventional 50% limit and 23.04% frequency improvement is achieved compared with the conventional architecture.

Modeling this process is central to understanding cardiac sarcomere mechanics. In this study, we developed supervised machine learning (ML) models using artificial neural networks (ANNs) to simulate cross-bridge cycling and muscle behavior under isosarcometric, isometric, and isotonic conditions. Trained on synthetic data, the ANN captured nonlinear dependencies among calcium concentration, stiffness, sarcomere length, temperature, and force output. Error analysis through histograms and unity-line scatterplots validated prediction accuracy and identified underfitting and overfitting patterns.

For a benchmark set of twelve electrode and electrolyte materials, including LiCoO2, LiFePO4, and Li10GeP2S12, our MLFF‐derived barriers lie within tens of meV of density functional theory (DFT) and experiment values, while achieving a ∼100-fold speedup over standard DFT‐NEB calculations.

However, supporting such tasks on edge devices remains challenging due to the limited computational resources, memory constraints, power budgets, and high data transition latency. To address these challenges, this work proposes an ultralow-power smart vision System-on-Chip (SoC) with the following features: 1) a bitline segmented, parallel-charging read-only memory (ROM) compute-in-memory (CIM) macro with power gating and coupled coding; 2) heterogeneous similarity-aware hybrid SRAM/ROM cores to exploit temporal similarity with high core utilization; 3) an intracore and intercore pipeline with hierarchical dataflow for low-power data transmission; 4) a tilewise mixed-precision weight quantization and mapping scheme for weight data compression; and 5) a hierarchical multimodal system trigger mechanism utilizing an on-chip CMOS imager with near sensor caching to skip unnecessary inferences. The proposed ROM CIM macro achieves an area efficiency of 0.753–1.673 TOPS/mm2 and a storage density of 4706 Kb/mm2, achieving a  $3.2\!\!-\!\!14.83\times $  improvement in density Figure of Merit (FoM) over the state-of-the-art (SoTA) ROM CIM designs. The proposed SoC also shows an ultralow always-on power of  $0.13~\mu $ W and an average active power of 9.52 mW, which demonstrates a high energy efficiency of 13.6–18.3 TOPS/W (ResNet-20 with fixed-point 8-bit activation and 10-bit weight) on video understanding tasks, showing a  $1.8-3.0\times $  improvement over the existing smart vision SoCs.</description><author>IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems - new TOC</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 13:17:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11168280</guid></item><item><title>[IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits - new TOC] A 108 Gb/s PAM-4 VCSEL-Based Direct-Drive Optical Engine for Co-Packaged Optics Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11165151</link><description>This article presents a multimode vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL)-based direct-drive optical engine for co-packaged optics (CPOs) applications that employs pulse amplitude modulation (PAM)-4 to enhance shoreline bandwidth (BW) density and features a compact direct optical wiring (DOW) approach for on-package fiber termination. On the transmit side, a VCSEL driver (VCDRV) comprising a passive complementary-drive complex-zero continuous-time linear equalizer (CZ-CTLE) is introduced to compensate for the VCSEL’s complex-pole response while offering the high linearity required for PAM-4 signaling. The receiver integrates a high-linearity transimpedance amplifier front-end (TIA-FE) capable of handling large input current swings, followed by an active CZ-CTLE to equalize the complex-pole pair response of the low-gain shunt-feedback transimpedance amplifier (TIA). The transceiver prototype, fabricated in a 22-nm FinFET process and integrated on-package with optical devices and fiber-termination, achieves a PAM-4 data rate of 108 Gb/s with a record energy efficiency (EE) of 0.9 pJ/b—representing over  $1.7\times $  improvement in data rate compared to previously reported VCSEL-based transceivers. The optical transmitter supports 128 Gb/s PAM-4 operation, demonstrating a  $1.5\times $  data rate improvement and  $1.6\times $  better EE than the fastest reported integrated VCDRV.

Given the high performance and reconfigurability, field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based accelerators for MoE-ViTs emerge, delivering substantial gains over general-purpose processors. However, existing accelerators often fall short of efficiently managing the highly dynamic and sparse computation patterns, resulting in suboptimal tradeoffs between resource utilization and performance. To address the inefficiencies in deploying MoE-ViTs on FPGAs, we present MoE-Sched, a novel end-to-end accelerator that embraces a scheduling-centric design philosophy. Rather than optimizing isolated kernels, MoE-Sched coordinates multilevel scheduling, from fine-grained intrakernel streaming to module reuse and multidie mapping, to holistically balance latency, bandwidth (BW), and resource usage. We further integrate a hardware-aware quantization scheme tailored for streaming attention and sparse expert execution, preserving accuracy while minimizing overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that our accelerator achieves nearly 100 frames/s on M3ViT-tiny, a  $3.13\times $  improvement in throughput, and over 75% energy reduction compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) FPGA MoE accelerators, while maintaining less than 1% accuracy loss across vision benchmarks. Our implementation will be open-sourced.</description><author>IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems - new TOC</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 13:16:52 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11153520</guid></item><item><title>[IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits - new TOC] T-REX: Hardware–Software Co-Optimized Transformer Accelerator With Reduced External Memory Access and Enhanced Hardware Utilization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11148266</link><description>Transformers have emerged as the dominant neural network architecture thanks to their versatility- and human-level performance. However, a transformer model contains a very large number of parameters, which makes the overhead associated with external memory access (EMA), a critical bottleneck in computing systems. In light of this, we develop T-REX, a hardware accelerator for transformers with the goal of minimizing EMA. We develop a novel factorizing training method to reduce the parameter count substantially. We also combine a range of data compression techniques to effectively compress dense and sparse parameter matrices. Furthermore, we develop a dynamic batching technique, which can process multiple short inputs in parallel to increase parameter reuse. Last but not least, we develop a two-directional accessible register file (TRF) and the optimized dataflow to improve throughput and hardware utilization in many back-to-back matrix multiplications (MMs) commonly in a transformer model. The T-REX test chip is prototyped in Intel 16-nm FinFET. It achieves 68– $567~\mu $ s/token and 0.41– $3.95~\mu $ J/token, demonstrating 1–2 orders of magnitude improvement over the prior work.</description><author>IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits - new TOC</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 13:20:26 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11148266</guid></item><item><title>[IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems - new TOC] Real-Time ORB Accelerator for Embedded FPGA-Based SoCs With ROS Integration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11143580</link><description>As computer vision continues to expand across various application domains—including localization, mapping, object recognition, and 3-D reconstruction—feature extraction methods, such as oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF (ORB), have gained widespread adoption due to their rotation and scale invariance. However, existing efforts to accelerate these techniques through hardware implementations faced different challenges related to resource and power consumption demands, limiting their feasibility for low-power embedded devices. Accordingly, this article proposes a new scalable and efficient ORB accelerator, designed for low-power and resource-constrained environments. It introduces a novel and efficient architecture that exploits quantization of the feature orientation angle into discrete rotation sectors. A complete robot operating system (ROS) node based on the proposed ORB accelerator is also deployed, providing seamless integration with other computer vision-enabled systems. When compared to other state-of-the-art solutions, the proposed system, implemented on an embedded system-on-chip (SoC) with a low-cost field-programmable gate array (FPGA), offers energy efficiency improvements between  $6.7\times $  and  $16.2\times $ , while requiring fewer hardware resources.</description><author>IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems - new TOC</author><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 13:18:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11143580</guid></item><item><title>[Recent Articles in PRX Energy] Reconstructions and Dynamics of $β$-Lithium Thiophosphate Surfaces</title><link>http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/5hf9-hlj6</link><description>Author(s): Hanna Türk, Davide Tisi, and Michele Ceriotti&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Machine-learning-based molecular dynamics simulations of the solid electrolyte &lt;math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mi&gt;β&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/math&gt;-Li&lt;math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;mn&gt;3&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/math&gt;PS&lt;math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;mn&gt;4&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/math&gt; under realistic conditions reveal dynamic surface structure and reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height="" src="https://cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/PRXENERGY/key_images/10.1103/5hf9-hlj6.png" width="200" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[PRX Energy 4, 033010] Published Tue Aug 26, 2025</description><author>Recent Articles in PRX Energy</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/5hf9-hlj6</guid></item><item><title>[IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems - new TOC] A 28-GHz 2-by-2 MIMO Transceiver Deploying Transformer Gain Equalization Technique for 5G New Radio</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11132335</link><description>This article presents a 2-by-2 multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transceiver array operating at 28 GHz to enable fifth-generation (5G) new radio (NR) communication, which is an extended work of the article.

To fully utilize the extensive resources available on modern high-end FPGAs, it is essential to optimize the allocation of multiple applications on a single device.

It combines this with a sequential decision-making strategy and an in-circuit exploration flow based on dynamic partial reconfiguration (DPR) to drastically speed up the exploration of large design spaces. Experimental evaluations across a wide range of representative scenarios, conducted on a real prototyping platform using an AMD Alveo U55C FPGA board, demonstrate that FARMER consistently identifies a feasible solution while exploring less than  $\mathbf {0.012\%}$  of the total design space.</description><author>IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems - new TOC</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 13:18:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11118291</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents] Macrophage Phenotype Detection Methodology on Textured Surfaces via Nuclear Morphology Using Machine Learning</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aidi.202500055?af=R</link><description>Advanced Intelligent Discovery, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 08:40:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/aidi.202500055</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents] Topology‐Aware Machine Learning for High‐Throughput Screening of MOFs in C8 Aromatic Separation</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aidi.202500079?af=R</link><description>Advanced Intelligent Discovery, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 10:45:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/aidi.202500079</guid></item><item><title>[IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs - new TOC] Thermal Inkjet Pumping and Flow Rate Estimation for Microfluidics in Lab-on-CMOS Packages</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11087437</link><description>In this brief, we present the use of a thermal inkjet (TIJ) die as an active micropump for lab-on-CMOS applications, with the goal of replacing off-chip syringe pumps with in-package fluidic control. A combination of wafer-level molding and 3D-printing is used to co-locate a TIJ integrated circuit (IC) pump with package-level microfluidics and electrodes for impedance sensing in a single planar package. The TIJ IC acts as a pull-pump, ejecting waste solution and pulling new solution across a set of gold electrodes on the package surface; flow rate is controlled directly by the TIJ firing rate. These electrodes can be used to measure impedance, such as for electrical cell counting, and we further characterize the ability to electrically estimate volumetric flow rate from transient signals and known geometry. To demonstrate, impedance measurements of 3, 4.5, and 6 $\mu $ m polystyrene beads in solution were performed at droplet ejection rates ranging from 63-500 Hz, and an adjustable flow rate of 29.4pl/s/Hz is shown, estimated using both electrical and optical tracking methods.

Many preclinical studies and clinical applications urgently require a portable, high-quality, low-cost, and fast imaging system. Thus, translating advanced image reconstruction algorithms into hardware implementations is highly desired. However, existing iterative PA image reconstructions, although exhibit higher accuracy than the delay-and-sum algorithm, suffer from high computational cost. In this paper, we introduce a novel model-based hardware architecture for palm-size PA tomography (palm-PAT), aiming at enhancing both the speed and performance of image reconstruction at a much lower system cost. To achieve this, we propose an innovative data reuse method that significantly reduces the consumption of hardware storage resources, achieving a reduction of approximately 75% in hardware storage requirements. We conducted experiments utilizing the FPGA implementation of the algorithm, using phantom, human finger data in vivo and ex vivo breast tumor data to verify the feasibility of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that our proposed architecture can substantially reduce system cost while maintaining high imaging performance. The novel hardware architecture design of the model-based algorithm achieves a speedup of up to approximately 270 times compared to the CPU, while the corresponding energy efficiency ratio is improved by more than 2700 times.</description><author>IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers - new TOC</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2025 05:18:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11075611</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents] Autonomous Machine Learning‐Based Classification and Arrangement of Submillimeter Objects Using a Capillary Force Gripper</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aidi.202500068?af=R</link><description>Advanced Intelligent Discovery, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2025 08:01:30 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/aidi.202500068</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents] Universally Accurate or Specifically Inadequate?

However, as the scale of maps and paths increases, achieving faster and more efficient computations becomes challenging due to constraints in memory and computational resources. In this paper, we present a hardware architecture for global path planning utilizing block searching A* (BSA*) for AMRs. The BSA* designates surrounding nodes as blocks and searching nodes for expansion with collision detection based on block-based jump point search (JPS(B)). This reduces the amount of stored data, enables faster map scanning, and provides advantages in parallelized architecture. The BSA* accelerator, consisting of a memory controller based on heap sorting and a parallelized collision detector, was implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). In the benchmarks for grid-based pathfinding, experimental results showed that BSA* stored 83.2% less data compared to A* and BSA* accelerator demonstrated real-time performance, ranging from 0.528 ms to 2.983 ms, successfully verifying the feasibility of real-time path planning with a block searching approach.</description><author>IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers - new TOC</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 13:16:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11073187</guid></item><item><title>[IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers - new TOC] A General Efficiency Enhancement Method for Compact Broadband Rectifiers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11062920</link><description>This paper presents a general efficiency enhancement method for compact broadband rectifiers. First, a simple LCR model is employed to characterize the frequency-dependent parasitic effects of Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) in broadband. Subsequently, based on the LCR model, a compact rectifier circuit configuration is proposed to minimize impedance mismatch in broadband, thereby significantly improving the rectification efficiency. To validate the proposed approach, two representative rectifier prototypes are designed, fabricated, and measured. The measured results show that Rectifier I achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 70% across 0.5–2.5 GHz under 20 dBm input power with a  ${}\,1000{\Omega }$  load, while Rectifier II attains a PCE above 64% from 1.1 to 5.4 GHz under 10 dBm input power with the same load. Compared with state-of-the-art designs, the proposed rectifiers exhibit superior PCE performance while achieving a fractional bandwidth (FBW) exceeding 100%. Notably, the proposed efficiency enhancement technique is suitable for most broadband rectifier designs, such as diverse rectifier topologies, SBD types, input power levels, and load conditions.</description><author>IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers - new TOC</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 13:19:17 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11062920</guid></item><item><title>[IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs - new TOC] A Low-Complexity and Reconfigurable Design for Nonlinear Function Approximation in Transformers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11063402</link><description>Nonlinear function approximation plays a critical role in the area efficiency and accuracy of transformer-based hardware accelerators. Functions such as softmax, GELU, SiLU, and layer normalization require high numerical precision, introducing significant hardware complexity. Existing approaches reduce cost through functional integration but suffer from area overhead–particularly due to cubic preprocessing in GELU approximations. This brief proposes a novel low-complexity successive approximation technique that minimizes preprocessing complexity and compensates for errors across stages. A reconfigurable architecture is introduced to support softmax, GELU, SiLU, and square root operations within a unified hardware design. Evaluated on BERT-base models, the proposed solution achieves up to  $2.00\times $  and  $3.99\times $  improvements in area-normalized throughput on ASIC for softmax and GELU, respectively, and a  $1.52\times $  improvement in LUT-normalized throughput on FPGA, while maintaining model accuracy. For SiLU, our method reduces approximation error by 27.2% and improves LLaMA3.2-1B perplexity by 0.56% over the prior state-of-the-art design.</description><author>IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs - new TOC</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 13:19:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11063402</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents] A Machine Learning Model for Interpretable PECVD Deposition Rate Prediction</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aidi.202500074?af=R</link><description>Advanced Intelligent Discovery, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 08:27:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/aidi.202500074</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents] Feature Selection for Machine Learning‐Driven Accelerated Discovery and Optimization in Emerging Photovoltaics: A Review</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aidi.202500022?af=R</link><description>Advanced Intelligent Discovery, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 08:15:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/aidi.202500022</guid></item><item><title>[IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs - new TOC] Smart Watchdog for RISC-V: A Novel Spiking Neural Network Approach to Fault Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11051055</link><description>Watchdog mechanisms must detect permanent and transient faults with minimal power and area overheads, but their own reliability is vital, as failures can jeopardize system integrity. This brief introduces a novel smart watchdog paradigm based on spiking neural networks (SNNs), where SNNs have previously been demonstrated to offer low-power and area-efficient solutions. The proposed smart watchdog is trained to monitor control flow at the execute stage of an example RISC-V processor, achieving a high fault coverage of 98%, independent of the software application executed. Notably, it detects faults that go unnoticed by the RISC-V processor’s existing trap handler. An FPGA-based implementation validates the smart watchdog’s in-circuit fault detection capabilities when integrated with a RISC-V processor. An extended discussion explores control flow and feature extraction in the RISC-V architecture, and also evaluates the practical implementation of a SNN-based approach.</description><author>IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs - new TOC</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 13:46:37 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11051055</guid></item><item><title>[IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers - new TOC] A Symmetrical Impedance Compensation Configuration for Optimized IPT Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11049914</link><description>This paper presents a double-sided Z-configuration-based compensation network for an inductive power transfer (IPT) system for electric vehicles (EVs) with detailed analysis and optimization factors as an alternative to the double-sided LCC configuration. The contributions of the proposed article are as follows: (a) a double-sided Z-compensation configuration is developed, which provides a lower voltage and current stress on the passive components in comparison with double-sided LCC compensation; it has inherent zero phase angle properties for minimizing losses and improving system efficiency; (b) the Z-Z configuration achieves a load-independent constant voltage output and constant transmitting current; (c) additionally, the optimized compensation factors for the primary and secondary sides are derived for maximum inter-coil efficiency. It is evident that fine-tuning the compensation factors can minimize copper losses and ensure high efficiency over a wide load range, achieving up to 93.37% efficiency at optimal conditions. Experimental results from the 1 kW laboratory prototype validate the proposed designs, demonstrating comparable power transfer performance with lower losses and an effective and alternative solution for double-sided LCC-LCC-based higher-power IPT systems.</description><author>IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers - new TOC</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 13:17:27 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11049914</guid></item><item><title>[ACS Materials Au: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Historical Data Mining Deep Dive into Machine Learning-Aided 2D Materials Research in Electrochemical Applications</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsmaterialsau.5c00030</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acsmaterialsau.5c00030/asset/images/medium/mg5c00030_0020.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Materials Au&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialsau.5c00030&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>ACS Materials Au: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 15:22:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsmaterialsau.5c00030</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents] Machine Learning‐Assisted Infectious Disease Detection in Low‐Income Areas: Toward Rapid Triage of Dengue and Zika Virus Using Open‐Source Hardware</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aidi.202500049?af=R</link><description>Advanced Intelligent Discovery, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 08:20:28 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/aidi.202500049</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents] What to Make and How to Make It: Combining Machine Learning and Statistical Learning to Design New Materials</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aidi.202500033?af=R</link><description>Advanced Intelligent Discovery, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 08:36:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/aidi.202500033</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents] Predicting High‐Resolution Spatial and Spectral Features in Mass Spectrometry Imaging with Machine Learning and Multimodal Data Fusion</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aidi.202500021?af=R</link><description>Advanced Intelligent Discovery, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 08:10:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/aidi.202500021</guid></item><item><title>[Chinese Chemical Society: CCS Chemistry: Table of Contents] Efficient Pure Organic Near-Infrared Room-Temperature Phosphorescence Based on n/π Orbital Decoupling</title><link>https://ccs-stag.literatumonline.com/doi/abs/10.31635/ccschem.025.202405319?af=R</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.chinesechemsoc.org/cms/asset/91960c98-a47a-4293-846c-f1e9b670d740/keyimage.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;CCS Chemistry, Ahead of Print.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI:10.31635/ccschem.025.202405319&lt;/div&gt;Developing pure organic room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials remains an enormous challenge, especially for efficient near-infrared (NIR) RTP materials.

In recent years, due to the rapid development of neural networks, the performance of denoising algorithms has seen a substantial improvement. However, state-of-the-art denoising models often entail large-scale models and heavy computational requirements, making deployment challenging. In addition, we have observed that the location of denoisers in the entire image processing pipeline has a significant impact on resource consumption and denoising effectiveness. Deploying the denoiser closer to the image acquisition stage will be more effective in separating noise from the image. In this article, we propose a near-sensor compute-in-memory macro for visual perception denoising (Denoise on Sensor, DoS) along with its corresponding Edge Denoise U-net (EDU) architecture. DoS employs a mixed-signal circuit implementation for neural network inference, offering a notable advantage in terms of high speed and low power consumption compared to FPGA- or GPU-based approaches, making it feasible to deploy denoising tasks at the near-sensor edge. The simulation results show that the energy efficiency of DoS can reach 21.98 TOPS/W, and EDU deployed on DoS can achieve around 30 dB PSNR and 0.83 SSIM on KODAK, BSD300 and SET14 datasets.</description><author>IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems - new TOC</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 13:16:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11004071</guid></item><item><title>[IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems - new TOC] A Sub- 10 μs In-Memory-Search Collision Detection Accelerator Based on RRAM-TCAMs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11002546</link><description>Collision detection can account for over 90% of the total calculation time in motion planning, which makes it critical to optimize the collision detection process. Previous hardware accelerators can hardly maintain fast computation speed for real-time collision detection while supporting a large roadmap. In this work, we present a novel in-memory-search accelerator. The accelerator achieves an impressive sub- $10~\mu $ s time for collision detection in 800-MB scale roadmaps with 100000 edges. Such accelerator leverages an in-memory-search architecture that can perform search operation in massively parallel manner with low energy consumption. It is powered by ternary content-addressable memories (TCAMs) based on large-scale nonvolatile resistive random-access memory (RRAM) arrays, which not only store a large roadmap on chip, perform look-up table function in a single clock cycle to accelerate collision detection by combining with the unique logic encoding scheme. Importantly, the RRAM-based TCAM eliminates the need for extensive data transfer between memory and computing units during collision detection, leading to significant energy and delay saving. As the pioneering TCAM-based in-memory-search accelerator for collision detection, the structure achieves 210– $2225\times $  times speedup compared with previous application-specific integrated circuit-based accelerators, and more than 33 $879\times $  times speedup compared with CPU-based collision detection. Such accelerator well exceeds the speed requirement for collision detection (&lt;1 ms), and is suitable for a number of applications, such as robot motion planning in dynamic environment, animation, machining and manufacturing.</description><author>IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems - new TOC</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 13:18:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11002546</guid></item><item><title>[IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems - new TOC] PRO-TIME: Prerouting Optimization-Aware Timing Prediction via Multimodal Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11002564</link><description>Fast and accurate prerouting timing prediction is crucial in the very-large-scale integration (VLSI) design flow. Existing machine learning (ML)-assisted prerouting timing evaluators neglect the impact of timing optimization, which may render their approaches impractical in real circuit design flows. To address the challenges posed by timing optimization, we propose PRO-TIME, a prerouting optimization-aware timing prediction framework that is driven by multimodal learning. Specifically, we propose a novel endpoint embedding framework that integrates both netlist and layout information. A customized graph neural network (GNN) model is used for extracting endpoint-wise netlist information, which is motivated by the delay propagation process. Meanwhile, we apply the U-net model with a masking strategy to extract endpoint-wise layout information. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive layout mask adjustment scheme to boost performance by leveraging the layout information more effectively. Comprehensive experiments on large-scale RISC-V designs with advanced 7-nm technology node demonstrate the superiority of our model compared to the state-of-the-art prerouting timing evaluators.</description><author>IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems - new TOC</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 13:18:19 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11002564</guid></item><item><title>[IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems - new TOC] Customized Retrieval Augmented Generation and Benchmarking for EDA Tool Documentation QA</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10994463</link><description>Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) improves the accuracy and dependability of generative AI models by integrating factual information from external databases. This technique is widely used in tasks involving document-grounded question answering (QA). While these RAG systems are extensively pretrained on general-purpose documents, they face considerable limitations when applied to specialized, knowledge-intensive fields such as electronic design automation (EDA). This article addresses such issue by proposing a customized RAG framework along with three domain-specific techniques for EDA tool documentation QA, including a contrastive learning scheme for text embedding model fine-tuning, a reranker distilled from proprietary large language model (LLM), and a generative LLM fine-tuned with high-quality domain corpus. To further unleash the extraordinary language capacity of LLMs in the domain of EDA-tool documentation QA, we propose to train LLMs as the reranker model with our customized two-stage traning scheme, which consists of the point-wise instruction tuning stage and the pair-wise learn-to-rank (LTR) stage. Finally, we have developed and released a documentation QA evaluation benchmark, ORD-QA, for OpenROAD, an advanced RTL-to-GDSII design platform. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed RAG flow and techniques have achieved superior performance on ORD-QA as well as on a commercial tool, compared with state-of-the-arts. Furthermore, compared with the SOTA reranker models, our LLM reranker prominently improves the document retrieval accuracy and thus leads to better QA quality. The ORD-QA benchmark and the training dataset for our customized RAG flow are open-source at https://github.com/lesliepy99/RAG-EDA.</description><author>IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems - new TOC</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 13:17:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10994463</guid></item><item><title>[IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems - new TOC] Para-Pipe: Exploiting Hierarchical Operator Parallelism of ML Computational Graphs on SoCs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10993487</link><description>As edge-based deep learning applications become more complex, optimizing performance on heterogeneous System-on-Chips (SoCs) presents unique challenges. Traditional pipelining techniques distributing the computation across different on-chip processing units, while effective for throughput, do not address the latency demands posed by modern neural networks with complex interdependencies and extensive operator parallelism. There is a potential in leveraging operator parallelism to enable concurrent execution across multiple processing units, thereby reducing inference latency. However, prioritizing pipelining or parallel execution often necessitates a compromise, where optimizing one performance metric adversely impacts the other. This article introduces Para-Pipe, a hierarchical mapping framework that integrates intra- and interstage operator parallelism within a pipelined architecture. Para-Pipe navigates the tradeoff between throughput and latency by selectively fine-tuning parallelism levels within and across pipeline stages. This strategy can significantly reduce interprocessor communication overhead, significantly improving energy efficiency. Our evaluation demonstrates that Para-Pipe generates multiple Pareto-optimal configurations, achieving a balance between throughput and latency on an Amlogic SoC equipped with ARM big.LITTLE CPUs and GPU, as well as the Black Sesame Technology SoC featuring a deep learning accelerator and two DSPs. More importantly, throughput-optimized configurations under Para-Pipe on Amlogic SoC show an average energy efficiency improvement of 11.0% over purely pipelined strategies and 23.3% relative to nonpipelined parallel execution.</description><author>IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems - new TOC</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 13:17:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10993487</guid></item><item><title>[IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems - new TOC] Bursting Firings in Memristive Hopfield Neural Network With Image Encryption and Hardware Implementation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10990114</link><description>By integrating memristors into a Hopfield neural network (HNN), a diverse range of dynamical behavior can be generated, which has significant implications for modeling and biomimetic applications of artificial neurons. However, research on the firing dynamics of HNNs remains relatively limited. In response, a memristive tri-neurons HNN (MTN-HNN) was constructed, with the synapse of the second neuron replaced by the proposed memristor. A theoretical and experimental investigation of the dynamics of this neural network was conducted using general analytical tools, such as phase diagrams, Lyapunov exponents, bifurcation diagrams, and others. Experimental results indicate that the dynamics of the MTN-HNN is influenced by the internal parameters of the memristor, enabling the network to extend attractors in up to two directions and thereby form grid multiscrolls. Notably, the MTN-HNN exhibits various firing modes, including periodic and chaotic bursting. Finally, an encryption scheme was proposed to demonstrate the potential of the MTN-HNN, and both the custom digital circuits and the encryption scheme were successfully implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA).</description><author>IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems - new TOC</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 13:17:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10990114</guid></item></channel></rss>
