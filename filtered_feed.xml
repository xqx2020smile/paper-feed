Abstract: When we consider canonical averages for classical discrete systems, typically referred to as substitutional alloys, the map from many-body interatomic interactions to thermodynamic equilibrium configurations generally exhibits complicated nonlinearity. This canonical nonlinearity is fundamentally rooted in deviations of the discrete configurational density of states (CDOS) from continuous Gaussian families, and has conventionally been characterized by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence on discrete statistical manifold. Thus, the previous works inevitablly missed intrinsic nonlinearities induced by discretization of Gaussian families, which remains invisible within conventional information-geometric descriptions. In the present work, we identify and quantify such unavoidable canonical nonlinearity by employing the 2-Wasserstein distance with a cost function aligned with the Fisher metric for Gaussian families. We derive an explicit expression for the Wasserstein distance in the limit of vanishing discretization scale d to 0: W2 = d*sqrt(Tr(Gamma)^(-1)/12), where Gamma denotes covariance matrix of the CDOS. We further show that this limiting Wasserstein distance admits a clear geometric interpretation on the statistical manifold, equivalent to a KL divergence associated with the expected parallel translations of continuous Gaussian. Our framework thus provides a transport-information-geometric characterization of discretization-induced nonlinearity in classical discrete systems, with future potential applications to configurational thermodynamics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08381v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dynamical stability by spin transfer in nearly isotropic magnets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08738</link><description>arXiv:2601.08738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin transfer torques (STTs) control magnetisation by electric currents, enabling a range of nano-scale spintronic applications. They can destabilise the equilibrium magnetisation state by counteracting magnetic relaxation. Here, we maximise the STT effect through a dedicated growth-annealing protocol for CoFeB thin films, such that magnetic anisotropies originating from the interface and shape almost cancel each other. The nearly isotropic magnets enable low-current dynamical stabilisation of the magnetisation in the direction opposite to an applied magnetic field, thereby realising a spintronic analogue of the Kapitza pendulum. In an intermediate current regime, the STT drives large magnetisation vector fluctuations that cover the entire Bloch sphere. The continuous variable associated with the stochastic magnetisation direction may serve as a resource for probabilistic computing and neuromorphic hardware. Our results establish isotropic magnets as a platform to study as-yet-uncharted, far-from-equilibrium spin dynamics including anti-magnonics, with promising implications for unconventional computing paradigms.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08738v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Magnetic ground state of a Jeff = 1/2 based frustrated triangular lattice antiferromagnet</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07194</link><description>arXiv:2504.07194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The subtle interplay between competing degrees of freedom, crystal electric fields, and spin correlations can lead to exotic quantum states in 4f ion-based frustrated triangular lattice antiferromagnets. We present the crystal structure, thermodynamic and muon spin relaxation ({\mu}SR) studies of the 4f ion-based frustrated magnet Ba4YbReWO12, wherein Yb3+ ions constitute a triangular lattice. The magnetic susceptibility does not show any signature of spin freezing down to 1.9 K or long-range magnetic ordering down to 0.4 K. The low-temperature Curie-Weiss fit to the inverse magnetic susceptibility data reveals a weak antiferromagnetic exchange interaction, which is corroborated by the fit of magnetic specific heat data following the J1-J2 model with the nearest neighbor exchange interaction of J1 = -0.197 K between the Jeff = 1/2 states of the Yb3+ moments in the lowest Kramers doublet. The lowest Kramers ground state doublet is well separated from the first excited state with a gap of 278 K, as evidenced by our {\mu}SR experiments that support the realization of Jeff = 1/2 at low temperatures. The specific heat experiments do not detect a phase transition down to 56 mK. The magnetic specific heat shows a broad maximum 90 mK suggesting a disordered ground state with short range spin correlations. The associated magnetic entropy release at low temperatures is consistent with that expected for the Jeff = 1/2 state. The zero-field {\mu}SR measurements show neither the signature of spin freezing nor a phase transition, at least down to 43 mK. Our results suggest a dynamic, disordered ground state in this Jeff = 1/2 frustrated triangular lattice antiferromagnet.

Abstract: For disordered systems within the random first-order transition (RFOT) universality class, such as structural glasses and certain spin glasses, the role played by activated relaxation processes is rich to the point of perplexity. Over the last decades, various efforts have attempted to formalize and systematize such processes in terms of instantons similar to the nucleation droplets of first-order phase transitions. In particular, Kirkpatrick, Thirumalai, and Wolynes proposed in the late '80s an influential nucleation theory of relaxation in structural glasses. Already within this picture, however, the resulting structures are far from the compact objects expected from the classical droplet description. In addition, an altogether different type of single-particle hopping-like instantons has recently been isolated in molecular simulations. Landscape studies of mean-field spin glass models have further revealed that simple saddle crossing does not capture relaxation in these systems. We present here a landscape-agnostic study of rare dynamical events, which delineates the richness of instantons in these systems. Our work not only captures the structure of metastable states, but also identifies the point of irreversibility, beyond which activated relaxation processes become a fait accompli. An interpretation of the associated landscape features is articulated, thus charting a path toward a complete understanding of RFOT instantons.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.00107v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Universal scaling of microwave dissipation in superconducting circuits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08953</link><description>arXiv:2507.08953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Improving the coherence of superconducting qubits is essential for advancing quantum technologies. While superconductors are theoretically perfect conductors, they consistently exhibit residual energy dissipation when driven by microwave currents, limiting coherence times. Here, we report a universal scaling between microwave dissipation and the superfluid density, a bulk property of superconductors related to charge carrier density and disorder. Our analysis spans a wide range of superconducting materials and device geometries, from highly disordered amorphous films to ultra-clean systems with record-high quality factors, including resonators, 3D cavities, and transmon qubits. This scaling reveals an intrinsic bulk dissipation channel, independent of surface dielectric losses, that originates from a universal density of nonequilibrium quasiparticles trapped within disorder-induced spatial variations of the superconducting gap. Our findings identify an empirical coherence limit associated with intrinsic material properties and provide a data-driven basis for materials selection in future superconducting quantum circuits.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.08953v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Optical Detection and Manipulation of Pseudospin Orders in Wigner Crystals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21097</link><description>arXiv:2512.21097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Wigner-crystal states of two-dimensional electrons, the spin ordering remains poorly understood. The small energy differences between candidate spin orders make theoretical studies less reliable, and probing magnetic order at a nonzero wave vector is experimentally challenging. In modern realizations of Wigner crystals, the electronic spin degree of freedom is often replaced by a valley pseudospin associated with nonzero Berry curvature. The resulting anomalous velocity couples the electrons' pseudospin texture to their orbital vibration. We show that this mechanism enables optical detection of pseudospin orders in Wigner crystals by producing sharp signatures in the terahertz optical conductivity. For example, antiferromagnetic pseudospin order enables light to excite collective electronic vibrations at the ordering wave vector, generating a characteristic absorption peak. Based on the same principle, we further show that a strong optical drive generates an effective potential that reshapes the pseudospin energy landscape, inducing phase transitions to stripe antiferromagnetic states. These results point to a route for optical detection and control of spin order via its coupling to orbital motion.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21097v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Universal time-temperature scaling of conductivities in random site energy and associated random barrier model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07731</link><description>arXiv:2601.07731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Universal time-temperature scaling of conductivity spectra in disordered solids has been explained by thermally activated hopping of noninteracting particles over random energy barriers. An open problem is whether the random barrier model accounts for site energy disorder in real materials. Through mapping many-particle hopping in a disordered site energy landscape to that of independent particles in a barrier landscape, we show that time-temperature scaling is correctly described by the associated barrier model in the low temperature limit. However, the site energy model displays good scaling behavior at substantially higher temperatures than the barrier model, in agreement with experimental observations. Extending the mapping to different types of mobile charge carriers allows us to understand why time-temperature superposition can be absent in mixed alkali glasses.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07731v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Stochastic synaptic dynamics under learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13846</link><description>arXiv:2508.13846v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning is based on synaptic plasticity, which affects and is driven by neural activity. Because pre- and postsynaptic spiking activity is shaped by randomness, the synaptic weights follow a stochastic process, requiring a probabilistic framework to capture the noisy synaptic dynamics. We consider a paradigmatic supervised learning example: a presynaptic neural population impinging in a sequence of episodes on a recurrent network of integrate-and-fire neurons through synapses undergoing spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with additive potentiation and multiplicative depression. We first analytically compute the drift- and diffusion coefficients for a single synapse within a single episode (microscopic dynamics), mapping the true jump process to a Langevin and the associated Fokker-Planck equations. Leveraging new analytical tools, we include spike-time--resolving cross-correlations between pre- and postsynaptic spikes, which corrects substantial deviations seen in standard theories purely based on firing rates. We then apply this microdynamical description to the network setup in which hetero-associations are trained over one-shot episodes into a feed-forward matrix of STDP synapses connecting to neurons of the recurrent network (macroscopic dynamics). By mapping statistically distinct synaptic populations to instances of the single-synapse process above, we self-consistently determine the joint neural and synaptic dynamics and, ultimately, the time course of memory degradation and the memory capacity. We demonstrate that specifically in the relevant case of sparse coding, our theory can quantitatively capture memory capacities which are strongly overestimated if spike-time--resolving cross-correlations are ignored.

Abstract: In many cases, the behavior of physical memristive devices can be relatively well captured by using a single internal state variable. This study investigates the low-power control of first-order memristive devices to derive the most energy-efficient protocols for programming their resistances. A unique yet general approach to optimizing the switching transitions in devices of this kind is introduced. For pedagogical purposes, without loss of generality, the proposed control paradigm is applied to a couple of differential algebraic equation sets for voltage-controlled devices, specifically Kvatinsky's Voltage ThrEshold Adaptive Memristor mathematical description and Miranda's and Sune's dynamic balance model. It is demonstrated that, depending upon intrinsic physical properties of the device, captured in the model formulas and parameter setting, and upon constraints on programming time and voltages, the optimal protocol for either of the two switching scenarios may require the application of a single square voltage pulse of height set to a certain level within the admissible range across a fraction or entire given programming time interval, or of some more involved voltage stimulus of unique polarity, including analogue continuous waveforms that can be approximated by trains of square voltage pulses of different heights, over the entire programming time interval. The practical implications of these research findings are significant, as the development of energy-efficient protocols to program memristive devices, resolving the so-called voltage-time dilemma in the device physics community, is a subject under intensive and extensive studies across the academic community and industry.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.15620v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Modeling phononic band gap in microstructured solids using the Riemann-Cartan geometric framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05402</link><description>arXiv:2601.05402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses the modeling of acoustic wave fields in microstructured elastic solids within the framework of Riemann-Cartan geometry. We consider a scenario in which microstructural deformations occur significantly faster than those of the bulk material. This time-scale separation creates apparent geometric incompatibilities at the macroscopic level, even in the absence of permanent inelastic deformation or damage. We formalize this phenomenon by using a non-holonomic frame field to represent macroscopic elastic deformations and an associated torsion field to characterize the resulting geometric incompatibilities. The spatial components of the torsion tensor quantify the instantaneous geometric incompatibility of the macroscopic deformations, while its temporal components capture the inertial effects arising from the reversible energy exchange between the micro- and macro-scales. A key finding is that the model's dispersion relation predicts a complete frequency band gap. Furthermore, the governing equations exhibit a mathematical analogy to Maxwell's equations, potentially bridging the modeling of phononic and photonic metamaterials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05402v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Bio-RV: Low-Power Resource-Efficient RISC-V Processor for Biomedical Applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08428</link><description>arXiv:2601.08428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents Bio-RV, a compact and resource-efficient RISC-V processor intended for biomedical control applications, such as accelerator-based biomedical SoCs and implantable pacemaker systems. The proposed Bio-RV is a multi-cycle RV32I core that provides explicit execution control and external instruction loading with capabilities that enable controlled firmware deployment, ASIC bring-up, and post-silicon testing. In addition to coordinating accelerator configuration and data transmission in heterogeneous systems, Bio-RV is designed to function as a lightweight host controller, handling interfaces with pacing, sensing, electrogram (EGM), telemetry, and battery management modules. With 708 LUTs and 235 flip-flops on FPGA prototypes, Bio-RV, implemented in a 180 nm CMOS technology, operate at 50 MHz and feature a compact hardware footprint. According to post-layout results, the proposed architectural decisions align with minimal energy use. Ultimately, Bio-RV prioritises deterministic execution, minimal hardware complexity, and integration flexibility over peak computing speed to meet the demands of ultra-low-power, safety-critical biomedical systems.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08428v1</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Abstract: Phase transitions are omnipresent in modern condensed matter physics and its applications. In solids, phase transformations typically occur by nucleation and growth under non-equilibrium conditions. Under constant external conditions, $\textit{e.g.}$, constant heating temperature and pressure, the nucleation and growth dynamics are often thought of as spatially and temporally independent. Here, $\textit{in-situ}$ Bragg X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) reveals nanoscale spatial and dynamical heterogeneity in the perovskite to brownmillerite topotactic phase transformation in La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$CoO$_3$ (LSCO) thin films under constant reducing conditions over a time-span of multiple hours. Specifically, a timescale associated with domain growth remains stable, with a corresponding domain wall speed of $v_d = 6 \pm 0.5 \times10^{-4}$ nm/s ($2 \pm 0.2$ nm/h), while a slower timescale, associated with temperature driven de-pinning of domains, leads to accelerating dynamics with timescales following an aging power law with exponent $-2.2 \pm 0.5$. The experiment demonstrates that Bragg XPCS is a powerful tool to study nanoscale dynamics in phase transformations. The results are relevant for phase engineering of phase-change devices, as they show that nanoscale dynamics, linked to domain and domain-wall motion, can continuously evolve and speed up with time, even hours after the initiation of the phase transformation, with potential repercussions on electrical performance.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06365v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Two-Level System Microwave Losses in Chemically Pure Bulk Niobium Oxide Samples</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06668</link><description>arXiv:2601.06668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Losses from two-level systems (TLS) associated with amorphous oxides remain one of the primary limitations to the performance of superconducting resonators in quantum information science and precision measurements. Niobium resonators are widely used for these purposes, yet niobium's natural oxide stack contains various types of oxides whose relative contributions to TLS loss have not been clearly distinguished. Here, we use a superconducting 3D microwave cavity to measure chemically pure oxides \ch{Nb2O5} and \ch{NbO2}. Using this approach, we directly compare the loss characteristics of \ch{Nb2O5} and \ch{NbO2}. Our measurements show that the \ch{Nb2O5} oxide exhibits TLS-like power and temperature dependence. Analogous measurements performed on \ch{NbO2} do not show any detectable TLS loss signatures. These results provide direct experimental evidence that \ch{Nb2O5} is the dominant TLS host in niobium resonators and establish a general framework for separating oxide-specific dissipation channels</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06668v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A phase field model of the effects of dislocation microstructure on grain boundary motion during recrystallization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06669</link><description>arXiv:2601.06669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The internal energy associated with the defect microstructure of strongly deformed crystals provides an important driving force for grain boundary motion during recrystallization. Typical dislocation microstructures are strongly heterogeneous and this heterogeneity affects the motion of recrystallization boundaries. In this study, a phase field model for microstructure evolution encompassing the evolution of both dislocation densities and grain order parameters is formulated. The model is employed to generate typical dislocation microstructures exhibiting multiscale features such as incidental and geometrically necessary dislocation walls. It is then used to study the motion of recrystallization boundaries in the associated complex defect energy 'landscape'. Results are compared to experimental observations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06669v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] In-context learning emerges in chemical reaction networks without attention</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06712</link><description>arXiv:2601.06712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether chemical processes can perform in-context learning (ICL), a mode of computation typically associated with transformer architectures. ICL allows a system to infer task-specific rules from a sequence of examples without relying solely on fixed parameters. Traditional ICL relies on a pairwise attention mechanism which is not obviously implementable in chemical systems. However, we show theoretically and numerically that chemical processes can achieve ICL through a mechanism we call subspace projection, in which the entire input vector is mapped onto comparison subspaces, with the dominant projection determining the computational output. We illustrate this mechanism analytically in small chemical systems and show numerically that performance is robust to input encoding and dynamical choices, with the number of tunable degrees of freedom in the input encoding as a key limitation. Our results provide a blueprint for realizing ICL in chemical or other physical media and suggest new directions for designing adaptive synthetic chemical systems and understanding possible biological computation in cells.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06712v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Self-oscillations induced by self-induced torque in magnetic double tunnel junction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07300</link><description>arXiv:2601.07300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-oscillations of the magnetization due to self-induced torque (SIT) in a magnetic double tunnel junction that consists of perpendicularly polarized, pinned and free layers is investigated along with the field-like torque (FLT). The associated Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski equation is numerically analysed to exhibit the oscillations of magnetization driven by the current. From the numerical analysis, we show that the SIT is essential to generate os- cillations in the order of GHz and without it the magnetization reaches steady state after exhibiting switching. Without FLT, the frequency of the oscilla- tions decreases with the current while the power of oscillations increases. In the presence of the negative strength of the FLT the power spectral density confirms that the frequency, power and the Q-factor increase with the current. Also the tunability range and the rate at which the frequency enhances increase with the magnitude of the FLT.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07300v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Sliding Charge Density Wave observed through Band Structure</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07417</link><description>arXiv:2601.07417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An incommensurate CDW may have the ability to slide, i.e., to generate an excess of current when the system is submitted to an external field. Sliding phenomenon is closely related to deformation of the periodic lattice distortion associated to the CDW. In principle, however, the sliding state can also be observed through the band structure.

Abstract: The Hopfield model, originally inspired by spin-glass physics, occupies a central place at the intersection of statistical mechanics, neural networks, and modern artificial intelligence. Despite its conceptual simplicity and broad applicability -- from associative memory to near-optimal solutions of combinatorial optimization problems -- it is rarely integrated into standard undergraduate physics curricula. In this paper, we present the Hopfield model as a pedagogically rich framework that naturally unifies core topics from undergraduate statistical physics, dynamical systems, linear algebra, and computational methods. We provide a concise and illustrated theoretical introduction grounded in familiar physics concepts, analyze the model's energy function, dynamics, and pattern stability, and discuss practical aspects of simulation, including a freely available simulation code. To support instruction, we conclude with classroom-ready example problems designed to mirror research practice. By explicitly connecting fundamental physics to contemporary AI applications, this work aims to help prepare physics students to understand, apply, and critically engage with the computational tools increasingly central to research, industry, and society.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07635v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Universal time-temperature scaling of conductivities in random site energy and associated random barrier model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07731</link><description>arXiv:2601.07731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal time-temperature scaling of conductivity spectra in disordered solids has been explained by thermally activated hopping of noninteracting particles over random energy barriers. An open problem is whether the random barrier model accounts for site energy disorder in real materials. Through mapping many-particle hopping in a disordered site energy landscape to that of independent particles in a barrier landscape, we show that time-temperature scaling is correctly described by the associated barrier model in the low temperature limit. However, the site energy model displays good scaling behavior at substantially higher temperatures than the barrier model, in agreement with experimental observations. Extending the mapping to different types of mobile charge carriers allows us to understand why time-temperature superposition can be absent in mixed alkali glasses.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07731v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Serial vs parallel recall in the Blume-Every-Griffiths neural networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07777</link><description>arXiv:2601.07777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully connected Blume-Emery-Griffiths neural networks performing pattern recognition and associative memory have been heuristically studied in the past (mainly via the replica trick and under the replica symmetric assumption) as generalization of the standard Hopfield reference. In these notes, at first, by relying upon Guerra interpolation, we re-obtain the existing picture rigorously. Next we show that, due to dilution in the patterns, these networks are able to switch from serial recall (where one pattern is retrieved per time) to parallel recall (where several patterns are retrieved at once) and the larger the dilution, the stronger this emerging multi-tasking capability. In particular, we inspect the regimes of mild dilution (where solely a low storage of pattern can be enabled) and extreme dilution (where a medium storage of patterns can be sustained) separately as they give rise to different outcomes: the former displays hierarchical recall (distributing the amplitudes of the retrieved signals with different amplitudes), the latter -instead- performs a equal-strength recall (where a O(1) fraction of all the patterns is simultaneously retrieved with the same amplitude per pattern). Finally, in order to implement graded responses in the neurons, variations on theme obtained by enlarging the possible values of neural activity these neurons may sustain are also discussed generalizing the Ghatak-Sherrington model for inverse freezing in Hebbian terms.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07777v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Ising Supercriticality and Universal Magnetocalorics in Spiral Antiferromagnet Nd$_3$BWO$_9$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07810</link><description>arXiv:2601.07810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated analogy between the pressure-temperature phase diagram of a liquid-gas system and the field-temperature phase diagram of an Ising ferromagnet has long been a cornerstone for understanding universality in critical phenomena. Here we extend this analogy to a highly frustrated antiferromagnet, the kagome-layered spiral Ising compound Nd$_3$BWO$_9$. In its field-temperature phase diagram, we identify a critical endpoint (CEP) and an associated Ising supercritical regime (ISR). The CEP of the metamagnetic transition is located at ${\mu_0H_c} \simeq 1.04$ T and $T_c \simeq 0.3$ K. Above this point, the ISR emerges with supercritical crossover lines that adhere to a universal scaling law, as evidenced by the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Remarkably, we observe a universally divergent Grueneisen ratio near the emergent CEP, $\Gamma_H \propto 1/t^{\beta+\gamma-1}$, with ${\beta} + {\gamma} \simeq 1.563$ the critical exponents of the 3D Ising universality class and $t \equiv (T - T_c)/T_c$ the reduced temperature. Our adiabatic demagnetization measurements on Nd$_3$BWO$_9$ reveal a lowest temperature of 195 mK achieved from 2 K and 4 T. Our work opens new avenues for studying supercritical physics and efficient cooling in layered-kagome, rare-earth RE$_3$BWO$_9$ family and, more broadly, in Ising-anisotropic magnets like spin ices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07810v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Energetic vs Inference-Based Invisibility: Fisher-Information Analysis of Two-Layer Acoustic Near-Cloaks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06091</link><description>arXiv:2601.06091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near-cloaks based on passive coatings can strongly suppress scattered-field energy in a narrow frequency band, yet an observer's ability to infer object parameters from noisy measurements need not decrease proportionally. We develop a fully theoretical two-dimensional (2D) framework for a coated acoustic cylinder in an air background. Using an exact cylindrical-harmonic solution of the Helmholtz equation, we compute the modal scattering coefficients a_m(omega) for a core of radius a surrounded by two concentric effective-fluid layers, and we design the coating to cancel the dominant low-order multipoles (monopole m=0 and dipole m=+/-1) at a target frequency, yielding a narrowband near-cloak. Beyond the conventional energetic metric (total scattering width), we quantify information-based detectability through the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and the associated Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for joint estimation of the size-material parameter vector x=[a, rho1, c1]^T from noisy far-field data. A representative air-background study exhibits an approximately 25 dB reduction in total scattering width near the design frequency, while tr(FIM) decreases by only a few dB, demonstrating that energy-based and inference-based notions of invisibility are distinct objectives. We further provide a low-order analytic argument clarifying the mechanism behind this energetic-informational decoupling and report design-space and local-robustness diagnostics that highlight persistent trade-offs between scattering suppression and parameter identifiability.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06091v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Imaginary Gauge-steerable Edge Modes In Non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06746</link><description>arXiv:2601.06746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper lattice exhibiting quasiperiodicity, featuring an imaginary gauge field that varies spatially but averages to zero. In the presence of open boundary conditions, this system is precisely mapped, through a nonunitary gauge transformation, to the Hermitian AAH model with balanced hopping terms. The mapping leaves the spectrum unchanged but reshapes each eigenfunction by a realization-dependent random-walk envelope. In a parameter regime where the Hermitian counterpart hosts spectrally isolated in-gap boundary modes, we identify two such modes with sharply different responses to the envelope: one stays anchored at the boundary, while the other is controllable via the gauge, allowing its peak intensity to be relocated solely by altering the gauge setup without modifying the associated eigenenergy. Additionally, we demonstrate that this steerable mode can be preferentially enhanced and generated from an initial bulk wavefunction by introducing mild site-specific amplification at a location determined exclusively from the Hermitian model using the biorthogonal function. These findings offer pathways for both static and dynamic manipulation of spatially adjustable in-gap states in quasiperiodic non-Hermitian lattices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06746v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] BEC with two ground-state filling rates for BCS Cooper-pairs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11447</link><description>arXiv:2311.11447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the effects on the thermodynamic properties of a 3D Bose gas caused by a temperature dependent energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state of the energy spectrum of the particles constituting the Bose gas which behaves like an ideal Bose gas when the gap is absent but whose properties are very different when it is present. Explicit formulae are given for the critical temperature, the condensate fraction, the internal energy and the isochoric specific heat, which are calculated for three different gaps which abruptly go to zero at a temperature $T_B$, as well as for the damped counterparts with a smoothed drop to zero. In particular, for the undamped BCS (Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer) gap it is observed that the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) critical temperature $T_c$ is equal to that of the ideal Bose gas $T_0$, for every $T_B \leq T_0$; surprisingly, the condensate fraction presents two different filling rates of the ground state, one at $T_c = T_0$ and another with a higher rate at $T_B &lt; T_0$, suggesting something like a {\it two-step} BEC; also, its specific heat shows a finite jump at $T_c$ and a divergence at $T_B$ with a critical exponent $\alpha=1/2$, which is inherited from the divergence of the temperature derivative of the BCS gap at $T_B$.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2311.11447v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Demonstrating Electrochemical CO$_2$ Capture on Redox-Active Metal-Organic Frameworks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16444</link><description>arXiv:2411.16444v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Addressing climate change calls for action to control CO$_2$ pollution. Direct air and ocean capture offer a solution to this challenge. Making carbon capture competitive with alternatives, such as forestation and mineralisation, requires fundamentally novel approaches and ideas. One such approach is electrosorption, which is currently limited by the availability of suitable electrosorbents. In this work, we introduce a metal-organic copper-2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene (Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$) metal-organic framework (MOF) that can act as electrosorbent for CO$_2$ capture, thereby expanding the palette of materials that can be used for this process. Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$ is the first MOF to switch its ability to capture and release CO$_2$ in aqueous electrolytes. By using cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) analysis, and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), we demonstrate reversible CO$_2$ electrosorption. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we provide atomistic insights into the mechanism of electrosorption and conclude that efficient CO$_2$ capture is facilitated by a combination of redox-active copper atom and aromatic HHTP ligand within Cu3(HHTP)2. By showcasing the applicability of Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$ -- with a CO$_2$ capacity of 2 mmol g$^{-1}$ and an adsorption enthalpy of -20 kJ mol$^{-1}$ - this study encourages further exploration of conductive redox-active MOFs in the search for superior CO$_2$ electrosorbents.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.16444v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Frustration-free free fermions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14312</link><description>arXiv:2503.14312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of frustration-free free-fermion systems and derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for such Hamiltonians. Assuming locality and translation invariance, we find that any band touching between the valence and the conduction bands is always quadratic or softer, which rules out the possibility of describing Dirac and Weyl semimetals using frustration-free local Hamiltonians. We further construct a frustration-free free-fermion model on the honeycomb lattice and show that its density fluctuations acquire an anomalous gap originating from the diverging quantum metric associated with the quadratic band-touching points. Nevertheless, an $O(1/L^2)$ finite-size scaling of the charge-neutral excitation gap can be verified even in the presence of interactions, consistent with the more general results we derive in an accompanying work [arXiv:2503.12879].</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.14312v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spin ladder quantum simulators from spin-orbit-coupled quantum dot spin qubits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08358</link><description>arXiv:2508.08358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent Ge hole spin qubit experiments, we construct and study a two-leg spin ladder from a quantum dot array with spin-orbit couplings (SOCs), aiming to uncover the many-body phase diagrams and provide concrete guidance for the Ge hole spin qubit experiments. The spin ladder is described by an unprecedented, complex spin Hamiltonian, which contains antiferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM), and anisotropic exchange interactions. We analyze the spin ladder Hamiltonian in two complementary situations, the strong rung coupling limit and the weak rung coupling limit. In the strong rung coupling limit, we systematically construct effective spin-1/2 chain models, connecting the well-studied one-dimensional spin models and providing a recipe for Hamiltonian engineering. It is worth emphasizing that effective DM interactions can be completely turned off while the microscopic DM interactions are generically inevitable. Moreover, the staggered DM interactions, which are not possible in the microscopic spin model, can also be realized in the effective spin-1/2 model. In the weak rung coupling limit, we employ Abelian bosonization and Luther-Emery fermionization, uncovering a multitude of phases. Several commensurate-incommensurate transitions are driven by both the longitudinal magnetic field and the DM interactions in the legs (chains). Remarkably, the low-energy phase diagrams show strong dependence in the DM interaction, providing a concrete way to identify the strength of SOC in the experiments. Our work bridges quantum many-body theory and spin qubit device physics, establishing spin ladders made of spin-orbit-coupled quantum dots as a promising platform for engineering exotic spin models, constructing quantum many-body states, and enabling programmable quantum computations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.08358v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Fermi sea topology and boundary geometry for free particles in one- and two-dimensional lattices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00590</link><description>arXiv:2509.00590v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Free gasses of spinless fermions moving on a lattice-symmetric geometric background are considered. Their topological properties at zero temperature can be used to classify their Fermi seas and associated boundaries. The flat orbifolds ${\Rb}^{d}/\Gamma$, where $\Gamma$ is the crystallographic group of symmetry in $d$-dimensional momentum space, are used to accomplish this task. Two topological classes exist for $d=1$: an interval, which is identified as a conductor, and a circumference, which corresponds to an insulator. The number of topological classes increases to 17 for $d=2$: 8 have the topology of a disk, that are generally recognized as conductors, and 4 correspond to a 2-sphere, matching insulators. Both sets eventually contain a finite number of conical singularities and reflection corners at the boundaries. The remaining cases in the listing relate to conductors (annulus, M\"obius strip) and insulators (2-torus, real projective plane, Klein bottle). Examples that fall under this list are given, along with physical interpretations of the singularities. It is anticipated that the findings of this classification will be robust under perturbative interactions due to its topological character.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.00590v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum Mechanics of an Abrikosov Vortex in Nanofabricated Pinning Potential</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12215</link><description>arXiv:2509.12215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A superconducting device is proposed for experimentally investigating whether an Abrikosov vortex can be modeled as a quantum mechanical quasiparticle. The design process of a type-II superconducting device capable of reliably pinning a single Abrikosov vortex is presented, creating a particle-in-a-box-like system. The proposed device consists of a cylindrically symmetric Nb film, 30 nm in diameter and 5 nm thick, with a 14 nm diameter artificial pinning center at its center. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations indicate robust single-vortex pinning under an applied field of 6 T. The presumed quantized energy levels and associated quantum wavefunctions of the vortex quasiparticle are obtained by numerically solving the two-dimensional time-independent Schr\"odinger equation for this system. It is shown that distinguishing the ground and first excited states is experimentally feasible. Beyond fundamental physics studies, the application of the proposed device in cryogenic memory technology and quantum computing warrant further exploration.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.12215v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum sensing of time-dependent magnetic signals with molecular spins</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17144</link><description>arXiv:2509.17144v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular spins offer a promising platform for quantum sensing, particularly in organic, supramolecular or biological environments. Recognition of the signals by these systems is of particular interest given their possible integration into more complex structures and their possible use as sensors in close proximity to analytes. In this work, we develop two quantum sensing protocols that enable discrimination between different time-dependent magnetic field, without requiring its periodicity to match with the microwave manipulating sequence. These are based on the Hahn echo sequence and have been tested on VO(TPP) and VOPt(SOCPh$)_{4}$ molecular spins embedded in a superconducting YBCO microwave planar resonator. We report a magnetic field sensitivity up to $2.57 \cdot 10^{-7} T Hz^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ (with lower bounds approaching $2.87 \cdot 10^{-8} T Hz^{-\frac{1}{2}})$ for signals with duration of a few microseconds. Under the given conditions, the minimum signal area that can be measured is in the $10^{-10}$ T s range, suggesting a potential trade-off between minimum measurable field and the required signal duration and memory time.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.17144v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Chirality reversal at finite magnetic impurity strength and local signatures of a topological phase transition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11707</link><description>arXiv:2510.11707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the honeycomb lattice with a single magnetic impurity modeled by adding imaginary next-nearest-neighbor hopping ih on a single hexagon. This Haldane defect gives a topological mass term to the gapless Dirac cones and generates chirality. For a small density of defects Neehus et al [arXiv:2405.19289] found that the system's chirality reverses at a critical hc ~ 0.95 associated with an unexpected tri-critical point of Dirac fermions at zero defect density. We investigate this zero-density limit by analyzing a single defect and computing two experimentally relevant measures of chirality: (1) orbital magnetization via local Chern marker, a bulk probe of all occupied states; and (2) electronic currents of low-energy states. Both probes show a chirality reversal at a critical hc ~ 0.9--1. Motivated by this consistency we propose a defect-scale toy model whose low energy states reverse their chirality at hc' ~ 0.87. Remarkably, the same pair of zero energy bound states also generate the critical point hc in the full impurity projected T-matrix. Our results show how the chirality reversal produced by an impurity can be observed either in local probes or in the global topology and suggest a possible role of the microscopic defect structure at the critical point.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.11707v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Effective-Hamiltonian reconstruction through Bloch-wave interferometry in bulk GaAs driven by strong THz fields</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26028</link><description>arXiv:2510.26028v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective Hamiltonians (EHs) are powerful tools for understanding the emergent phenomena in condensed matter. Reconstructing an EH directly from experimental data is challenging due to the intricate relationship between EH parameters and observables. Complementary to ARPES, which probes surface electronic properties, bulk-sensitive techniques based on HHG and HSG have shown strong potential for EH reconstruction (EHR). We reconstruct an effective three-band electron-hole (e-h) Hamiltonian in bulk GaAs based on HSG induced by quasi-cw NIR and THz lasers. We perform polarimetry of high-order sidebands while varying the wavelength and polarization of the NIR laser and the strength of the THz field, to systematically explore the information encoded in the sidebands. Based on previous understanding of HSG in GaAs in terms of Bloch-wave interferometry (BWI), an analytic model is derived to quantitatively connect the EH parameters with the measured sideband electric fields under strong, low-frequency THz fields. Assuming that the exciton reduced mass and the parameter that defines the hole Bloch wavefunctions in GaAs are known from existing experiments, we show that the GaAs bandgap, two dephasing constants associated with two e-h species, and an EH parameter that determines the e-h reduced masses, can be simultaneously and unambiguously determined through BWI. We demonstrate that full EHR can be achieved by combining HSG measurements with absorbance spectroscopy. We find that the extracted bandgap of GaAs is about 10\,meV higher than the value inferred from previous absorbance measurements. Quantum-kinetic analysis suggests that the e-h energy in HSG may be renormalized through Fr\"ohlich interaction that is modified by a strong THz field. We show that the energy threshold for optical-phonon emission can be suppressed by applying a strong THz field, leading to nearly constant dephasing rates.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.26028v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Symmetry and Topology in the Non-Hermitian Kitaev chain</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00951</link><description>arXiv:2601.00951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain with non-reciprocal hopping amplitudes and asymmetric superconducting pairing. We work out the symmetry structure of the model and show that particle-hole symmetry (PHS) is preserved throughout the entire parameter regime. As a consequence of PHS, the topological phase transition point of a finite open chain coincides with that of the periodic (infinite) system. By explicitly constructing the zero-energy wave functions (Majorana modes), we show that Majorana modes necessarily occur as reciprocal localization pairs accumulating on opposite boundaries, whose combined probability density exhibits an exact cancellation of the non-Hermitian skin effect for the zero energy modes. Excited states, by contrast, generically display skin-effect localization, with particle and hole components accumulating at opposite ends of the system. At the level of bulk topology, we further construct a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant in restricted parameter regimes that correctly distinguishes the topological and trivial phases. Finally, we present the topological phase diagram of the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain across a broad range of complex parameters and delineate the associated phase boundaries.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00951v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The Lee-Wick-Chern-Simons pseudo-quantum electrodynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15444</link><description>arXiv:2504.15444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lee-Wick pseudo-quantum electrodynamics in the presence of a Chern-Simons term is studied in this paper. The paper starts with a non-local lagrangian density that sets the pseudo-Lee-Wick electrodynamics defined on a $1+2$ space-time added to a non-local Chern-Simons topological term. Thus, we obtain the Lee-Wick-Chern-Simons pseudo-electrodynamics as a most complete gauge invariant model that provides a light mass associated with the Chern-Simons parameter, and also includes a Lee-Wick heavy mass. We investigate classical aspects as the potential energy for the interaction of static charges through the gauge propagator. The causality of theory is discussed through the retarded Green function in the coordinate space. The gauge field of the Lee-Wick-Chern-Simons pseudo-electrodynamics is minimally coupled to the fermions sector that includes new degree of freedoms, as a Lee-Wick heavy fermion partner of the electron. The perturbative approach for the theory is presented via effective action in which we obtain the Ward identities. We study the quantum corrections at one loop, as the electron self-energy, the vacuum polarization, and the $3$-vertex. We show that the Lee-Wick mass has a fundamental role in these results, where it works like a natural regulator of the ultraviolet divergences. The $g-2$ factor for the electron is obtained as function of the LW mass, and of the CS parameter. Through the optical theorem, the Lee-Wick-Chern-Simons pseudo-electrodynamics is unitary at the tree level.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.15444v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A Generalized Crystalline Equivalence Principle</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10978</link><description>arXiv:2508.10978v3 Announce Type: replace-cross

Abstract: The photophysics and photochemistry associated with irradiating UV light in liquid water is central to numerous physical, chemical and biological processes. One of the key events involved in this process is the generation of the hydrated electron. Despite long study from both experimental and theoretical fronts, a unified understanding of the underlying mechanisms associated with the generation of the solvated electron have remained elusive. Here, using excited-state molecular dynamics simulations of condensed phase photoexcited liquid water, we unravel the key sequence of chemical events leading to the creation of the hydrated electron on the excited state. The process begins through the excitation localized mostly on specific topological defects in the hydrogen-bond network of water which is subsequently followed by two main reaction pathways. The first, leads to the creation of a hydrogen atom culminating in non-radiative decay back to the ground-state within 100 femtoseconds. The second involves a proton coupled electron transfer, giving rise to the formation of the hydronium ion, hydroxyl radical and the hydrated excess electron on the excited-state. This process is facilitated by ultrafast coupled rotational and translational motions of water molecules leading to the formation of water mediated ion-radical pairs in the network. These species can survive on the picosecond timescale and ultimately modulate the emission of visible photons. All in all, our findings provide fresh perspectives into the interpretation of several independent time-dependent spectroscopies measured over the last decades, paving the way for new directions on both theoretical and experimental fronts.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.19702v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Enabling Long FFT Convolutions on Memory-Constrained FPGAs via Chunking</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06065</link><description>arXiv:2601.06065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The need for long-context reasoning has led to alternative neural network architectures besides Transformers and self-attention, a popular model being Hyena, which employs causal 1D-convolutions implemented with FFTs. Long convolutions enable efficient global context mixing, but requirements for intermediate results exceed the 2-3 MB Block RAM capacity of FPGAs. We present a chunked FFT convolution approach enabling 450K length sequence by 450K length filter convolutions on an Alveo U200 FPGA with 2.8 MB BRAM through chunking and overlap-add reconstruction. We find that throughput scales proportionally with chunk size while degrading minimally by 7% for our longest sequences, demonstrating that careful memory management enables deployment of long-context primitives on edge FPGAs without sacrificing performance.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06065v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Timing Fragility Aware Selective Hardening of RISCV Soft Processors on SRAM Based FPGAs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06308</link><description>arXiv:2601.06308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Selective hardening is widely employed to improve the reliability of FPGA based soft processors while limiting the overhead of full redundancy. However, existing approaches primarily rely on architectural criticality or functional fault analysis, overlooking the impact of routing dependent timing sensitivity on processor robustness. This paper introduces a timing fragility aware selective hardening methodology for RISCV soft processors implemented on SRAM based FPGAs. Building on recent advances in in situ timing observability, the proposed approach quantifies the statistical timing sensitivity of pipeline components under controlled routing perturbations and uses this information to guide hardening decisions. Experimental results on a RISCV processor implemented on a commercial FPGA platform show that components exhibiting higher timing fragility also demonstrate increased vulnerability to routing induced delay effects. Leveraging this correlation, the proposed selective hardening strategy achieves robustness comparable to full hardening while significantly reducing area and timing overhead. These results demonstrate that timing fragility provides a practical and effective metric for reliability aware design optimization in FPGA based processor architectures.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06308v1</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Quantum Chemical Insight into Electrochemical Upgrading of Bio-oil</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-02lvv?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Bio-oil derived from lignocellulosic biomass represents a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels as an energy source and chemical feedstock. Fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass yields a rich mixture of oxygenated organic species with low energy density and low stability, which can be electrochemically upgraded to increase energy density and stability and produce value-added chemicals. Here, we focus on electrocatalytic hydrotreatment of furfural (FF) and 4-propylphenol (4-PP), two constituents of raw bio-oil. In a binary mixture, the presence of FF has been shown to inhibit the reduction of 4-PP. The underlying mechanisms of these competing reactions are probed using density functional theory (DFT) and experimental electrochemical deposition techniques. The binding energies of FF and 4-PP, as well as their respective reduction products and associated reaction thermodynamics, are examined comparatively on multiple facets of single-crystal platinum and ruthenium catalysts. FF is shown to bind competitively compared to 4-PP, particularly on Pt(111) and Ru(0001), and hydrogenation products such as tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) and 4-propylcyclohexanol (4-PCOL) were found to bind less strongly to the surfaces than the reactants. FF reduction side products, including dimers furoin (FUI) and hydrofuroin (HF), were also found to bind competitively with 4-PP. No thermodynamic barriers were observed for FF hydrogenation to THFA, whereas 4-PCOL formation is favored on Pt facets, and propylcyclohexane (PC) formation is favored on Ru. The presence of barriers to 4-PP hydrogenation indicates that FF hydrogenation is thermodynamically favored on Pt and Ru. Further, limiting potential calculations suggests that the FF reduction pathways are generally favorable around 0 V vs. RHE. In contrast, the 4-PP reduction pathways require a more cathodic bias, achieved at potentials less than -0.1 V vs. RHE. Adsorption behavior of FF-derived reduction products on polycrystalline Pt is experimentally validated using a Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM). Such experiments yield estimates of aqueous-phase free energies of adsorption, which are correlated with the gas phase for comparison with computational results. Overall, the DFT model results suggest that the observed inhibition of 4-PP by FF is due to competitive adsorption and favorable FF reaction thermodynamics.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-02lvv?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Spectroscopy and dynamics of the v = 1 levels derived from the OH(D) stretching modes in the I‾∙HDO complex using CW and time-resolved, resonant two-photon infrared excitation of the cryogenically cooled ions</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-61x07?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The vibrational energy levels of the two isotopomers adopted by the I‾∙HDO ion-molecule complex occur such that the OH(D) stretching fundamentals span its dissociation energy, thus enabling a spectroscopic investigation of the dynamics displayed by a system prepared in the vicinity of the dissociation threshold. This regime is explored using infrared photoexcitation of the mass-selected complexes cooled in a cryogenic radiofrequency (Paul) ion trap. Survey spectra are obtained at modest resolution using two-color, IR-IR photodissociation with nanosecond lasers to establish the level structure and unimolecular decay dynamics of the v = 1 and 2 levels of the bound OH(D) oscillator. The v = 1 levels are prepared by fixed frequency excitation in the trap and the absorption spectra arising from this excited state are probed by photofragmentation of the complex with a second pulsed IR laser after a variable delay time (0 to 20 ms). The transitions to levels above the dissociation threshold for I‾ + HDO formation are observed to be sharp (~5 cm-1 FWHM). At low pressure, the bound OD (v = 1) population relaxes very slowly (3 ms), consistent with resonant fluorescence in the IR. The collisional quenching rate constants of this level by the He buffer gas were estimated to be on the order 3 x 10-12 cm3/sec based on a crude Stern-Volmer analysis. The rotational fine structure and linewidths (~&lt;0.01 cm-1 FWHM) arising from transitions of the non-bonded OH stretch fundamental of the OD-bound isotopomer that lies just above the dissociation energy are determined using single photon photodissociation by excitation of the 10 K ions with a single-frequency, CW IR laser in the ion trap.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-61x07?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

The challenge is compounded by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), a strain resistant to first-line antibiotics, which is associated with a 64% higher mortality rate compared to susceptible strains. Current methods for accurately identifying and localizing occult infections are limited, and there is a critical lack of effective novel treatments for infections that fail to respond to antibiotics. To address this, we pioneered the development of an antimicrobial peptide (AMP)-based radiotheranostic pair for the imaging-guided treatment of S. aureus and MRSA infections. We first screened a library of renowned AMPs for their efficacy against (MR)SA and their suitability for non-invasive, whole-body PET imaging after radiolabeling with Gallium-68. The optimal candidate, [68Ga]QAMP3, demonstrated excellent performance, readily and specifically accumulating in both S. aureus and MRSA infection sites, but not in sterile inflammation or tumors. A pilot first-in-human study confirmed the translatable diagnostic potential and favorable biosafety profile of [68Ga]QAMP3. Furthermore, the corresponding therapeutic agent, [177Lu]QAMP3, effectively reduced bacterial load in rat models of septic arthritis caused by both S. aureus and MRSA following a single systemic administration. Treatment resulted in the complete restoration of joint morphology, comparable to healthy controls. Simultaneously, [68Ga]QAMP3 PET/CT imaging accurately monitored the therapeutic response to both [177Lu]QAMP3 and conventional antibiotic treatment. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the stable α-helical conformation of QAMP3 likely confers superior membrane permeability and subsequent internalization into bacterial cells, leading to lethal DNA damage. These findings position [68Ga]/[177Lu]QAMP3 as an innovative theranostic pair for the rapid diagnosis and effective treatment of MRSA infections. This study also paves the way for developing new radio-antibiotics with mechanisms of action that can circumvent conventional antibiotic resistance.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-phkc6?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Enhanced Photodisplacement of Perylene Bisimides via Multi-Electron Extraction from CdSe Nanoplatelets</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-wk8lx?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Ligand exchange is an elegant route to tailor semiconducting nanocrystal surfaces, yet it is constrained by ground-state thermodynamics, and thus access is limited to the most stable interfacial structures. Light-driven ligand desorption, by contrast, offers a non-equilibrium handle to dynamically reconfigure surfaces and potentially reach thermodynamically inaccessible states. Here we study photoinduced displacement of perylene bisimide (PBI) ligands from 5-ML (monolayer) CdSe nanoplatelets (NPLs). Upon NPL excitation, the displacement efficiency is enhanced by up to 7 times compared with zero dimensional nanocrystals and can be tuned by NPL lateral dimensions and PBI surface loading. Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals 100-ps electron transfer from the NPL band edge to the PBI LUMO that initiates ligand dissociation. The overall yield is ultimately limited by the probability that a PBI ligand lies within the exciton diffusion range, set by vacant [100] basal-plane binding sites. These results establish nanoplatelets as efficient light-programmable platforms for dynamic ligand chemistry beyond thermodynamic control.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-wk8lx?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Visible-Light-Driven Ruthenium-Catalyzed Hydrogenation of Man-ganese-Nitride Complexes to Ammonia under Ambient Conditions</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-bdhgx?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>In recent years, photocatalytic hydrogenation of metal-nitrides to ammonia using solar energy as a renewable energy source and dihydrogen as both an electron and a proton source has been intensively investigated to achieve one of the most desirable next-generation scientific techniques, i.e., atom-economical ammonia production from dinitrogen and dihydrogen, thereby contributing to a carbon-neutral society. In this study, we have successfully developed visi-ble-light-driven photocatalytic hydrogenation of manganese-nitride complexes to ammonia at room temperature un-der 1 atm of dihydrogen in the presence of diruthenium complexes as dihydrogen oxidation catalysts and iridium complexes as photosensitizers. The turnover numbers based on the catalyst and the yield of ammonia based on the manganese-nitride complex reached up to 150 equiv. and 91%, respectively, indicating the high durability and effi-ciency of this photocatalytic system. Moreover, this hydrogenation proceeded photocatalytically even under 0.05 atm of dihydrogen, which was a much lower partial pressure compared to the previous systems reported by other re-search groups.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-bdhgx?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Rotation, Vibration, Torsion Coupling Effects in the Spectrum of Dimethyl Sulfide</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-74vrs?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The room temperature, high-resolution (8-16 MHz) rovibrational absorption spectrum of low-pressure dimethyl sulfide [Konnov et al., J. Chem. Phys. 2025, 37, 109690] shows spectral congestion at transition energies as low as  ~ 1000 cm-1 . The origin of this congestion is investigated theoretically by developing a rotation-torsion-vibration Hamiltonian and dipole moment surface that allow us to model the excitation of the methyl rocking vibrations that are excited in the experiment. The vibrations that are described by this  Hamiltonian include the two torsions and the seven  additional low-frequency vibrations with harmonic frequencies below 1100 cm-1.  The effect of Coriolis coupling is minimized by defining a body-fixed embedding that satisfies the Eckart condition at the nine equivalent minima on the potential surface. The couplings between the torsions and vibrations, especially for those states excited in  hot-band transitions, lead to substantial state mixing. Not only does this state mixing lead to spectral congestion due to intensity borrowing, it also leads to the quartet of transitions, which  are associated with the torsional tunneling of the two methyl groups, becoming spectrally distinct at the experimental resolution. These combined effects lead to model spectrum with similar levels of congestion as are observed experimentally, allowing us to deconvolute the various contributions to this low-energy spectral congestion.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-74vrs?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Despite being discovered over 40 years ago, TS-1 is seeing an increase in use in the chemical industry. The catalyst structure, especially the Ti speciation and local environment in the zeolitic framework as well as the nuclearity of the Ti sites in the pristine zeolite material are still debated. Here, we address this issue by applying high field (28.2 T) 47/49Ti NMR and 17O NMR spectroscopy, for an array of TS-1 catalysts. For extra-framework-free TS-1 catalysts the Ti sites are associated with a distinct NMR signature – δiso (49Ti) = -900 ppm; CQ,0(49Ti) = 7.2 MHz – which can be translated into structural parameters and a dominant first coordination environment according to an extended Czjzek model. With the implementation of a 47/49Ti NMR crystallography protocol, benchmarked on molecular models, this signature was assigned to the presence of mononuclear Ti framework sites in pristine TS-1 structures. The observed distribution of the NMR parameters presumably originates from variations of mononuclear Ti framework sites in the first and second coordination sphere, likely due to the occupancy of several T-sites.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-c765h-v3?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Polypharmacology Browser PPB3: A Web-based Deep Learning Tool for Target Prediction Using ChEMBL Data</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-rlgq5-v3?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Drug-like molecules often interact with multiple biological targets. Assessing this polypharmacology is essential for drug development. Here we trained deep neural networks to associate bioactive molecules up to 80 non-hydrogen atoms in size reported in ChEMBL 34, represented as binary substructure fingerprints, with lists of targets on which the molecules are 50% active at ≤10 µM. We included 2,496,555 interactions between 1,187,089 molecules and 7,546 targets having at least five reported active molecules, including single proteins, protein complexes, protein families, cell lines, organisms, and further target types. This represents a much larger dataset than previously reported models, which were mostly limited to protein targets. Our DNNs achieve good performance in terms of recall and precision per molecule and per target, as illustrated by overall statistics and by a case study in comparison with other online prediction tools.

We tested robustness of the umbrella trial strategy in this population by analyzing relationships between genomic status of a gene and associated downstream consequences at the protein level, which reveal poor relationships between mutations, copy number amplification, protein expression and activation. An in vivo compound repurposing screen using 11 clinically relevant agents from an NCI-portfolio with pan-RTK, non-RTK and/or PI3K-mTOR specificity identified dasatinib as most capable of restoring sensitivity to BRAFi/MEKi in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models originating from tumors that had progressed on BRAFi +/- MEKi.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00044-1?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[Joule] Toward water- and energy-sustainable lithium extraction from brines</title><link>https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00451-9?rss=yes</link><description>Lithium extraction from brines offers a promising pathway for future lithium supply, but its substantial water and energy demands hinder practical deployment and have received limited attention. This work quantitatively demonstrates that water-sustainable extraction is achievable by recovering freshwater during lithium concentration while also identifying the associated energy requirements and technical constraints. A solar-powered lithium-water cogeneration system is further proposed that integrates purification, concentration, and water recovery, enabling water- and energy-sustainable operation across the full extraction workflow.</description><author>Joule</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00451-9?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] LivePyxel: Accelerating image annotations with a Python-integrated webcam live streaming</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00421G</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, Accepted Manuscript&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00421G, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY-NC.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Uriel Garcilazo-Cruz, Joseph O.

In this study, full-lifecycle pulsed electrical aging tests were conducted on biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) films. Experimental results reveal that the blisters formed on the surface of electrically aged BOPP films are cavity-structured bubbles, which essentially represent a distinct form of “latent electrical weakness” arising from irreversible material degradation under multi-field electro–thermo–mechanical coupling. Furthermore, a physical model and equivalent impedance were established for these bubbles, providing additional evidence that the blisters play a decisive role in the degradation of the breakdown performance of BOPP films.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/2/022901/3377312/A-weakness-breakdown-model-of-a-BOPP-film-based-on</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] 214 MW/cm 2  vertical  β -Ga 2 O 3  UMOSFETs enabled by HF sidewall treatment</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/2/022107/3377311/214-MW-cm2-vertical-Ga2O3-UMOSFETs-enabled-by-HF</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Vertical &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;β&lt;/span&gt;-Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; U-shaped trench structures (UMOSFETs) incorporating current-blocking layers typically suffer from increased on-resistance, primarily caused by deep-level defect states in the trench sidewalls that trap free electrons. In this study, the hydrofluoric acid (HF) sidewall treatment was introduced prior to gate dielectric deposition to modify the trench surface. This process enables the effective incorporation of fluorine atoms into the sidewall region, increasing the electron concentration and mitigating the compensation associated with deep acceptor levels from heavy nitrogen implantation. As a result, the forward conduction is improved. In addition, the HF treatment partially passivates surface and interface traps and provides a mild polishing effect, which slightly reduces surface roughness. These changes help suppress interface scattering and further enhance carrier transport. The fabricated vertical &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;β&lt;/span&gt;-Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; UMOSFETs achieved a specific on-resistance of 6.0 mΩ cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a channel mobility of 19.1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/V s, and a breakdown voltage of 1132 V. These results demonstrate that HF sidewall treatment provides a simple and efficient surface engineering approach for significantly enhancing the conduction performance and overall electrical characteristics of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;β&lt;/span&gt;-Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; UMOSFETs.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/2/022107/3377311/214-MW-cm2-vertical-Ga2O3-UMOSFETs-enabled-by-HF</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Dissociating neural circuits of social and prosocial reward in rat helping behavior</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00069-6?rss=yes</link><description>Helping behavior in rodents provides a powerful model for studying neurobiological underpinnings of prosocial motivation. Previously, rats allowed to release a trapped conspecific demonstrated prosocial motivation selectively toward ingroup members. Here, a refined version of the Helping Behavior Test (HBT) allowed trapped rats to be freed without ensuing social contact, dissociating social from prosocial reward. In this “separated” HBT (SHBT), helping was not biased, as rats equally released ingroup and outgroup members.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00069-6?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Gut fungal landscape in colorectal cancer and its cross-kingdom interplay with gut microbial ecology</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00039-8?rss=yes</link><description>The gut microbiota is a key hallmark of colorectal cancer (CRC), yet gut fungi remain understudied. We characterized the gut fungal landscape and its associations with bacteria, metabolites, and trace elements in CRC using fecal samples from healthy controls (n = 401), colorectal polyp patients (n = 162), and CRC patients (n = 253). Fungal annotation was performed using genomic data from NCBI (PRJNA833221) as reference. Fungal diversity increased in CRC patients, with seven genera showing differential abundance.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid

Abstract: Amorphous elastomers exhibit significant rate-stiffening and unique viscous flow characteristics across a wide range of strain rates, often undergoing glass transition above a strain rate threshold. We have developed a thermodynamically-consistent and micromechanically-inspired constitutive model for soft elastomeric materials to capture the rate-dependent stress-strain behavior and hysteresis when subjected to low to high strain rates. Our proposed constitutive model encapsulates the viscous flow of materials through molecular motion at low strain rates and local rearrangement and alignment at high strain rates, essentially covering the glass transition. We applied our constitutive model to uniaxial compression experiments performed at low and high strain rates for polyborosiloxane (PBS) to identify the material parameters, and subsequently, performed numerical simulations of single and multi-cycle compression, stress relaxation, and small amplitude oscillatory tension-compression. Our analyses indicate that the model predicts higher total energy dissipation with increasing strain rate; however, dissipation associated with molecular relaxation decreases (forming a cusp) because, beyond a crossover strain rate, molecular rearrangement and alignment become dominant, which is consistent with the onset of the glass transition. For cyclic loading-unloading, we observed that dissipation over a cycle remains constant at low strain rate but decreases non-monotonically at high strain rates before becoming constant with peak stress over the cycle becoming higher, which can be interpreted as more loading being carried elastically by the polymer network as the molecular rearrangement process occurs. Additionally, our model was able to predict the qualitative nature of the storage modulus and loss modulus in the limit of small strain over a wide range of frequency sweeps.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05405v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Coupled Spin-lattice Dynamics across a Magnetostructural Phase Transition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05458</link><description>arXiv:2601.05458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-order magnetostructural phase transitions underpin giant magnetocaloric effects, yet the microscopic role of lattice dynamics in these transitions remains controversial. Here we use first-principles spin-lattice dynamics simulations to investigate the coupled evolution of magnetization and phonon dispersions across the magnetostructural transition in MnAs. Our simulations quantitatively reproduce the experimentally observed Curie temperature, lattice contraction, and free-energy crossing between hexagonal and orthorhombic phases. We show that below the Curie temperature, magnetic-field-induced hardening of soft phonon modes gives rise to a sizable lattice entropy contribution that enhances the total isothermal entropy change by approximately 23% under a 5 T field. In contrast, the lattice entropy change associated with the structural phase transition itself has an opposite sign and partially compensates the lattice contribution due to field-induced phonon hardening. This competition reconciles long-standing discrepancies in the interpretation of magnetocaloric entropy measurements across first-order transitions. In addition, we demonstrate that the strong magnetic-field dependence of the phonon spectrum near the transition enables large tunability of lattice thermal conductivity, highlighting MnAs as a promising platform for magnetic-field-controlled thermal switching. Our results establish a unified microscopic picture of spin-lattice coupling in first-order magnetocaloric materials and provide design principles for engineering enhanced caloric and thermal transport functionalities.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05458v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Molecular Orbital Degeneracy Lifting in a Tetrahedral Cluster System NbSeI</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05562</link><description>arXiv:2601.05562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lifting of degenerate electronic states, in which multiple electronic states share the same energy, is a fundamental issue in the physics of crystalline solids. In real materials, this problem has been extensively studied in transition metal compounds, where various quantum phenomena arise from the spin and orbital degeneracy of the d electrons on individual transition-metal atoms. In contrast, materials containing high-symmetry clusters composed of multiple transition-metal atoms are expected to exhibit more emergent phenomena due to the entanglement of the electronic degrees of freedom across multiple atoms. Here, we report the discovery of two distinct mechanisms of orbital-degeneracy lifting in NbSeI, which comprises Nb4 tetrahedral clusters with molecular orbital degrees of freedom and whose average crystal structure is predicted to host a flat-band metal. Below 106 K, NbSeI is found to be a nonmagnetic molecular orbital-ordered insulator. Above this temperature, the average structure becomes face-centered cubic without any superlattice, while the orbital degeneracy remains lifted by significant local distortions of Nb4 tetrahedra, which may be associated with a molecular orbital-liquid or orbital-frozen state. This noncooperative Jahn-Teller distortion stabilizes a nonmagnetic insulating state above 106 K, in stark contrast to the flat-band metal predicted from the average structure.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05562v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Transport characteristics in Hermitian and non-Hermitian Fibonacci rings: A comparative study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05743</link><description>arXiv:2601.05743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extensive theoretical analysis of transport and circular currents and the associated induced magnetic fields in Fibonacci rings, explored in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian descriptions, with particular attention to configurations preserving or breaking PT symmetry. By engineering physically balanced gain and loss following a Fibonacci sequence, we realize two distinct geometrical configurations in which the ring either preserve or explicitly break PT symmetry, and further explore complementary realizations obtained by reversing the signs of the on site potentials. Using the non equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism, we analyze transmission properties and bond current densities to quantify both transport and circulating currents. A comparison with the Hermitian limit establishes a clear baseline, where the ring supports only weak responses upon introducing disorder. In sharp contrast, non-Hermiticity leads to a pronounced amplification of transport and circular currents, and hence of the induced magnetic field. We further demonstrate that non-Hermitian transport is highly sensitive to gain and loss sign reversal and, in the non-PT-symmetric case, exhibits an unconventional dependence on system size governed by the parity of the Fibonacci sequence and hopping correlations. Remarkably, the current does not decay monotonically with increasing system size, revealing a distinct scaling behavior absent in conventional Hermitian systems. Our results highlight non-Hermitian quasiperiodic rings as versatile platforms for engineering and amplifying current driven magnetic responses through symmetry, topology, and gain-loss design.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05743v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Phase-space networks and connectivity of the kagome antiferromagnet</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05933</link><description>arXiv:2601.05933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the coplanar ground-state manifold of the kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet using a phase-space network representation, in which nodes correspond to coplanar ground states and edges represent transitions generated by weathervane loop rotations. In the coplanar manifold, each configuration can be mapped to a three-coloring problem on the dual honeycomb lattice, where a weathervane mode corresponds to a closed loop of two alternating colors. By comparing networks that include all weathervane loops with networks restricted to elementary six-spin loops, we examine how energetic constraints shape phase-space structure. We find that connectivity distributions are sharply peaked in large systems, while restrictions to short loops reduce typical connectivity. Spectral properties further distinguish the two cases, with short-loop networks exhibiting Gaussian spectra and full networks displaying non-Gaussian features associated with correlated loop updates. Finally, a box-counting analysis reveals distinct fractal properties of the two networks, demonstrating how energetic constraints control the global geometry of configuration space. These results show that the hierarchy of weathervane loop rotations provides a direct link between microscopic constraints and emergent phase-space geometry in a frustrated magnet.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05933v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Modeling phononic band gap in microstructured solids using the Riemann-Cartan geometric framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05402</link><description>arXiv:2601.05402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling acoustic wave fields in microstructured elastic solids is discussed in the context of the Riemann-Cartan geometry. We consider a scenario where microstructural deformations occur much faster than those of the bulk material. This time-scale separation creates apparent geometric incompatibilities at the macroscopic level, even without any permanent inelastic deformation (at micro or macro-scale) or damage. We formalize this phenomenon using the concept of a non-holonomic tetrads to represent the macroscopic elastic deformations and the associated torsion field to characterize the resulting geometric incompatibilities. The spatial components of the torsion tensor quantify the instantaneous geometric incompatibility of the macroscopic elastic deformations, while its time components capture the inertial effects arising from the reversible energy exchange between the micro and macro scales. A key finding is that the model's dispersion relation predicts the existence of a complete frequency band gap. Furthermore, the governing equations exhibit a notable mathematical analogy to Maxwell's equations which can link the modeling of phononic and photonic metamaterials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05402v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Magnetodynamics of short nanoparticle chains</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01561</link><description>arXiv:2408.01561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the understanding and application of nanoparticle assemblies driven by external fields. Although these systems can exhibit marked transitions in behavior compared to non-interacting counterparts, it has often proven challenging to connect their dynamics with underlying physical mechanisms or even to verifiably establish their structure under realistic experimental conditions. We have studied colloidal iron oxide nanoparticles that assemble into ordered, few-particle linear chains under the influence of oscillating and pulsed magnetic fields. In this work, our goal has been to answer the following question: by what physical mechanisms does the magnetic switching of a linear chain evolve from the switching of its constituent particles? Cryo-TEM has been used to flash freeze and image the structures formed by oscillatory drive fields, and magnetic relaxometry has been used to extract the multiple time constants associated with magnetic switching of the short chains. Armed with the physical structure from microscopy and the field-dependent switching times from magnetic measurements, we have conducted extensive micromagnetic simulations, revealing probable physical mechanisms for each time constant regime spanning ~1 microsecond to 1 s in time. These types of magnetic nanomaterials have great potential for biomedical technologies, particularly magnetic particle imaging and hyperthermia, and rigorous elucidation of their physics will hasten their optimization.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2408.01561v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Efficient Band Structure Unfolding with Atom-centered Orbitals: General Theory and Application</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21089</link><description>arXiv:2506.21089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Band structure unfolding is a key technique for analyzing and simplifying the electronic band structure of large, internally distorted supercells that break the primitive cell's translational symmetry. In this work, we present an efficient band unfolding method for atomic orbital (AO) basis sets that explicitly accounts for both the non-orthogonality of atomic orbitals and their atom-centered nature. Unlike existing approaches that typically rely on a plane-wave representation of the (semi-)valence states, we here derive analytical expressions that recasts the primitive cell translational operator and the associated Bloch-functions in the supercell AO basis. In turn, this enables the accurate and efficient unfolding of conduction, valence, and core states in all-electron codes, as demonstrated by our implementation in the all-electron ab initio simulation package FHI-aims, which employs numeric atom-centered orbitals. We explicitly demonstrate the capability of running large-scale unfolding calculations for systems with thousands of atoms and showcase the importance of this technique for computing temperature-dependent spectral functions in strongly anharmonic materials using CuI as example.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.21089v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Temperature dependence of $p$-wave contacts in a harmonically trapped Fermi gas</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04738</link><description>arXiv:2509.04738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dependence of the $p$-wave contact on the Fermi temperature $T_F$ and reduced temperature $T/T_F$ based on the number of closed-channel molecules. From the anisotropic pattern of dissociated molecules, we resolve the narrow $m=0$ and $m=\pm1$ dipolar splitting of the $p$-wave Feshbach resonance in $^6$Li, enabling the independent determination of the contact for all three $m$ components. For each component, we identify a near-resonant scaling with $\sqrt{T_F}$, indicating the contribution of the normalized effective range $k_F R_{\rm{e}}$. In addition, we show that the peak contacts observed near resonance increase as $T/T_F$ is lowered, a trend that is accurately captured by estimates based on the second-order virial expansion. Our results, together with estimates from the $p$-wave virial expansion, provide a route toward a complete understanding of the thermodynamics of resonantly enhanced $p$-wave Fermi gases.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.04738v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Building cluster systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19868</link><description>arXiv:2509.19868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical spin liquids are frustrated magnetic phases characterized by local constraints, flat bands in reciprocal space, and emergent gauge structures with distinctive signatures such as pinch points. These arise generally in \emph{cluster systems}, where spin interactions can be expressed as constraints on clusters of spins. In this work we present the different generic rules allowing to build such cluster systems together with a few tools allowing to quickly characterize it. We show that based on these rules, it is possible to conceive a tunable recipe for generating such models by decorating a parent lattice on its bonds and/or vertices with symmetry-compatible clusters. This approach highlights a key design trade-off: using fewer cluster types increases the number of flat bands and enhances spin-liquid behavior, but produces denser connectivity that is harder to realize experimentally. The framework is highly tunable, extends naturally to two and three dimensions, and provides a versatile toolbox for engineering new classical spin-liquid candidates with targeted features such as higher-rank pinch points or pinch lines. Among the catalog of cluster systems generated following the decoration scheme, a common feature appears to be the existence of additional flat bands in the spectrum, which motivates a detailed study of the origin of these flat bands and their associated physics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.19868v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Disordered Dynamics in High Dimensions: Connections to Random Matrices and Machine Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01010</link><description>arXiv:2601.01010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an overview of high dimensional dynamical systems driven by random matrices, focusing on applications to simple models of learning and generalization in machine learning theory. Using both cavity method arguments and path integrals, we review how the behavior of a coupled infinite dimensional system can be characterized as a stochastic process for each single site of the system. We provide a pedagogical treatment of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), a framework that can be flexibly applied to these settings. The DMFT single site stochastic process is fully characterized by a set of (two-time) correlation and response functions. For linear time-invariant systems, we illustrate connections between random matrix resolvents and the DMFT response. We demonstrate applications of these ideas to machine learning models such as gradient flow, stochastic gradient descent on random feature models and deep linear networks in the feature learning regime trained on random data. We demonstrate how bias and variance decompositions (analysis of ensembling/bagging etc) can be computed by averaging over subsets of the DMFT noise variables. From our formalism we also investigate how linear systems driven with random non-Hermitian matrices (such as random feature models) can exhibit non-monotonic loss curves with training time, while Hermitian matrices with the matching spectra do not, highlighting a different mechanism for non-monotonicity than small eigenvalues causing instability to label noise. Lastly, we provide asymptotic descriptions of the training and test loss dynamics for randomly initialized deep linear neural networks trained in the feature learning regime with high-dimensional random data. In this case, the time translation invariance structure is lost and the hidden layer weights are characterized as spiked random matrices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01010v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Non-Hermitian topological superfluidity in a three-dimensional fermi gas with spin-orbit coupling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01790</link><description>arXiv:2601.01790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The experimental advances in realizing artificial spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and non-Hermitian potentials in ultracold atomic system open a new avenue for exploring their significant roles in quantum many-body physics. Here, we investigate a non-Hermitian, two-component Fermi system in a cubic lattice with Rashba SOC and complex-valued interaction arising from two-body loss. We adopt the non-Hermitian mean field theory and map out the phase diagram at zero temperature. The interplay of dissipation and on-site interaction drives a dissipation-induced phase transition from superfluid (SF) to normal phase (N). Notably, for weak interaction strengths, this leads to a reentrance of the superfluid state. The presence of SOC significantly expands the parameter regime for both the normal phase and the metastable superfluid phase(MSF). Whereas, the Zeeman field can drive the system from a conventional superfluid into a topological superfluid phase(TSF), characterized by a nontrivial topological invariant. These results enrich our knowledge of pairing superfluidity in Fermi systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01790v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Multiscale Experimental Evidence of a Transitory State in the HDA-LDA Transition in Alumino-sodo-silicate Glasses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03021</link><description>arXiv:2601.03021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The structural evolution with temperature of pure silica (SiO2), sodium-silicate (5Na2O-95SiO2, 10Na2O-90SiO2 and 25Na2O-75SiO2) and albite (15Na2O-15Al2O3-75SiO2) glasses previously densified from hot compression is monitored with a combination of small and wide angle x-ray scattering. Transient scattering maxima in the length scales associated with both techniques indicate the presence of a transitory state, suggesting the classification of the initial and final states as distinct glass states in the context of polyamorphism. In all glasses, a transient intensity peak in the small angle scattering is observed, consistent with the nucleation of a new amorphous state. Based on a comparison with the phenomenology observed in supercooled and glassy water, we propose that this structural evolution provide a strong evidence of the glass polyamorphism as the consequence of the existence of an underlying but thermodynamically defined liquid-liquid transition, independent on the polymerization degree of the system.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03021v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Solving Inverse Problems in Stochastic Self-Organizing Systems through Invariant Representations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11796</link><description>arXiv:2506.11796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-organizing systems demonstrate how simple local rules can generate complex stochastic patterns. Many natural systems rely on such dynamics, making self-organization central to understanding natural complexity. A fundamental challenge in modeling such systems is solving the inverse problem: finding the unknown causal parameters from macroscopic observations. This task becomes particularly difficult when observations have a strong stochastic component, yielding diverse yet equivalent patterns. Traditional inverse methods fail in this setting, as pixel-wise metrics cannot capture feature similarities between variable outcomes. In this work, we introduce a novel inverse modeling method specifically designed to handle stochasticity in the observable space, leveraging the capacity of visual embeddings to produce robust representations that capture perceptual invariances. By mapping the pattern representations onto an invariant embedding space, we can effectively recover unknown causal parameters without the need for handcrafted objective functions or heuristics. We evaluate the method on three self-organizing systems: a physical, a biological, and a social one; namely, a reaction-diffusion system, a model of embryonic development, and an agent-based model of social segregation. We show that the method reliably recovers parameters despite stochasticity in the pattern outcomes. We further apply the method to real biological patterns, highlighting its potential as a tool for both theorists and experimentalists to investigate the dynamics underlying complex stochastic pattern formation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.11796v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] What is emergence, after all?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04951</link><description>arXiv:2507.04951v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The term emergence is increasingly used across scientific disciplines to describe phenomena that arise from interactions among a system's components but cannot be readily inferred by examining those components in isolation. While often invoked to explain higher-level behaviors, such as flocking, synchronization, or collective intelligence, the term is frequently used without precision, sometimes giving rise to ambiguity or even mystique. In this perspective paper, we clarify the scientific meaning of emergence as a measurable and physically grounded phenomenon. Through concrete examples, such as temperature, magnetism, and herd immunity in social networks, we review how collective behavior can arise from local interactions that are constrained by global boundaries. By refining the concept of emergence, we gain a clearer and more grounded understanding of complex systems. Our goal is to show that emergence, when properly framed, offers not mysticism but insight.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.04951v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Generalized Wigner theorem for non-invertible symmetries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25327</link><description>arXiv:2509.25327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the conditions under which a conservation law associated with a non-invertible operator may be realized as a symmetry in quantum mechanics. As established by Wigner, all quantum symmetries must be represented by either unitary or antiunitary transformations. Relinquishing an implicit assumption of invertibility, we demonstrate that the fundamental invariance of quantum transition probabilities under the application of symmetries mandates that all non-invertible symmetries may only correspond to {\it projective} unitary or antiunitary transformations, i.e., {\it partial isometries}. This extends the notion of physical states beyond conventional rays in Hilbert space to equivalence classes in an {\it extended, gauged Hilbert space}, thereby broadening the traditional understanding of symmetry transformations in quantum theory. We discuss consequences of this result and explicitly illustrate how, in simple model systems, whether symmetries be invertible or non-invertible may be inextricably related to the particular boundary conditions that are being used.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.25327v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] LACIN: Linearly Arranged Complete Interconnection Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05668</link><description>arXiv:2601.05668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several interconnection networks are based on the complete graph topology. Networks with a moderate size can be based on a single complete graph. However, large-scale networks such as Dragonfly and HyperX use, respectively, a hierarchical or a multi-dimensional composition of complete graphs.
  The number of links in these networks is huge and grows rapidly with their size. This paper introduces LACIN, a set of complete graph implementations that use identically indexed ports to link switches. This way of implementing the network reduces the complexity of its cabling and its routing. LACIN eases the deployment of networks for parallel computers of different scales, from VLSI systems to the largest supercomputers.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05668v1</guid></item><item><title>[Nature] AIs are biased toward some Indian castes — how can researchers fix this?</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-04041-0</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature, Published online: 12 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-04041-0"&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-025-04041-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Benchmarks reveal how artificial-intelligence systems reinforce discriminatory social hierarchies.</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-04041-0</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Quaternary biopesticides and disinfectants derived from quinine and amino acids – environmental prospects and risks</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-h5hbb-v3?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The numerous risks associated with the toxicity of conventional quaternary ammonium salts (QASs) to various groups of living organisms have prompted the search for new, safer biologically active compounds synthesized in a sustainable manner from renewable raw materials. Here, we describe new QASs of natural origin containing quinine-based cation and anions derived from proteinogenic amino acids – L-asparagine and L-alanine. The quinine-derived QASs were thoroughly characterized in terms of correctness of chemical structure, physicochemical properties, and biological activity. It was discovered that due to quinine activity, the new salts exhibit strong antifeedant activity toward stored products pests, and in the case of elongation of the alkyl substituent in the 1-alkylquininium cation, they also become potent disinfectants. The performed analyses also allowed to assess the environmental risk by determining toxicity to monocotyledonous (Sorghum bicolor) and dicotyledonous (Sinapis alba) terrestial plants, freshwater algae (Chlorella vulgaris) and crustaceans (Daphnia magna) at various concentrations of the test substance. None of the QASs of natural origin showed phytotoxicity, and salts containing short alkyl substituents in quinine-based cations were noticeably less toxic to aquatic organisms than the other tested compounds. The results indicate that although a trade-off between antimicrobial activity and aquatic toxicity must be made when designing new quinine-based antiseptics, it is possible to obtain potent, naturally-derived and relatively low-toxic biopesticides based on quinine and amino acids.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-h5hbb-v3?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] A Reversible ATR-FTIR Biosensor with Single Residue Sensitivity</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-8875c?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Infrared spectroscopy provides label-free access to protein structure information with high sensitivity. Challenges in infrared spectroscopy include artifacts arising from temperature changes, baseline drifts and the strong water absorption, especially in difference spectroscopy, where signals are orders of magnitude smaller than the total absorbance. Previously, we introduced an ATR-based immuno-infrared sensor (iRS) based on sophisticated surface chemistry. This provides a stable platform for covalent protein immobilization and allows its application with body fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid or blood without unspecific background. It detects misfolding of small amounts of antigen (Abeta or alpha-synuclein) by binding to an antibody or antibody fragment, which allows for the diagnosis of various neurodegenerative diseases.  Here, we extend this platform by introducing reversible binding via the NColE7/Im7 pair. Im7-tagged proteins are captured with sub-picomolar affinity and quantitatively released under mild conditions (high salt or low pH), allowing repeated capture-regeneration cycles with continuous spectral monitoring of the Im7 fusion protein. Using an Im7-antibody Fab fusion protein, we present a reusable immune-IR sensor that enables multiple measurements on the same surface. For example, different antibodies can be used for differential screening. Using alternating Im7 protein attachments to the internal reflection element, we further compare Im7 single point mutants to wild-type Im7 to resolve infrared signatures of specific amino acid substitutions. Difference spectra reveal the distinct tyrosine absorption associated with either the introduction or removal of a single tyrosine residue, providing the first proof-of-concept for difference spectroscopy with single-residue sensitivity based on complete protein exchange.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-8875c?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Eyring's Rate Theory and Its Connection to Entropy Scaling: Viscosity and Self-Diffusion of Hydrocarbons, Alcohols, and Water</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-nbhbq-v3?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Eyring's absolute rate theory relates fluid flow with the activation energy necessary for a molecule to go from one equilibrium position to another. Developed nearly a century ago, it remains a powerful approach for understanding transport processes in liquids. This work presents a revision of Eyring's theory by replacing the vaporization-based parts of the theory with a residual approach that conceptualizes transport as local (re)movement of molecules within the system rather than removal from it. In this new approach, the energy barrier corresponds to the difference between a molecule with and without intermolecular interactions, effectively treating it as the residual property related to an ideal gas reference state. Furthermore, we explore the physical connections between Eyring's absolute rate theory and Rosenfeld excess entropy scaling, revealing that both approaches describe complementary aspects of the same transport phenomena. It is tempting to link both theories. The activation parameters in Eyring's theory, particularly the energy of activation, are shown to relate to the residual entropy used in entropy scaling. This provides a pathway to establish entropy scaling on a more rigorous physical foundation while offering deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms governing viscous flow. In comparison to experimental data, the revised theory demonstrated significant predictive power for viscosity across a wide range of thermodynamic conditions and species, including associating liquids. Moreover, parameters are transferable to other properties, such as self-diffusion.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-nbhbq-v3?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

In non–small cell lung cancer, immune checkpoint inhibitors have improved outcomes, and senescence programs can influence antigen presentation, immune cell recruitment, and adaptive resistance. This Review integrates evidence from cell and animal models, patient-derived datasets, and early clinical studies to map senescent cell states across cancer immunoediting and treatment contexts.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00048-9?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[Nature] Same-sex sexual behaviour can help primates to survive — and reproduce</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00119-5</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature, Published online: 12 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00119-5"&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-026-00119-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Bonds between same-sex individuals help apes and monkeys to manage conflict and strengthen alliances, especially in dry habitats and predator-rich landscapes.</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00119-5</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Cultural diversity of religion across 117 countries</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67671-y</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 12 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67671-y"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-025-67671-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Societies differ widely in cultural values across the world.

The inherently weak spin–orbit coupling (SOC) in organic materials makes them ideal candidates for spin transport. However, the strong electron–phonon (e-p) coupling and hyperfine interactions would decrease the carrier mobility. In addition, complex phenomena such as singlet-triplet conversion, carrier recombination, and the existence of impurities and defects contribute to complex spin relaxation mechanisms. This review provides an overview of spin injection and transport processes in organic materials, with an emphasis on their spin-dependent optical responses. Common methods of light-controlled spin manipulation are reviewed, along with the interaction between photons and spins. Ultrafast optical techniques for spin control are also briefly discussed. This work aims to deepen our understanding of photon-spin coupling in organic systems and provide insights that may contribute to the advancement of organic opto-spintronics.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/13/1/011308/3377206/Manipulating-spins-in-organic-and-chiral-systems</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Inhalable Platelet Membrane-Camouflaged Matrine Biomimetic Nanoparticles for Efficient Acute Lung Injury Therapy</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00058-1?rss=yes</link><description>Sepsis frequently progresses to acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which are associated with high mortality. Current treatments face limitations due to resistance and toxicity. Matrine, a component of traditional Chinese medicine, exhibits anti-inflammatory properties but suffers from poor selectivity and potential toxicity. To address these challenges, this study developed platelet membrane-coated matrine nanoparticles (PM@Mat-NPs) for targeted ALI treatment.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00058-1?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] ERG Phase Separation Attenuates Cellular Senescence</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00053-2?rss=yes</link><description>Centenarians, individuals who reach extreme old age, provide a valuable model for understanding mechanisms associated with healthy aging. Using ATAC-seq and transcriptomic profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from centenarians, we identified a distinct chromatin accessibility landscape linked to exceptional longevity. Integrative analysis highlighted the ETS-related transcription factor ERG as a longevity-associated regulator. Functional studies in human cells showed that ERG forms nuclear condensates through liquid–liquid phase separation, a property associated with altered chromatin organization and reduced expression of senescence-related genes, including CDKN2A.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid

Yet, mechanical activation of ferrocene or its irradiation when heavily distorted by strain leads to Fe–cyclopentadienyl bond scission. However, a direct link between simultaneous mechanical force transduction and photoactivation has never been established. Here, we show that light can harness stored mechanical energy to induce the metal–ligand bond dissociation. A family of ferrocene–cycloparaphenylene nanohoops (Fc[n]CPP, n = 6–8) releases Fe²⁺ efficiently under visible light, even when the ferrocene unit itself is unstrained. X-ray crystal structure analysis, quantum yield measurements, and excited-state calculations reveal that reactivity scales with strain localized in the aromatic hoop-like ligand, not with distortion at the metal center. This correlation identifies the hoop as an internal stress reservoir that lowers the triplet-state barrier for Fe–cyclopentadienyl cleavage. By coupling mechanical bias to photochemical reactivity, this work establishes a concept of photomechanophores, molecular units in which light and mechanical activation operate in concert. Thereby, we lay foundation of a general framework for designing tunable photocages and new force-responsive materials that can be modulated by light.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-7g2pt?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Driving Forces of Amyloid Protofibril Stability</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-skt9d?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Amyloid protofibrils are highly ordered protein assemblies characterized by a high content of β-sheets and are implicated in a wide range of pathological conditions. Amyloid crystals represent a distinct polymorphic form of amyloid assemblies that arise from the progressive untwisting and lateral association of twisted ribbon fibrils and correspond to the ground state of the protein folding and aggregation energy landscape. However, the driving forces underlying these processes remain difficult to quantify at the molecular level and from a quantum-chemical perspective. Here, we present a computational framework that combines molecular dynamics simulations, the Jarzynski estimator, and symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) to evaluate the potential of mean force associated with peptide transfer either from a soluble state to a crystalline protofibril or from the protofibril into the surrounding microenvironment. We apply this approach to the NNQQ peptide, which has been shown by X-ray microcrystallography to form amyloid fibrils composed of parallel β-strands in the presence of alkali halide salts (Nature 447, 453–457 (2007)). Structural stability increases from Na+ to K+, driven by enhanced ion-peptide electrostatic interactions as revealed by SAPT analysis. Furthermore, quantum-chemical analysis reveals a clear polarity-dependence in the dominant stabilizing forces of amyloid protofibrils. The highly polar NNQQ polymorphs are stabilized mainly by induction (charge transfer and polarization) and dispersion interactions, whereas the highly apolar MVGGVV polymorphs from the amyloid-β sequence are determined predominantly by electrostatic and dispersion contributions. Together, this multidimensional framework establishes a quantitative, molecular-level foundation for understanding amyloid stability and its modulation by environmental conditions and protein identity. More broadly, it provides a general and transferable strategy for assessing amyloid stability and for rationally designing inhibitors that disrupt amyloid assemblies.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-skt9d?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Communications Physics] Smile-shaped electron gradient distributions observed during magnetic reconnection at Earth’s magnetopause</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-026-02489-8</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Communications Physics, Published online: 10 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-026-02489-8"&gt;doi:10.1038/s42005-026-02489-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Electron distributions exhibit velocity-space signatures indicative of the rapid energy released by magnetic reconnection explosions occurring in Earth’s magnetosphere and in plasmas throughout the universe.

In most previous cross-metathesis approaches, acrylonitrile has been employed as the CM partner olefin. While internal olefins such as cis-2-butene-1,4-diol have been explored in metathesis reactions, their use without protecting groups has remained challenging. In this study, the unprotected diol enables direct access to highly functionalized intermediates, avoids dimer formation associated with terminal olefins, and allows subsequent isomerization in a single step. Efficient CM was acheived at low temperature (0 °C) using a Stewart-Grubbs catalyst, affording CM product 4 in excellent yield. Compound 4 was readily converted to alcohol 10, aldehyde 13, and olefin 9 in a single step and in &gt;90% yields. These intermediates are useful precursors for specialty chemicals, including 11-aminoundecanoate, the precursor of PA11. A tandem CM/isomerization process from 4 to 13 was also demonstrated for the first time.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2022-5c8x9-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Analytical solution of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04296</link><description>arXiv:2601.04296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a pedagogical derivation of the thermodynamics of a van der Waals fluid by explicitly incorporating pairwise molecular interactions and the finite size of particles into the statistical-mechanical description. Starting from the Lennard-Jones potential, we evaluate the second virial coefficient to infer the virial expansion of the equation of state and recover the van der Waals equation using only its leading correction. The corresponding partition function allows us to obtain all thermodynamic potentials for both monoatomic and diatomic fluids in a transparent and instructive manner.
  Building on this framework, we formulate and solve analytically the Clausius-Clapeyron equation in the vicinity of the critical point, obtaining the liquid-vapor coexistence curve in closed form. This approach not only clarifies the microscopic origin of van der Waals thermodynamics but also complements-and in several aspects improves upon-traditional treatments that rely heavily on numerical methods or heuristic arguments.
  In addition, because the van der Waals equation naturally predicts the liquid-vapor equilibrium, the existence of critical points, and the functional form of the saturation curve of the pressure as a function of temperature, it provides an analytically tractable framework for studying a 150-year-old problem that has historically been addressed using graphical constructions or numerical solutions. As such, the formulation developed here offers a coherent, accessible, and conceptually unified route for students and instructors to understand phase coexistence in simple fluids from first principles.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04296v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Fast Phase Logic Family for Achieving Very Large Scale Integration in Superconductor Electronics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04363</link><description>arXiv:2601.04363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Phase Logic (FPL) is a novel digital superconductor electronic (SCE) logic family specifically designed to address critical challenges in state-of-the-art SCE, such as low device density and integration levels. The FPL family improves circuit performance by employing various Josephson junction (JJ) structures, including high-$J_c$ self-shunted 0-JJ stacks, $\pi$-JJs, and 0/$\pi$-JJ stacks. FPL utilizes 0- and $\pi$-JJs to replace the bulky geometric inductors required in single flux quantum (SFQ) logic families like RSFQ. The proposed FPL family can deliver up to two orders of magnitude improvement in integration density over RSFQ logic with a five-fold reduction in the bias current requirements. Circuit performance is enhanced with reduced latency and increased throughput. Furthermore, the FPL family provides a higher output voltage level and higher impedance, which better match those of CMOS circuits. The much smaller flux storage loops in FPL greatly reduce susceptibility to trapped flux and crosstalk. Advancements in fabrication processes that would further benefit FPL implementation include the use of NbTiN-based JJs with higher critical current density and fabrication temperature range up to 400~$^\circ$C, or the use of stacked JJ structures. The resulting increased density makes very large-scale integration (VLSI) more practical. The FPL family has the potential to significantly advance SCE technology. Near-term applications are envisioned in accelerator cores for signal processing and artificial intelligence, with long-term potential in supercomputing applications. The advantages of FPL were demonstrated through an architectural study of a fast Fourier transform (FFT) circuit, comparing it with CMOS and SFQ technologies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04363v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Oxygen in diamond: thermal stability of ST1 spin centres and creation of oxygen-pair complexes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04418</link><description>arXiv:2601.04418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Little is known about oxygen-related defects in diamond. Recently, the promising room-temperature spin centre named ST1 was identified as an oxygen centre, but of still unknown atomic structure and thermal stability. In this work, we report on the optically active oxygen-related centres and the conditions for their formation, using ion implantation of oxygen in various conditions of depth and fluence. More specifically, we establish the temperature formation/stability range of the ST1 centre, which has a maximum at about 1100{\deg}C and is narrower than for NV centres. In these conditions, optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) on small ST1 ensembles was measured with a spin readout contrast of &gt; 20% at 300K. In cathodoluminescence, the 535 nm ST1 peak is not observed. Besides, a broad peak centred at 460 nm is measured for implantation of O$_2$ molecular ions. For an annealing temperature of 1500{\deg}C, a different centre is formed (with ZPL at 584.5 nm) with an intensity increasing with a power law 1.5 &lt; p &lt; 1.9 dependence from the implantation fluence. This suggests that this centre contains two oxygen atoms. Besides, a new spectral feature associated to an intrinsic defect was also observed, with four prominent lines (especially at 594nm). Finally, the thermal formation and stability of oxygen centres in diamond presented here are important for the identification of the atomic structure of defects such as the ST1 and possible O$_2$V$_x$ complex by means of ab initio calculations. Indeed, the formation energies and charge states of defect centres are easier to compute than the full energy level scheme, which to date still remains unsuccessful regarding the ST1 centre.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04418v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] SpectraFormer: an Attention-Based Raman Unmixing Tool for Accessing the Graphene Buffer-Layer Signature on SiC</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04445</link><description>arXiv:2601.04445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Raman spectroscopy is a key tool for graphene characterization, yet its application to graphene grown on silicon carbide (SiC) is strongly limited by the intense and variable second-order Raman response of the substrate. This limitation is critical for buffer layer graphene, a semiconducting interfacial phase, whose vibrational signatures are overlapped with the SiC background and challenging to be reliably accessed using conventional reference-based subtraction, due to strong spatial and experimental variability of the substrate signal. Here we present SpectraFormer, a transformer-based deep learning model that reconstructs the SiC Raman substrate contribution directly from post-growth partially masked spectroscopic data without relying on explicit reference measurements. By learning global correlations across the entire Raman shift range, the model captures the statistical structure of the SiC background and enables accurate reconstruction of its contribution in mixed spectra. Subtraction of the reconstructed substrate signal reveals weak vibrational features associated with ZLG that are inaccessible through conventional analysis methods. The extracted spectra are validated by ab initio vibrational calculations, allowing assignment of the resolved features to specific modes and confirming their physical consistency. By leveraging a state-of-the-art attention-based deep learning architecture, this approach establishes a robust, reference-free framework for Raman analysis of graphene on SiC and provides a foundation, compatible with real-time data acquisition, to its integration into automated, closed-loop AI-assisted growth optimization.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04445v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Scattering of a weakly bound dimer from a hard wall in one dimension</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04662</link><description>arXiv:2601.04662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a dimer formed by two particles with an attractive contact interaction in one dimension, colliding with a hard wall. We compute the scattering phase shifts and the reflection coefficients for various collision energies and various mass ratios of the two particles. For low-energy collisions (with dimer kinetic energies much smaller than the binding energy) our results are consistent with those of D. Lee and M. Pine, The European Physical Journal A 47, 41 (2011). For mass ratios much greater than 1 we use the Born-Oppenheimer approximation to show that the scattering length and the effective range of the dimer-wall collision both depend logarithmically on the mass ratio. For collision energies much greater than the binding energy, the dissociation probability is inversely proportional to the square of the incident momentum of the dimer and we find the constant of proportionality analytically, and we use a semiclassical analysis to approximately derive the ``angular distribution" of the dissociated pair, where the ``angle" $\theta$ depends on the ratio of the velocities of the two outgoing unbound particles.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04662v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Multigap nodeless superconductivity in Dirac semimetal PdTe</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04712</link><description>arXiv:2601.04712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PdTe has recently been reported to be a type-II Dirac semimetal while a bulk nodal and surface nodeless superconductivity (SC) has been claimed to coexist. In this work, we applied point-contact spectroscopy (PCS) method to systematically study the superconducting gap in PdTe single crystals with a SC transition temperature $T_{c}=4.3$ K. The obtained differential conductance curves show a common deviation from a single-gap superconducting behavior and can be better fitted by a two-gap Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model, suggesting the larger gap $\Delta_{L}$ with $2\Delta_{L}$=3.7 $k_{B}T_{c}$ and the smaller gap $\Delta_S$ yielding $2\Delta_{S}$=1.1-2.2 $k_{B}T_{c}$ with a weak interband scattering. The variations of conductance spectra among different contacts are proposed to be caused by the anisotropy of Fermi surface topology associated with different gaps.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04712v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Topological sensing of superfluid rotation using non-Hermitian optical dimers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04749</link><description>arXiv:2601.04749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate a non-Hermitian optical dimer whose parameters are renormalized by dispersive and dissipative backaction from the coupling of the passive cavity with a ring-trapped Bose-Einstein condensate. The passive cavity is driven by a two-tone control laser, where each tone is in a coherent superposition of Laguerre-Gaussian beams carrying orbital angular momenta $\pm \ell \hbar$. This imprints an optical lattice on the ring trap, leading to Bragg-diffracted sidemode excitations. Using an exact Schur-complement reduction of the full light-matter dynamics, we derive a frequency-dependent self-energy and identify a static regime in which the atomic response produces a complex shift of the passive optical mode. This renormalized dimer supports a tunable exceptional point, enabling spectroscopic signatures in the optical transmission due to a probe field, which can in turn be utilized for estimating the winding number of the persistent current. Exploiting the associated half-integer topological charge, we propose a digital exceptional-point-based sensing scheme based on eigenmode permutation, providing a noise-resilient method to sense superfluid rotation without relying on fragile eigenvalue splittings. Importantly, the sensing proposals are intrinsically non-destructive, preserving the coherence of the atomic superfluid.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04749v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Tuning Excitonic Properties and Charge Carrier Dynamics by Halide Alloying in Cs3Bi2(Br1-xIx)9 semiconductors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04771</link><description>arXiv:2601.04771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The perovskite-inspired bismuth halide semiconductor Cs3Bi2Br9 is widely investigated as photoactive material for light-conversion applications. However, charge generation and separation are inherently limited by its modest sunlight absorption and strong exciton binding energy, respectively. Here, we demonstrate that both the light absorption and exciton dissociation are improved by controlled substitution of Br with I via mechanochemical synthesis of Cs3Bi2(Br1-xIx)9. X-ray diffraction and Raman analyses confirm atomic-level halide mixing and reveal a crystallographic phase transition near x = 0.8. From absorption measurements on thin films, we determine the absorption coefficient, Urbach tail, and exciton binding energy for several Cs3Bi2(Br1-xIx)9 compositions. From here, we find that the band gap can be tuned from 2.59 to 1.93 eV (for x = 0.9), while exciton binding energies reach a minimum at x = 0.6. Finally, transient absorption spectroscopy measurements suggest a weak correlation between recombination lifetime and Urbach energy, where the longest lifetimes are observed for the materials with lowest disorder. These results offer valuable insights for designing stable bismuth halide semiconductors with favorable light absorption properties and charge carrier dynamics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04771v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Floquet-driven tunneling control in monolayer MoS$_2$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04837</link><description>arXiv:2601.04837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how fermions in molybdenum disulfide MoS$_2$ interact with a laser field and a static potential barrier, focusing on the transmission probability. Our aim is to understand and control photon-assisted quantum transport in this two-dimensional material under external driving. We use the Floquet approximation to describe the wave functions in the three regions of the system. By applying continuity conditions at the boundaries, we obtain a set of equations involving an infinite number of Floquet modes. We explicitly determine transmissions involving the central band $E$ and the first sidebands $E \pm \hbar\omega$. As for higher-order bands, we use the transfer matrix approach together with current density to compute the associated transmissions. Our results reveal that the transmission probability oscillates for both spin-up and spin-down electrons. The oscillations of spin-down electrons occur over nearly twice the period of spin-up electrons. Among all bands, the central one consistently shows the highest transmission. We also find that stronger laser fields and wider barriers both lead to reduced transmission. Moreover, laser irradiation enables controllable channeling and filtering of transmission bands by tuning the laser intensity and system parameters. This highlights the potential of laser-driven MoS$_2$ structures for highly sensitive electromagnetic sensors and advanced optoelectronic devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04837v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Three-dimensional Moir\'e crystallography</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04971</link><description>arXiv:2601.04971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e materials, typically confined to stacking atomically thin, two - dimensional (2D) layers such as graphene or transition metal dichalcogenides, have transformed our understanding of strongly correlated and topological quantum phenomena. The lattice mismatch and relative twist angle between 2D layers have shown to result in Moir\'e patterns associated with widely tunable electronic properties, ranging from Mott and Chern insulators to semi- and super-conductors. Extended to three-dimensional (3D) structures, Moir\'e materials unlock an entirely new crystallographic space defined by the elements of the 3D rotation group and translational symmetry of the constituent lattices. 3D Moir\'e crystals exhibit fascinating novel properties, often not found in the individual components, yet the general construction principles of 3D Moir\'e crystals remain largely unknown. Here we establish fundamental mathematical principles of 3D Moir\'e crystallography and propose a general method of 3D Moir\'e crystal construction using Clifford algebras over the field of rational numbers. We illustrate several examples of 3D Moir\'e structures representing realistic chemical frameworks and highlight their potential applications in condensed matter physics and solid-state chemistry.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04971v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spin-aligned butterfly spectral map in Non-Hermitian quasicrystals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04986</link><description>arXiv:2601.04986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Non-Hermitian spinful Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) model in the presence of Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) and a spatially varying textured magnetic field is studied. Interestingly, our analysis produces a butterfly spectral map due to the non-trivial extent of localization of the states in the spectrum. This spectral map also exhibits an asymmetric spin alignment with respect to the wings of the butterfly. Our analysis also suggests that the onset of such a spectral map is a combined effect of the non-hermiticity, spin-orbit interaction, and the textured magnetic field.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04986v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Electrically Switchable Flat Band in Two-Dimensional Electron Gases under Nonuniform Magnetic Fields</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05064</link><description>arXiv:2601.05064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat bands are associated with a range of desirable physical phenomena and potential applications, including enhanced superconducting tendencies due to the high density of states, strongly correlated phases such as quantum Hall states. Systems in which flat bands can be switched or tuned are therefore of particular interest. In this study, we analyze the electronic structure of two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) subjected to a linearly increasing magnetic-field dipole together with a transverse electric field, using the operator formalism of the quantum harmonic oscillator. When the electric field magnitude is tuned to a sequence of discrete values, different levels of energy bands are flattened. Moreover, at a specific electric field strength, the ground-state wave function admits an exact closed-form solution that can be understood through the magnetic drifts cancellation in the classical electrodynamics. We also demonstrate two distinct transmission properties, the quantized Hall conductance and the enhanced density of states, of the electrically switchable flat band. These findings establish a new route toward magnetoelectric band engineering and electrically guided transport in low-dimensional systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05064v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Full counting statistics in the sine--Gordon model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05079</link><description>arXiv:2601.05079v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Coexistence of surface superconductivity and Fermi arcs in trigonal $\gamma$-PtBi$_2$ has recently attracted attention for possible realization of topological superconductivity. The Fermi arcs on the two different (0001) surface terminations have been associated with the set of Weyl points just above the Fermi energy (E$_F$). Here using first-principles calculations to explore the band crossings over the full Brillouin zone between the nominally highest valence and lowest conduction bands in $\gamma$-PtBi$_2$, we find a Weyl nodal loop (WNL) and multiple sets of Weyl points (WPs). The main difference between the two reported experimental structural parameters is the magnitude of Bi-layer buckling. While the WNL, bulk gap region and the set of Weyl points just above the E$_F$ are robust, the number and location of the other sets of WPs depend sensitively on the structural parameters with different magnitude of Bi-layer buckling. Besides calculating the 2D Fermi surface with Fermi arcs and quasi-particle interference (QPI) around the E$_F$ in good agreements with ARPES and experimental QPI, we also predict new Fermi arc features at higher energy.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05123v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Acoustic signatures of the field-induced electronic-topological transitions in YbNi$_4$P$_2$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05126</link><description>arXiv:2601.05126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the magnetoelastic properties of an YbNi$_4$P$_2$ single crystal at low temperatures under magnetic fields directed along the crystallographic [001] axis. We report a series of strong anomalies in the sound velocity, which is consistent with the cascade of electronic-topological transitions reported previously for this compound. In particular, we identify the vanishing of a small orbit on the Fermi surface, associated with a quantum-oscillation frequency of 34 T. Furthermore, the different transitions are better resolved with acoustic modes of particular symmetry. Using a microscopic model adapted to the strongly correlated electronic structure of YbNi$_4$P$_2$, we describe our results by inspecting realistic electron-phonon couplings in reciprocal space for each acoustic mode. This shows how the $k$ selectivity of ultrasound experiments allows to investigate Fermi-surface reconstructions in strongly correlated electronic systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05126v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Prediction of Magnetic Topological Materials Combining Spin and Magnetic Space Groups</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05142</link><description>arXiv:2601.05142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scarcity of predicted magnetic topological materials (MTMs) by magnetic space group (MSG) hinders further exploration towards realistic device applications. Here, we propose a new scheme combining spin space groups (SSGs)--approximate symmetry groups neglecting spin-orbit coupling (SOC)--and MSGs to diagnose topology in collinear magnetic materials based on symmetry-indicator theory, enabling a systematic classification of the electronic topology across 484 experimentally synthesized collinear magnets from the MAGNDATA database. This new scheme exploits a symmetry-hierarchy due to SOC induced symmetry-breaking, so that nontrivial band topology can be revealed by SSG, that is yet invisible by the conventional MSG-based method, as exemplified by real triple points in ferromagnetic CaCu$_3$Fe$_2$Sb$_2$O$_{12}$, Dirac nodal lines at generic $k$-points in antiferromagnetic FePSe$_3$ and Weyl nodal lines in altermagnetic Sr$_4$Fe$_4$O$_{11}$. Notably, FePSe$_3$ is topologically trivial under MSG but hosts Dirac nodal lines within the SSG framework. Upon including SOC, these nodal lines are gapped and generate a sizable anomalous Hall conductivity. Despite a vanishing bulk net magnetism, FePSe$_3$ can host topologically protected surface states with large non-relativistic band spin-splitting. Moreover, topology in MTMs is tunable by rotating the magnetic moment direction once SOC is included, as exemplified in Sr$_4$Fe$_4$O$_{11}$.The interplay of topology with non-relativistic and SOC-induced control of properties via magnetic moment reorientation in the predicted MTMs is worthy of further studies in future.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05142v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Local Multimodal Dynamics in Mixed Ionic-Electronic Conductors and Their Fingerprints in Organic Electrochemical Transistor Operation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05179</link><description>arXiv:2601.05179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed ionic-electronic conductors host tightly coupled interactions among mobile ions, electronic charges, and the polymer matrix, giving rise to complex multimodal responses spanning electrical, mechanical, and morphological transformations. These materials underpin organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), which translate such interactions into low-voltage signal amplification and sensing for applications in bioelectronics, neuromorphic computing, and memory. Despite their central role, OECT current-voltage transfer characteristics are often treated phenomenologically, as both the local multimodal dynamics and their connection to global device response remain unresolved. Here, we reveal that the transfer curve encodes a cascade of spatially localized electrochemical transitions, each associated with distinct changes in conductivity, stiffness, and morphology, fundamentally redefining it as a spatially resolved fingerprint of device's internal state. Using automated operando multimodal in-liquid scanning dielectric microscopy, we directly map these dynamics and identify region-specific electrochemical thresholds governing the interplay between source, channel, and drain. We found that the local tip-sample electrostatic force serves as a remarkable mechanistic observable of coupled multimodal dynamics in mixed conductors. A physically grounded model links it to general material, interfacial, and geometric parameters, enabling mechanistic interpretation and predictive insights. Our work provides a new framework for probing and understanding mixed conduction in ion-electron coupled systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05179v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Framing Anomaly in Lattice Chern-Simons-Maxwell Theory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04318</link><description>arXiv:2601.04318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Framing anomaly is a key property of $(2+1)d$ chiral topological orders, for it reveals that the chirality is an intrinsic bulk property of the system, rather than a property of the boundary between two systems. Understanding framing anomaly in lattice models is particularly interesting, as concrete, solvable lattice models of chiral topological orders are rare. In a recent work, we defined and solved the $U(1)$ Chern-Simons-Maxwell theory on spacetime lattice, showing its chiral edge mode and the associated gravitational anomaly on boundary. In this work, we show its framing anomaly in the absence of boundary, by computing the expectation of a lattice version of the modular $T$ operator in the ground subspace on a spatial torus, from which we extract that $\langle T \rangle$ has a universal phase of $-2\pi/12$ as expected: $-2\pi/8$ from the Gauss-Milgram sum of the topological spins of the ground states, and $2\pi/24$ from the framing anomaly; we can also extract the $2\pi/24$ framing anomaly phase alone from the full spectrum of $T$ in the ground subspace by computing $\langle T^m \rangle$. This pins down the last and most crucial property required for a valid lattice definition of $U(1)$ Chern-Simons theory.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04318v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Momentum-Space Entanglement Entropy as a Universal Signature of Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04535</link><description>arXiv:2601.04535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a momentum-space entanglement entropy to quantify quantum correlations between distinct momentum modes following a quench. We prove analytically in the transverse-field Ising (TFI) model and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain that every critical momentum $k^{*}$ associated with a dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) saturates its entanglement entropy to the maximal value $\ln{d}$ ($d=2$ in TFI and SSH models), coinciding with the vanishing of the Loschmidt echo. This saturation of mode entanglement thus provides a universal, direct signature of DQPTs. Our work thus establishes a unified, entanglement-based perspective on dynamical quantum phase transitions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04535v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Unconventional superconductivity mediated by exciton density wave fluctuations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09148</link><description>arXiv:2410.09148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic platforms afford an unparalleled degree of controllability in realizing strongly-correlated phases of matter. In this work, we study the possibility of electrically tunable exciton-mediated superconductivity arising in charge-imbalanced bilayer semiconductors. Focusing on the case of a bilayer semiconductor heterostructure, we identify the gating conditions required to achieve exciton density wave order within a self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation. We analyze the role of the coupling of excitonic fluctuations to the fermionic charge carriers to find that the Goldstone mode of the density wave order can mediate attractive interactions leading to superconductivity. Furthermore, when the system is close to the density wave ordering, the interactions mediated by low-energy exciton modes can support an interlayer pair-density wave superconductor of anisotropic character. We discuss experimental signatures associated with these phenomena.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.09148v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Magnetization-Tunable Topological Phase Transitions in Ferromagnetic Kagome Monolayers of Co$_3$X$_3$Y$_2$ ($X=\mathrm{Sn},\mathrm{Pb}$; $Y=\mathrm{S},\mathrm{Se}$)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06686</link><description>arXiv:2502.06686v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect in magnetic kagome materials has emerged as a versatile platform for dissipationless electronic and spintronic devices. In this work, we demonstrate that the orientation of magnetic moments $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$ at lattice sites provides a practical tuning mechanism for engineering nontrivial topological phases in monolayer kagome ferromagnets. To elucidate the mechanism, we construct a symmetry-adapted minimal tight-binding model for kagome ferromagnets that includes intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and the intrinsic Rashba SOC permitted by broken out-of-plane mirror symmetry between nearest-neighbor kagome sites and can capture the resulting topological phase diagram as a function of $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$. In particular, the restoration of in-plane mirror symmetry for specific values of $\phi$ drives a topological phase transition upon varying the in-plane orientation of the moments $\hat{m}(\theta = 90^{\circ}, \phi)$. In contrast, for fixed $\phi$, the transitions driven by varying $\theta$ originate from the competition between Rashba SOC and intrinsic SOC. Density functional theory calculations for ferromagnetic kagome monolayers belonging to the Co$_3$X$_3$Y$_2$ family ($X=\mathrm{Sn},\mathrm{Pb}$; $Y=\mathrm{S},\mathrm{Se}$) support the predictions of the proposed minimal tight-binding model. These findings provide design guidelines for tunable topological phases in kagome materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.06686v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Characterizing the cage state of glassy systems and its sensitivity to frozen boundaries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16339</link><description>arXiv:2507.16339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the role that structure plays in the dynamical arrest observed in glassy systems remains an open challenge. Over the last decade, machine learning (ML) strategies have emerged as an important tool for probing this structure-dynamics relationship, particularly for predicting heterogeneous glassy dynamics from local structure. A recent advancement is the introduction of the cage state, a structural quantity that captures the average positions of particles while rearrangements are forbidden. During the caging regime, linear models trained on the cage state have been shown to outperform more complex ML methods trained on initial configurations only. In this paper, we explore the properties associated with the cage state in more detail to better understand why it serves as such an effective predictor for the dynamics. Specifically, we examine how the cage state in a binary hard-sphere mixture is influenced by both packing fraction and boundary conditions. Our results reveal that, as the system approaches the glassy regime, the cage state becomes increasingly influenced by long-range structural effects. This influence is evident both in its predictive power for particle dynamics and in the internal structure of the cage state, suggesting that the CS might be associated with some form of an amorphous growing structural length scale.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.16339v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Predictive models for strain energy in condensed phase reactions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15592</link><description>arXiv:2508.15592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular modeling of thermally activated chemistry in condensed phases is essential to understand polymerization, depolymerization, and other processing steps of molecular materials. Current methods typically combine molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to describe short-time relaxation with a stochastic description of predetermined chemical reactions. Possible reactions are often selected on the basis of geometric criteria, such as a capture distance between reactive atoms. Although these simulations have provided valuable insight, the approximations used to determine possible reactions often lead to significant molecular strain and unrealistic structures. We show that the local molecular environment surrounding the reactive site plays a crucial role in determining the resulting molecular strain energy and, in turn, the associated reaction rates. We develop a graph neural network capable of predicting the strain energy associated with a cyclization reaction from the pre-reaction, local, molecular environment surrounding the reactive site. The model is trained on a large dataset of condensed-phase reactions during the activation of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) obtained from MD simulations and can be used to adjust relative reaction rates in condensed systems and advance our understanding of thermally activated chemical processes in complex materials</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.15592v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Thickness dependent rare earth segregation in magnetron deposited NdCo$_{4.6}$ thin films studied by Xray reflectivity and Hard Xray photoemission</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23852</link><description>arXiv:2510.23852v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic anisotropy in disordered rare-earth-transition metals (RE-TM) compounds arises from RE atoms occupying asymmetric environments within the TM lattice. However, the underlying mechanism that promotes such environments remains not fully understood. In this study, we investigate amorphous NdCo$_{4.6}$ thin films deposited by magnetron sputtering, where the magnetic anisotropy evolves with thickness from in-plane to out-of-plane orientation above 40 nm. X-ray reflectivity measurements revealed the progressive formation of an additional layer between the 3 nm Si capping layer and the NdCo film with increasing film thickness. To probe the composition and distribution of Co and Nd near the surface, Hard X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy (HAXPES) was performed on films ranging from 5 nm to 65 nm in thickness using incident photon energies of 7, 19, and 13 keV. These correspond to inelastic electron mean free paths of 7.2-12.3 nm in cobalt. The cobalt atomic concentration, deduced from HAXPES at the Nd 3d and Co 2p excitations, was consistently below the nominal value and varied with both thickness and photon energy. This indicates segregation of RE atoms at the film surface, which becomes more pronounced with increasing thickness. Background analysis of the Co 2p and Nd 3d peaks supports this conclusion. The thickness of the Nd segregated layer is estimated in 2-3 nm. These findings demonstrate that incorporating neodymium into the cobalt lattice incurs an energy cost which is associated with strain due to the volume mismatch between the two elements. Reducing this strain energy promotes anisotropic atomic environments for Nd, thereby explaining the emergence of perpendicular anisotropy and its dependence on film thickness in these RE-TM compounds.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.23852v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interaction-Induced Quasicrystalline Order: Emergence of Quasi-Solid and Quasi-Supersolid Phases</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02218</link><description>arXiv:2511.02218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deterministic quasiperiodicity in quantum systems has long been associated with localization, criticality, or glassy behavior, and has therefore been believed to suppress long-range order rather than stabilize it. Here we demonstrate the opposite: quasiperiodicity in interactions--without any quasiperiodic potential, disorder, or geometric modulation--can generate coherent, ordered quantum phases. We study hard-core bosons in one dimension with quasiperiodic long-range interactions, V_{ij}=V_0 \cos(\pi \alpha i)\cos(\pi \alpha j), where n=\alpha=(\sqrt{5}-1)/2 is the inverse golden ratio. Using large-scale path-integral quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover thermodynamically stable incompressible plateaus at irrational densities tied to Fibonacci ratios. These plateaus exhibit sharp incommensurate Bragg peaks, signaling an emergent quasi-solid with long-range quasicrystalline density order. More strikingly, at nearby fillings and interaction strengths, we identify a quasi-supersolid phase that supports both Fibonacci density ordering and finite superfluid density--demonstrating that interaction-induced quasiperiodicity can stabilize supersolid coherence. Our results establish a new mechanism for realizing ordered quasicrystalline quantum matter, and provide realistic guidance for implementation in Rydberg atom arrays, multimode cavity-QED systems, and trapped-ion quantum simulators.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.02218v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Hybrid Disclination Skin-topological Effects in Non-Hermitian Circuits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02862</link><description>arXiv:2601.02862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bulk-disclination correspondence (BDC) is a fundamental concept in Hermitian systems that has been widely applied to predict disclination states. Recently, disclination states have also been observed and experimentally verified in non-Hermitian systems with C6 lattice symmetry, where gain and loss are introduced to induce non-Hermiticity. In this Letter, we propose a non-Hermitian two-dimensional (2D) Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) disclination model with skin-topological (ST) disclination states, and calculate its biorthogonal Zak phase. Together with the real-space disclination index, we predict the emergence of disclination states in a C4-symmetric non-Hermitian lattice and the corresponding fractional charge. We also generalize the symmetry indicator within the biorthogonal framework to predict the anomalous filling near the disclination core. Experimentally, the model is implemented on a nonreciprocal circuit platform, where we analyze the impedance matrix characterized by complex eigenfrequencies and directly observe the ST disclination states. Our work further extends the bulk-disclination correspondence to the non-Hermitian realm.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02862v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Redundancy Channels in the Conformal Bootstrap</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05338</link><description>arXiv:2507.05338v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A method for obstructing symmetry enhancement in numerical conformal bootstrap calculations is proposed. Symmetry enhancement refers to situations where bootstrap studies initialised with a certain symmetry end up allowing theories with higher symmetry. In such cases, it is shown that redundant operators in the less symmetric theory can descend from primary scaling operators of the more symmetric one, motivating the imposition of spectral gaps that are justified in the former but not the latter. The same mechanism can also be used to differentiate between decoupled and fully coupled theories which otherwise have the same global symmetry. A systematic understanding of this mechanism is developed and applied to distinguish the cubic from the $O(3)$ model in three dimensions, where a strip of disallowed parameter space, referred to as the cubic redundancy channel, emerges once a gap associated with a redundant operator of the cubic theory is imposed. The channel corresponds precisely to the region of parameter space where the assumed cubic symmetry would be enhanced to $O(3)$.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.05338v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The Thermodynamics of the Gravity from Entropy Theory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22545</link><description>arXiv:2510.22545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gravity from Entropy (GfE) action posits that the fundamental nature of gravity is information encoded in the metric degrees of freedom. This statistical mechanics theory is associated with the GfE Lagrangian given by the Geometric Quantum Relative Entropy (GQRE) between the true metric and the metric induced by the matter fields and the curvature. The GfE action leads to the GfE modified gravity equations displaying an emergent dynamical cosmological constant. Interestingly, the GfE equations of motion reduce to the Einstein equations in the limit of low energy and small curvature. Here we embrace a thermodynamic point of view and we associate the energy density of the GfE to the emergent dynamical cosmological constant of the theory. Focusing on homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes, we reveal that the GfE universes associated with the FRW metrics are thermal. Indeed they are associated with the $k$-temperatures and the $k$-pressures which are related to their local GQRE and their local energy by the first law of GfE thermodynamics. The thermodynamics of the GfE theory is illustrated in the low energy, small curvature limit with matter content modelled as perfect fluid, where the solutions of the GfE equations of motion are well approximated by the Friedmann universes. We show that while the total GQRE per unit volume is not increasing, coherently with its relative entropy nature, the total entropy of GfE universes is not decreasing in time. These results provide a natural thermodynamic interpretation of GfE cosmologies and a framework for reconciling local complexity with the global increase in entropy of the universe.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.22545v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Memory-Guided Unified Hardware Accelerator for Mixed-Precision Scientific Computing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04476</link><description>arXiv:2601.04476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent hardware acceleration advances have enabled powerful specialized accelerators for finite element computations, spiking neural network inference, and sparse tensor operations. However, existing approaches face fundamental limitations: (1) finite element methods lack comprehensive rounding error analysis for reduced-precision implementations and use fixed precision assignment strategies that cannot adapt to varying numerical conditioning; (2) spiking neural network accelerators cannot handle non-spike operations and suffer from bit-width escalation as network depth increases; and (3) FPGA tensor accelerators optimize only for dense computations while requiring manual configuration for each sparsity pattern. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{Memory-Guided Unified Hardware Accelerator for Mixed-Precision Scientific Computing}, a novel framework that integrates three enhanced modules with memory-guided adaptation for efficient mixed-workload processing on unified platforms. Our approach employs memory-guided precision selection to overcome fixed precision limitations, integrates experience-driven bit-width management and dynamic parallelism adaptation for enhanced spiking neural network acceleration, and introduces curriculum learning for automatic sparsity pattern discovery. Extensive experiments on FEniCS, COMSOL, ANSYS benchmarks, MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, DVS-Gesture datasets, and COCO 2017 demonstrate 2.8\% improvement in numerical accuracy, 47\% throughput increase, 34\% energy reduction, and 45-65\% throughput improvement compared to specialized accelerators. Our work enables unified processing of finite element methods, spiking neural networks, and sparse computations on a single platform while eliminating data transfer overhead between separate units.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04476v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] MPM-LLM4DSE: Reaching the Pareto Frontier in HLS with Multimodal Learning and LLM-Driven Exploration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04801</link><description>arXiv:2601.04801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-Level Synthesis (HLS) design space exploration (DSE) seeks Pareto-optimal designs within expansive pragma configuration spaces. To accelerate HLS DSE, graph neural networks (GNNs) are commonly employed as surrogates for HLS tools to predict quality of results (QoR) metrics, while multi-objective optimization algorithms expedite the exploration. However, GNN-based prediction methods may not fully capture the rich semantic features inherent in behavioral descriptions, and conventional multi-objective optimization algorithms often do not explicitly account for the domain-specific knowledge regarding how pragma directives influence QoR. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the MPM-LLM4DSE framework, which incorporates a multimodal prediction model (MPM) that simultaneously fuses features from behavioral descriptions and control and data flow graphs. Furthermore, the framework employs a large language model (LLM) as an optimizer, accompanied by a tailored prompt engineering methodology. This methodology incorporates pragma impact analysis on QoR to guide the LLM in generating high-quality configurations (LLM4DSE). Experimental results demonstrate that our multimodal predictive model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art work ProgSG by up to 10.25$\times$. Furthermore, in DSE tasks, the proposed LLM4DSE achieves an average performance gain of 39.90\% over prior methods, validating the effectiveness of our prompting methodology.

Here, we present a TAT strategy that leverages the cell nucleus-enrichment capability of a 225Ac-labeled, MDM2-targeting stapled peptide for effective treatment of osteosarcoma. Rapid PET/CT-based screening enables precise identification of an optimized MDM2-targeting stapled peptide ligand (tumor uptake: 8.26 %ID/g; nucleus uptake fraction: 18.9 %). A single micro-dose (17 KBq) markedly suppressed osteosarcoma growth with satisfactory safety, resulting in growth arrest in over 50% of tumors without signs of recurrence. Mechanistically, the 225Ac-labeled stapled peptide rapidly triggers cellular stress programs in osteosarcoma and progressively induces the formation of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Our findings suggest that TAT represents an effective therapeutic strategy for osteosarcoma, with MDM2-targeting stapled peptide serving as an ideal ligand for this approach.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-7hg79?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Association-gated multiphoton activation of inert haloarenes via sequential electron donor–acceptor assembly</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-1386d-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The functionalization of recalcitrant chemical bonds that require extreme reduction potentials is often thwarted by the absence of a defined reaction field to control potent intermediates. Conventional multiphoton photocatalysis generates super-reductants, whose immense energy dissipates through chaotic, diffusion-controlled pathways. Herein, an "association-gated" strategy is introduced that constructs sequential electron donor–acceptor (EDA) complexes as programmable reaction microenvironments. This system initially captures a single photon through its sulfide/naphthalene monoimide (NMI) complex. The resulting NMI radical anion serves as a scaffold to pre-organize the haloarene substrate into a second, distinct EDA complex, creating a reaction pocket for the final, energy-storing excitation. Such supramolecular confinement generates an extreme reducing potential at the carbon–halogen bond, suppressing both diffusive side-reactions and parasitic hydrogen atom transfer from amine donors. This unlocks a broad scope of transformations under air-tolerant conditions, providing a versatile tool for late-stage diversification.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-1386d-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Chemical Engineering] Transient pH changes drive vacuole formation in enzyme–polymer condensates</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s44286-025-00322-7</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Chemical Engineering, Published online: 09 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44286-025-00322-7"&gt;doi:10.1038/s44286-025-00322-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Rapid pH changes can trigger hollow vacuoles in associative condensates of pH-responsive biomolecules.

Anxiety and related issues are major health and social concerns in developed countries, affecting 10–20% of the population. The lowest effective inhibitory concentrations for GABA-AT were observed for two compounds: 3h (30.50±0.61 µM) and 3r (44.76±0.49 µM). Their IC50 values were similar to those of lamotrigine. In vitro tests showed that compounds 3h and 3f had the lowest IC50 values for GABA-AT inhibition, at 30.50±0.61 and 44.58±0.54, respectively. The anticonvulsant activity of 6-(4-methoxybenzyl)-3-R-4H-[1,2,4] triazin-5-ones in a corral seizure model depends on modifications to substituents at positions three and six of the heterocyclic 1,2,4-triazine ring. Leading compounds, 3f (3-(4-Chlorophenylamino)-6-(4-methoxybenzyl)-4H-[1,2,4]triazin-5-one) and 3h (3-(2,3-Dimethylphenylamino)-6-(4-methoxybenzyl)-4H-[1,2,4]triazin-5-one), completely inhibit clonic and tonic-clonic seizures. Compound 3r, which contains both tryptamine and triazine fragments, has a clear pharmacophore structure. However, the spatial structure of the pharmacophore in compound 3h, with the lowest binding energy to GABAa and GABA-AT and the best performance in tests, is not yet fully understood.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-4b2m1?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] DNA-Encoded Nanoparticle Interfaces Accelerate Diverse Enzymes Through Noncovalent Association</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-hrvzp?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Enhancing enzyme performance without protein engineering remains a central challenge in biocatalysis. Here, we report the unusual discovery that nanoparticles densely functionalized with DNA can bind enzymes without chemical conjugation, affinity tags, or engineered recognition motifs, and substantially increase catalytic activity. This effect generalizes across multiple enzyme classes: cytochrome c and catalase exhibit ~9.4-fold and ~3.0-fold higher peroxidase activity, while carbonic anhydrase shows a ~1.6-fold increased esterase activity, underscoring the versatility of this system. Mechanistic studies indicate that enhancement is an emergent property of the three-dimensional, high-density DNA shell, with the core functioning primarily as a scaffold. Activity modulation is governed not only by DNA density and length, but also, critically, by DNA sequence, establishing sequence design as a programmable handle for tuning enzyme output. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations reveal that base-specific interactions reshape enzyme conformational flexibility and increase active-site accessibility. We further show sequence-encoded control in multienzyme systems through a DNA-programmed cascade where DNA-functionalized glucose oxidase recruits cytochrome c at the DNA interface, yielding &gt;4.8-fold higher cascade efficiency than free-enzyme mixtures. Together, these findings position DNA-functionalized nanoparticles as adaptable, sequence-programmable platforms for improving and coordinating biocatalysis, opening new routes for enzyme control in synthesis, diagnostics, and therapeutic design.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-hrvzp?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Abstract: Predicting the melting temperature (Tm) of multi-component and high-entropy alloys (HEAs) is critical for high-temperature applications but computationally expensive using traditional CALPHAD or DFT methods. In this work, we develop a gradient-boosted decision tree (XGBoost) model to predict Tm for complex alloys based on elemental properties. To ensure physical consistency, we address the issue of data leakage by excluding temperature-dependent thermodynamic descriptors (such as Gibbs free energy of mixing) and instead rely on physically motivated elemental features. The optimized model achieves a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.948 and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 9928 which is about 5% relative error for HEAs on a validation set of approximately 1300 compositions. Crucially, we validate the model using the Valence Electron Concentration (VEC) rule. Without explicit constraints during training, the model successfully captures the known stability transition between BCC and FCC phases at a VEC of approximately 6.87. These results demonstrate that data-driven models, when properly feature-engineered, can capture fundamental metallurgical principles for rapid alloy screening.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03801v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Material exploration through active learning -- METAL</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03933</link><description>arXiv:2601.03933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery and design of new materials are paramount in the development of green technologies. High entropy oxides represent one such group that has only been tentatively explored, mainly due to the inherent problem of navigating vast compositional spaces. Thanks to the emergence of machine learning, however, suitable tools are now readily available. Here, the task of finding oxygen carriers for chemical looping processes has been tackled by leveraging active learning-based strategies combined with first-principles calculations. High efficiency and efficacy have, moreover, been achieved by exploiting the power of recently developed machine learning interatomic potentials. Firstly, the proposed approaches were validated based on an established computational framework for identifying high entropy perovskites that can be used in chemical looping air separation and dry reforming. Chief among the insights thus gained was the identification of the best performing strategies, in the form of greedy or Thompson-based sampling based on uncertainty estimates obtained from Gaussian processes. Building on this newfound knowledge, the concept was applied to a more complex problem, namely the discovery of high entropy oxygen carriers for chemical looping oxygen uncoupling. This resulted in both qualitative as well as quantitative outcomes, including lists of specific materials with high oxygen transfer capacities and configurational entropies. Specifically, the best candidates were based on the known oxygen carrier CaMnO3 but also contained a variety of additional species, of which some, e.g., Ti; Co; Cu; and Ti, were expected while others were not, e.g., Y and Sm. The results suggest that adopting active learning approaches is critical in materials discovery, given that these methods are already shifting research practice and soon will be the norm.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03933v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Transport properties in a model of confined granular mixtures at moderate densities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04026</link><description>arXiv:2601.04026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work derives the Navier--Stokes hydrodynamic equations for a model of a confined, quasi-two-dimensional, $s$-component mixture of inelastic, smooth, hard spheres. Using the inelastic version of the revised Enskog theory, macroscopic balance equations for mass, momentum, and energy are obtained, and constitutive equations for the fluxes are determined through a first-order Chapman--Enskog expansion. As for elastic collisions, the transport coefficients are given in terms of the solutions of a set of coupled linear integral equations. Approximate solutions to these equations for diffusion transport coefficients and shear viscosity are achieved by assuming steady-state conditions and considering leading terms in a Sonine polynomial expansion. These transport coefficients are expressed in terms of the coefficients of restitution, concentration, the masses and diameters of the mixture's components, and the system's density. The results apply to moderate densities and are not limited to particular values of the coefficients of restitution, concentration, mass, and/or diameter ratios. As an application, the thermal diffusion factor is evaluated to analyze segregation driven by temperature gradients and gravity, providing criteria that distinguish whether larger particles accumulate near the hotter or colder boundaries.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04026v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] libMobility: A Python library for hydrodynamics at the Smoluchowski level</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02135</link><description>arXiv:2510.02135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective hydrodynamic modeling is crucial for accurately predicting fluid-particle interactions in diverse fields such as biophysics and materials science. Developing and implementing hydrodynamic algorithms is challenging due to the complexity of fluid dynamics, necessitating efficient management of large-scale computations and sophisticated boundary conditions. Furthermore, adapting these algorithms for use on massively parallel architectures like GPUs adds an additional layer of complexity. This paper presents the libMobility software library, which offers a suite of CUDA-enabled solvers for simulating hydrodynamic interactions in particulate systems at the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa (RPY) level. The library facilitates precise simulations of particle displacements influenced by external forces and torques, including both the deterministic and stochastic components. Notable features of libMobility include its ability to handle linear and angular displacements, thermal fluctuations, and various domain geometries effectively. With an interface in Python, libMobility provides comprehensive tools for researchers in computational fluid dynamics and related fields to simulate particle mobility efficiently. This article details the technical architecture, functionality, and wide-ranging applications of libMobility. libMobility is available at https://github.com/stochasticHydroTools/libMobility.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.02135v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Kinetic Flux Equations for Ion Exchange in Silicate Glasses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03207</link><description>arXiv:2601.03207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ion exchange kinetic flux equations have been extensively investigated since the mid-twentieth century and continue to provide a fundamental framework for describing mass transport phenomena in solid materials. Despite the maturity of this field, inconsistencies remain in the literature concerning the definition, dimensional consistency, and physical interpretation of the parameters involved. A rigorous and unified treatment of these equations is therefore essential to ensure the reproducibility and comparability of theoretical and experimental studies. The present study aims to establish a coherent and systematic development of ion exchange kinetic flux equations, with particular emphasis on the consistent definition and dimensional formulation of the relevant physical quantities. Beyond refining the theoretical foundations, this study extends the classical formulation by incorporating the influence of mechanical stress on ion transport and considering cross-term interactions within the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics. These developments provide a more comprehensive description of ion exchange kinetics, particularly as applied to silicate glasses, where coupling between chemical and mechanical effects plays a crucial role in determining transport behavior and performance.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03207v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Agentic Exploration of Physics Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24978</link><description>arXiv:2509.24978v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations, analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an open challenge to fully automate the heuristic, iterative loop required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large language model tool-use capabilities to enable exploration of systems without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution, and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains, without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.24978v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Masgent: An AI-assisted Materials Simulation Agent</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23010</link><description>arXiv:2512.23010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning potentials (MLPs) are essential for predicting and understanding materials properties, yet preparing, executing, and analyzing these simulations typically requires extensive scripting, multi-step procedures, and significant high-performance computing (HPC) expertise. These challenges hinder reproducibility and slow down discovery. Here, we introduce Masgent, an AI-assisted materials simulation agent that unifies structure manipulation, automated VASP input generation, DFT workflow construction and analysis, fast MLP-based simulations, and lightweight machine learning (ML) utilities within a single platform. Powered by large language models (LLMs), Masgent enables researchers to perform complex simulation tasks through natural-language interaction, eliminating most manual scripting and reducing setup time from hours to seconds. By standardizing protocols and integrating advanced simulation and data-driven tools, Masgent lowers the barrier to performing state-of-the-art computational methodologies, enabling faster hypothesis testing, pre-screening, and exploratory research for both new and experienced practitioners.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23010v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interlayer Charge-Transfer Ferroelectric Fluctuations as a Pairing Mechanism in van der Waals Superconductors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03352</link><description>arXiv:2601.03352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signatures of unconventional superconductivity have been reported in a wide range of van der Waals (vdW) materials. However, their microscopic origin remains unclear due to competing electronic orders, strong spin-orbit coupling, and structural instabilities in the normal state. Here we investigate the role of interlayer breathing and shear modes in superconducting vdW heterostructures. Contrary to conventional wisdom -- which assumes that weak interlayer bonding and large layer separation suppress electronic coupling to these modes -- we show that the associated charge transfer can generate a substantial pairing interaction. We develop a theory of superconductivity mediated by such interlayer modes and demonstrate that proximity to a ferroelectric or antiferroelectric quantum critical point provides a strong-coupling pairing channel. Within a two-dimensional model with SU(2) symmetry and in-plane isotropy, we find an accidental degeneracy between interlayer triplet states, which can occur even for an $s$-wave in-plane gap. We further show that Josephson coupling between layers, arising from either static magnetism or induced by paramagnetic correlations, can stabilize a time-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconducting state of the $s+i\,s$ type, which couples to magnetization when at least two mirror symmetries are absent. Our results are directly applicable to candidate chiral vdW superconductors such as 4Hb-TaS$_2$ and to sliding ferroelectric metals, exemplified by bilayer MoTe$_2$. More broadly, our work identifies ferroelectric fluctuations as a promising route to unconventional pairing in vdW systems and motivates experimental searches for chiral multicomponent superconductivity.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03352v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The Zubarev Double Time Greens function-A Vintage Many Body Technique</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03439</link><description>arXiv:2601.03439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lecture notes present a comprehensive and powerful many-body technique pioneered in 1960 by D. N. Zubarev. The technique, known as the Zubarev Double Time Greens Function method, was used extensively by leading solid state physicists such as John Hubbard and Laura Roth in the 1960s. We present the technique and apply it to the non-interacting electron and boson gas. We next consider the (many-body) Hubbard model and show how it yields the Stoner criterion for ferromagnetism. It is easily extendable to superconductivity and related problems. Our treatment is pedagogical and understandable to those with just an elementary understanding of second quantization.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03439v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interplay of activity and non-reciprocity in tracer dynamics: From non-equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation to giant diffusion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03591</link><description>arXiv:2601.03591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal interactions play a key role in shaping transport in active and passive systems, giving rise to striking nonequilibrium behavior. Here, we study the dynamics of a tracer -- active or passive -- embedded in a bath of active or passive particles, coupled through non-reciprocal interactions. Starting from the microscopic stochastic dynamics of the full system, we derive an overdamped generalized Langevin equation for the tracer, incorporating a non-Markovian memory kernel that captures bath-mediated correlations. This framework enables us to compute the tracer's velocity and displacement response, derive a generalized nonequilibrium fluctuation-dissipation relation that quantifies deviations from equilibrium behavior, and determine the mean-squared displacement (MSD). We find that while the MSD becomes asymptotically diffusive, the effective diffusivity depends non-monotonically on the degree of non-reciprocity and diverges at an intermediate value. This regime of giant diffusivity provides a generic mechanism for enhanced transport in active soft matter and has direct implications for biological systems exhibiting chase-and-run or predator-prey interactions. Our analytical predictions are supported by numerical simulations of active Brownian particles, highlighting experimentally accessible signatures of non-reciprocal interactions in soft matter.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03591v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interference-Induced Suppression of Doublon Transport and Prethermalization in the Extended Bose-Hubbard Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03694</link><description>arXiv:2601.03694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherent mobility of doublons, arising from second-order virtual dissociation-recombination processes, fundamentally limits their use as information carriers in the strongly interacting Bose-Hubbard model. We propose a disorder-free suppression mechanism by introducing an optimized nearest-neighbor pair-hopping term that destructively interferes with the dominant virtual hopping channel. Using the third-order Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we derive an analytical optimal condition that accounts for lattice geometry corrections. Exact numerical simulations demonstrate that this optimized scheme achieves near-complete dynamical arrest and entanglement preservation in one-dimensional chains, while in two-dimensional square lattices, it significantly suppresses ballistic spreading yet permits a slow residual expansion. Furthermore, in the many-body regime, finite-size scaling analysis identifies the observed long-lived density-wave order as a prethermal plateau emerging from the dramatic separation of microscopic and thermalization timescales.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03694v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Equivariant Neural Networks for Force-Field Models of Lattice Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04104</link><description>arXiv:2601.04104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learning (ML) force fields enable large-scale simulations with near-first-principles accuracy at substantially reduced computational cost. Recent work has extended ML force-field approaches to adiabatic dynamical simulations of condensed-matter lattice models with coupled electronic and structural or magnetic degrees of freedom. However, most existing formulations rely on hand-crafted, symmetry-aware descriptors, whose construction is often system-specific and can hinder generality and transferability across different lattice Hamiltonians. Here we introduce a symmetry-preserving framework based on equivariant neural networks (ENNs) that provides a general, data-driven mapping from local configurations of dynamical variables to the associated on-site forces in a lattice Hamiltonian. In contrast to ENN architectures developed for molecular systems -- where continuous Euclidean symmetries dominate -- our approach aims to embed the discrete point-group and internal symmetries intrinsic to lattice models directly into the neural-network representation of the force field. As a proof of principle, we construct an ENN-based force-field model for the adiabatic dynamics of the Holstein Hamiltonian on a square lattice, a canonical system for electron-lattice physics. The resulting ML-enabled large-scale dynamical simulations faithfully capture mesoscale evolution of the symmetry-breaking phase, illustrating the utility of lattice-equivariant architectures for linking microscopic electronic processes to emergent dynamical behavior in condensed-matter lattice systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04104v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Physics-Informed Gaussian Process Regression for the Constitutive Modeling of Concrete: A Data-Driven Improvement to Phenomenological Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03367</link><description>arXiv:2601.03367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and modeling the constitutive behavior of concrete is crucial for civil and defense applications, yet widely used phenomenological models such as Karagozian \&amp; Case concrete (KCC) model depend on empirically calibrated failure surfaces that lack flexibility in model form and associated uncertainty quantification. This work develops a physics-informed framework that retains the modular elastoplastic structure of KCC model while replacing its empirical failure surface with a constrained Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) surrogate that can be learned directly from experimentally accessible observables. Triaxial compression data under varying confinement levels are used for training, and the surrogate is then evaluated at confinement levels not included in the training set to assess its generalization capability. Results show that an unconstrained GPR interpolates well near training conditions but deteriorates and violates essential physical constraints under extrapolation, even when augmented with simulated data. In contrast, a physics-informed GPR that incorporates derivative-based constraints aligned with known material behavior yields markedly better accuracy and reliability, including at higher confinement levels beyond the training range. Probabilistic enforcement of these constraints also reduces predictive variance, producing tighter confidence intervals in data-scarce regimes. Overall, the proposed approach delivers a robust, uncertainty-aware surrogate that improves generalization and streamlines calibration without sacrificing the interpretability and numerical efficiency of the KCC model, offering a practical path toward an improved constitutive models for concrete.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03367v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interfacial Line Energy of a Topological Phase</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11102</link><description>arXiv:2408.11102v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In interacting topological systems, Landau-like order parameters interplay with the band topology of fermions. The physics of domain formation in such systems can get significantly altered due to the presence of topological fermions. In this work we show that coupling a topological fermionic field to a scalar field can drastically modify the nucleation processes. We find that existence of non-trivial fermionic boundary modes on the nucleating droplets of the scalar field leads to substantial quantum corrections to the interface energy. This leads to an increase in the size of the critical nucleus beyond which unrestricted droplet growth happens. To illustrate the phenomena we devise a minimal model of fermions in a Chern insulating system coupled to a classical Ising field in two spatial dimensions. Using a combination of analytic and numerical methods we conclusively demonstrate that topological phases have a characteristic quantum correction to the interfacial line energy. Apart from material systems, our work opens up a host of questions regarding the impact of fermionic topological terms on classical phase transitions and associated criticality.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2408.11102v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Effective spin model with anisotropic exchange interactions for the spin-orbit coupled Hubbard model at half-filling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05166</link><description>arXiv:2504.05166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in noncentrosymmetric materials is the source of incommensurate magnetic structures. In semiconductors, it drives the Rashba spin splitting and spin momentum locking, while in magnetic insulators based on transition metals, it induces anisotropic spin exchange interactions, like the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction which drives chiral magnetism and skyrmion formation. Here, we establish a direct connection between SOC and spin exchange interactions by deriving an effective spin model from the SOC Hubbard model at half-filling. Using a strong-coupling expansion up to fourth order by including the full set of terms, we identify Heisenberg, Ising-like, and ring exchange interactions, as well as a variety of four-body terms for realistic Hubbard parameters, which impose strong constraints on the relative strengths of the spin interactions. Our spin model shows excellent agreement in energy with the SOC Hubbard model down $U/t \sim 5$ near the metal-insulator transition point, providing insight to which kind of magnetic interactions relevant across this regime are responsible for the emergence of complex magnetic textures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.05166v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Magneto-optical Kerr effect in an A-type antiferromagnet</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16167</link><description>arXiv:2504.16167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) is a powerful probe of broken time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{T}$), typically used to study ferromagnets. While MOKE has been observed in some antiferromagnets (AFMs) with vanishing magnetization, it is often associated with structures whose symmetry is lower than basic collinear, bipartite order. In contrast, theory predicts a mechanism for MOKE intrinsic to all AFMs of A-type, i.e. layered AFMs in which ferromagnetic layers are antiferromagnetically aligned. Here we report the first experimental confirmation of this mechanism in a bulk AFM. We achieve this by measuring the imaginary component of MOKE as a function of photon energy in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, an A-type AFM where $\mathcal{T}$ is preserved in combination with a translation. By comparing the experimental results with model calculations, we demonstrate that observable MOKE should be expected in all collinear A-type AFMs with out-of-plane spin order, thus enabling optical detection of AFM domains and expanding the scope of MOKE to few-layer AFMs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.16167v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Chiral anomaly-induced nonlinear Hall effect in spin-orbit coupled noncentrosymmetric metals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00821</link><description>arXiv:2508.00821v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that chiral anomaly is not limited to Weyl semimetals (WSMs), but are also shown by a larger class of materials called spin orbit coupled noncentrosymmetric metals (SOC-NCMs),which has shed more insight into the origin of chiral anomaly as a Fermi surface property rather than a nodal property. In this study, we explore nonlinear transport responses in SOC-NCMswithin the framework of semiclassical dynamics, employing the Maxwell-Boltzmann transport theory augmented by charge conservation and momentum-dependent scattering processes. We take into account both non-magnetic and magnetic impurity scattering mechanisms. We demonstrate that the chiral-anomaly-induced nonlinear Hall (CNLH) response exhibits a characteristic quadratic dependence on the applied magnetic field and remains negative for both types of impurities. We find that magnetic scatterers leading to enhanced/suppressed interband scattering modifies the magnitude of the signal, but does not affect its qualitative behavior. In contrast, the presence of tilt in the band dispersion induces a pronounced anisotropic response, including a magnetic-field-direction dependent sign reversal that can be categorized into weak and strong regimes. Furthermore, the CNLH response shows substantial directional anisotropy governed by the relative orientation of the external magnetic field and the tilt vector. Our findings will be helpful in designing the experimental setup to get direction-dependent conductivity, which can be tuned externally with the help of magnetic impurity sites.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.00821v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Metrics for spin-based computing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17653</link><description>arXiv:2510.17653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-based computing is emerging as a powerful approach for energy-efficient and high-performance solutions to future data processing hardware. Spintronic devices function by electrically manipulating the collective dynamics of the electron spin, that is inherently non-volatile, nonlinear and fast-operating, and can couple to other degrees of freedom such as photonic and phononic systems. This review explores key advances in integrating magnetic and spintronic elements into computational architectures, ranging from fundamental components like radio-frequency neurons/synapses and spintronic probabilistic-bits to broader frameworks such as reservoir computing and magnetic Ising machines. We discuss hardware-specific and task-dependent metrics to evaluate the computing performance of spin-based components and associate them with physical properties. Finally, we discuss challenges and future opportunities, highlighting the potential of spin-based computing in next-generation technologies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.17653v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Open quantum theory of magnetoresistance in mesoscopic magnetic materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24586</link><description>arXiv:2512.24586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetoresistance (MR) in magnetic materials arises from spin-exchange coupling between local moments and itinerant electrons, representing a challenging many-body open-quantum problem. Here we develop a comprehensive microscopic theory of MR within an open-quantum-system framework by solving the Liouville-von Neumann equation for a hybrid system of free electrons and local moments using the time-convolutionless projection operator method. Our approach reveals both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic MR as consequences of temperature- and field-dependent spin decoherence, encompassing spin relaxation and dephasing. In particular, the resistance associated with spin decoherence is governed by the order parameters of magnetic materials, such as the magnetization in ferromagnets and the N\'eel vector in antiferromagnets. This theory deepens the fundamental understanding of MR and offers guidance for interpreting and designing experiments on magnetic materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24586v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Evidence for the suppression of the hybrid skin-topological effect by fragile topology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00347</link><description>arXiv:2601.00347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological insulators are well-known for their topological edge states, which are protected by the non-trivial bulk topology and characterized by gapless Wannier bands, a phenomenon known as the bulk-boundary correspondence. However, fragile topology challenged this concept, the Wannier bands are gapped, but the edge states still exist with similar protection. Previous studies on fragile topology have primarily focused on the spectral flow under twisted boundary conditions, but the discussion on the physical interpretation of the Wannier gap is limited. In this study, we introduce a bilayer breathing honeycomb lattice with spiral interlayer couplings inside the unit cell. As we increase the interlayer coupling strength, the Wannier gap increases monotonically and the bandgap first increases then decreases. After introducing a gain-loss domain wall, the hybrid skin-topological effect (HSTE) emerges, and the topological edge states under the periodic boundary condition (PBC) change into corner states under the open boundary condition (OBC) associated with the significant spectral difference. HSTE is suppressed as the interlayer coupling strength increases, the spectral difference between the two boundary conditions has an overall decreasing trend, which more closely mirrors the evolution of the inverse of the Wannier gap. Moreover, some of the corner states transform into edge states. Our work first provides evidence for the relation between fragile topology and HSTE, shedding new insights into the underlying mechanism of Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE).</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00347v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Lindbladian versus Postselected Non-Hermitian Topology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07187</link><description>arXiv:2507.07187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent topological classification of non-Hermitian `Hamiltonians' is usually interpreted in terms of pure quantum states that decay or grow with time. However, many-body systems with loss and gain are typically better described by mixed-state open quantum dynamics, which only correspond to pure-state non-Hermitian dynamics upon a postselection of measurement outcomes. Since postselection becomes exponentially costly with particle number, we here investigate to what extent the most important example of non-Hermitian topology can survive without it: the non-Hermitian skin effect and its relationship to a bulk winding number in one spatial dimension. After defining the winding number of the Lindbladian superoperator for a quadratic fermion system, we systematically relate it to the winding number of the associated postselected non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We prove that the two winding numbers are equal (opposite) in the absence of gain (loss), and provide a physical explanation for this relationship. When both loss and gain are present, the Lindbladian winding number typically remains quantized and non-zero, though it can change sign at a phase transition separating the loss and gain-dominated regimes. This transition, which leads to a reversal of the Lindbladian skin effect localization, is rendered invisible by postselection. We also identify a case where removing postselection induces a skin effect from otherwise topologically trivial non-Hermitian dynamics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.07187v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Stochastic interpretation of quantum mechanics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06418</link><description>arXiv:2510.06418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We express the probabilistic character associated to the wave function by treating it as a stochastic variable. This is accomplished by means of a stochastic equation for the wave function whose noise changes the phase of the wave function but not its absolute value, so that the norm of the wave function is strictly conserved along a stochastic trajectory. We show that the density matrix that obeys the quantum Liouville equation is the covariance matrix associated to the stochastic wave function.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.06418v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Bare-Metal Tensor Virtualization: Overcoming the Memory Wall in Edge-AI Inference on ARM64</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03324</link><description>arXiv:2601.03324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is fundamentally constrained by the "Memory Wall" the bottleneck where data movement latency outstrips arithmetic throughput. Standard inference runtimes often incur significant overhead through high-level abstractions, dynamic dispatch, and unaligned memory access patterns. In this work, we present a novel "Virtual Tensor Core" architecture implemented in software, optimized specifically for ARM64 microarchitectures (Apple Silicon). By bypassing standard library containers in favor of direct memory mapping (mmap) and implementing hand-tuned NEON SIMD kernels, we achieve a form of "Software-Defined Direct Memory Access (DMA)." Our proposed Tensor Virtualization Layout (TVL) guarantees 100% cache line utilization for weight matrices, while our zero-copy loader eliminates initialization latency. Experimental results on a 110M parameter model demonstrate a stable throughput of &gt;60 tokens/second on M2 hardware. While proprietary hardware accelerators (e.g., Apple AMX) can achieve higher peak throughput, our architecture provides a fully open, portable, and deterministic reference implementation for studying the memory bottleneck on general-purpose ARM silicon, meeting the 200ms psycholinguistic latency threshold without opaque dependencies.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03324v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] GAP-LA: GPU-Accelerated Performance-Driven Layer Assignment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13375</link><description>arXiv:2507.13375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Layer assignment is critical for global routing of VLSI circuits. It converts 2D routing paths into 3D routing solutions by determining the proper metal layer for each routing segments to minimize congestion and via count. As different layers have different unit resistance and capacitance, layer assignment also has significant impacts to timing and power. With growing design complexity, it becomes increasingly challenging to simultaneously optimize timing, power, and congestion efficiently. Existing studies are mostly limited to a subset of objectives. In this paper, we propose a GPU-accelerated performance-driven layer assignment framework, GAP-LA, for holistic optimization the aforementioned objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that we can achieve 0.3%-9.9% better worst negative slack (WNS) and 2.0%-5.4% better total negative slack (TNS) while maintaining power and congestion with competitive runtime compared with ISPD 2025 contest winners, especially on designs with up to 12 millions of nets.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.13375v2</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Hybrid IEG–ISG Synthesis of Sequence-Defined Polymers via Orthogonal CuAAC and Acyl Azide Esterification</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-5ttnj?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Sequence-defined polymers demand synthetic strategies that deliver high sequence fidelity, structural complexity, and access to high–molar mass in a limited number of operations.

Classical CR provides model-dependent activation energies (Ea) and pre-exponential factors (A) from a single heating ramp but relies on a global straight-line fit of ln[g(α)/T2] versus 1/T, which does not provide a rigorous differential definition of Ea and averages over curvature, obscuring local kinetic information since 1964. In this study, we reformulate CR in a differential framework (d-CR) by recognizing that the rigorous activation energy is given by the local derivative of ln[g(α)/T2] versus 1/T. In the infinitesimal-window limit, the CR relation yields conversion-resolved kinetic triplets {Ea(α), A(α), dα/dt} along a single heating rate for any chosen solid-state model. This converts CR from a single {Ea, A} pair into a dense kinetic field that enables two internal consistency checks unavailable in the classical workflow: (i) point-by-point rate-parity tests between reconstructed and experimental rates and (ii) conversion-variant compensation analysis in the {Ea(α), ln A(α)} plane. We benchmark d-CR against classical CR on non-catalyzed and zeolite-catalyzed thermolysis of pristine low-density polyethylene (LDPE), quantifying the bias introduced by global CR linearization even at high R2 and embedding d-CR into the isoconversional model selection workflow. To test applicability beyond polymers and thermogravimetry under isoconversional-free conditions, we apply d-CR to dehydration of Na2HPO4 and temperature-programmed in-situ FT-IR at a single heating rate. The d-CR framework thus improves a long-standing integral linearization into a conversion-resolved, model-aware kinetic analysis that is directly applicable to existing temperature-programmed datasets beyond thermogravimetry.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-2wfh3-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Here, we investigate whether CTCF and cohesin co-binding on DNA imposes constraints on DNA replication, leading to DNA damage and genomic instability. Our results reveal that CTCF and cohesin remain co-bound to DNA during replication in cancer cells (HeLa). Furthermore, analysis of DNA damage response/repair (DDR) proteins — including MRE11, STN1, γH2AX, and RAD51 — showed a high enrichment of these proteins at CBSs, compared to immediate flanking regions.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00021-0?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] &lt;i&gt;Chlorella&lt;/i&gt;-derived extracellular vesicle-based nanogels suppress cGAS-STING for treatment of radiation-induced lung injury</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-68140-2</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 08 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-68140-2"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-025-68140-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI), a serious complication of radiation exposure, is associated with cGAS-STING pathway overactivation.

Despite its efficacy, systemic pilocarpine is limited by side effects, while existing local delivery methods (e.g., mouthwashes and sprays) are inconsistent in their efficacy. This study aimed to develop a novel localized delivery system—pilocarpine-loaded hyaluronic acid microneedles (PHMNs)—to overcome the limitations of previous topical approaches by enabling efficient intradermal drug delivery directly to the salivary gland region. The PHMNs, fabricated via a two-step molding process, exhibited robust mechanical strength (1.5 N per needle) for reliable skin penetration and rapid dissolution within 15 min &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;in vivo&lt;/span&gt;. In non-obese diabetic mice, a model of SS, the PHMNs stimulated salivary secretion to a level comparable with that achieved by systemic (intraperitoneal or oral) pilocarpine administration. Crucially, pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that the PHMN group maintained significantly lower systemic drug exposure (with no sharp peak and minimal blood concentrations at 30–60 min) than both systemic routes. Furthermore, mice treated with PHMNs for 10 days showed a sustained reduction in daily water intake, indicating effective alleviation of dry mouth symptoms. By combining the precision of intradermal delivery with the biocompatibility of hyaluronic acid, this PHMN system offers a promising, differentiated strategy for managing SS-related xerostomia, providing potent local efficacy while minimizing the risk of systemic side effects associated with conventional pilocarpine therapies.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Materials Current Issue</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apm/article/14/1/011104/3376929/Pilocarpine-loaded-hyaluronic-acid-microneedles</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Centrosomal P4.1-associated protein (CPAP) is a novel regulator of ESCRT pathway function during endosome maturation</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00034-9?rss=yes</link><description>Previously, we reported that Centrosomal P4.1-associated protein (CPAP/CENPJ/SAS-4) positively regulates multivesicular body (MVB) biogenesis and endocytic vesicular transport (EVT). Here, we show that CPAP is required for Rab5-to-Rab7 conversion, and recruitment of TSG101 to early endosome (EE) is the molecular mechanism by which CPAP promotes MVB formation. CPAP depletion disrupts Rab7 and TSG101 recruitment to EE and blocks endosome maturation. While endogenous CPAP co-precipitates with ESCRT-proteins TSG101, HRS and ALIX, exogenously expressed CPAP only interacts with TSG101.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026

Abstract: The synthesis of nanocrystals has been highly dependent on trial-and-error, due to the complex correlation between synthesis parameters and physicochemical properties. Although deep learning offers a potential methodology to achieve generative inverse design, it is still hindered by the scarcity of high-quality datasets that align nanocrystal synthesis routes with their properties. Here, we present the construction of a large-scale, aligned Nanocrystal Synthesis-Property (NSP) database and demonstrate its capability for generative inverse design. To extract structured synthesis routes and their corresponding product properties from literature, we develop NanoExtractor, a large language model (LLM) enhanced by well-designed augmentation strategies. NanoExtractor is validated against human experts, achieving a weighted average score of 88% on the test set, significantly outperforming chemistry-specialized (3%) and general-purpose LLMs (38%). The resulting NSP database contains nearly 160,000 aligned entries and serves as training data for our NanoDesigner, an LLM for inverse synthesis design. The generative capability of NanoDesigner is validated through the successful design of viable synthesis routes for both well-established PbSe nanocrystals and rarely reported MgF2 nanocrystals. Notably, the model recommends a counter-intuitive, non-stoichiometric precursor ratio (1:1) for MgF2 nanocrystals, which is experimentally confirmed as critical for suppressing byproducts. Our work bridges the gap between unstructured literature and data-driven synthesis, and also establishes a powerful human-AI collaborative paradigm for accelerating nanocrystal discovery.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02424v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Protein-Water Energy Transfer via Anharmonic Low-Frequency Vibrations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02699</link><description>arXiv:2601.02699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat dissipation is ubiquitous in living systems, which constantly convert distinct forms of energy into each other. The transport of thermal energy in liquids and even within proteins is well understood but kinetic energy transfer across a heterogeneous molecular boundary provides additional challenges. Here, we use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations under steady-state conditions to analyze how a protein dissipates surplus thermal energy into the surrounding solvent. We specifically focus on collective degrees of freedom that govern the dynamics of the system from the diffusive regime to mid-infrared frequencies. Using a fully anharmonic analysis of molecular vibrations, we analyzed their vibrational spectra, temperatures, and heat transport efficiencies. We find that the most efficient energy transfer mechanisms are associated with solvent-mediated friction. However, this mechanism only applies to a small number of degrees of freedom of a protein. Instead, less efficient vibrational energy transfer in the far-infrared dominates heat transfer overall due to a large number of vibrations in this frequency range. A notable by-product of this work is a highly sensitive measure of deviations from energy equi-partition in equilibrium systems, which can be used to analyze non-ergodic properties.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02699v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interplay of Structure and Dynamics in Solid Polymer Electrolytes: a Molecular Dynamics Study of LiPF6/polypropylene carbonate</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02869</link><description>arXiv:2601.02869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state batteries (SSB) are emerging as next-generation electrochemical energy storage devices. Achieving high energy density in SSB relies on solid polymer electrolytes (SPE) that are electrochemically stable against both lithium metal and high-potential positive electrodes, two conditions that are difficult to satisfy without chemical degradation. In this work, molecular dynamics simulations are employed to investigate the relationship between structure and dynamics in carbonate-based SPE composed of polypropylene carbonate and lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF$_6$), at salt concentrations ranging from 0.32 to 1.21 mol$/$kg. Structural properties are analyzed under ambient pressure at the experimentally relevant temperature $T = 353$ K. Since the slow dynamical processes governing ion transport in these systems are inaccessible to direct molecular dynamics, transport properties are simulated at elevated temperatures up to 900 K and extrapolated to $T = 353$ K using Arrhenius behavior. The results reveal strong ionic correlations, a limited fraction of free ions, and a predominance of negatively charged clusters, especially at high salt concentration. At high temperature, the self-diffusion coefficient of Li$^+$ exceeds that of PF$_6^-$ due to weaker Li$^+$-carbonate and ion-ion interactions. However, at $T = 353$ K, Li$^+$ mobility becomes lower than that of the anion, consistent with typical experimental observations in SPE. As expected, the ionic conductivity $\sigma$ increases with temperature, while at $T = 353$ K it exhibits a maximum for salt concentrations between 1.0 and 1.1 mol$/$kg. Overall, the estimated physico-chemical parameters highlight the key role of ion correlations in SPE and suggest strategies to optimize electrolyte performance. The Arrhenius extrapolation approach used here provides valuable insight into ion transport mechanisms in solid polymer electrolytes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02869v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] DeepH-pack: A general-purpose neural network package for deep-learning electronic structure calculations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02938</link><description>arXiv:2601.02938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In computational physics and materials science, first-principles methods, particularly density functional theory, have become central tools for electronic structure prediction and materials design. Recently, rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have begun to reshape the research landscape, giving rise to the emerging field of deep-learning electronic structure calculations. Despite numerous pioneering studies, the field remains in its early stages; existing software implementations are often fragmented, lacking unified frameworks and standardized interfaces required for broad community adoption. Here we present DeepH-pack, a comprehensive and unified software package that integrates first-principles calculations with deep learning. By incorporating fundamental physical principles into neural-network design, such as the nearsightedness principle and the equivariance principle, DeepH-pack achieves robust cross-scale and cross-material generalizability. This allows models trained on small-scale structures to generalize to large-scale and previously unseen materials. The toolkit preserves first-principles accuracy while accelerating electronic structure calculations by several orders of magnitude, establishing an efficient and intelligent computational paradigm for large-scale materials simulation, high-throughput materials database construction, and AI-driven materials discovery.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02938v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Novel fast Li-ion conductors for solid-state electrolytes from first-principles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03151</link><description>arXiv:2601.03151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a high-throughput computational screening for fast lithium-ion conductors to identify promising materials for application in all solid-state electrolytes. Starting from more than 30,000 Li-containing experimental structures sourced from Crystallography Open Database, Inorganic Crystal Structure Database and Materials Platform for Data Science, we perform highly automated calculations to identify electronic insulators. On these ~1000 structures, we use molecular dynamics simulations to estimate Li-ion diffusivities using the pinball model, which describes the potential energy landscape of diffusing lithium with accuracy similar to density functional theory while being 200-500 times faster. Then we study the ~60 most promising and previously unknown fast conductors with full first-principles molecular dynamics simulations at several temperatures to estimate their activation barriers. The results are discussed in detail for the 9 fastest conductors, including $Li_7NbO_6$ which shows a remarkable ionic conductivity of ~5 mS/cm at room temperature. We further present the entire screening protocol, including the workflows where the accuracy of the pinball model is improved self-consistently, necessary to automatically running the required calculations and analysing their results.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03151v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Kinetic Flux Equations for Ion Exchange in Silicate Glasses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03207</link><description>arXiv:2601.03207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion exchange kinetic flux equations have been extensively investigated since the mid-twentieth century and continue to provide a fundamental framework for describing mass transport phenomena in solid materials. Despite the maturity of this field, inconsistencies remain in the literature concerning the definition, dimensional consistency, and physical interpretation of the parameters involved. A rigorous and unified treatment of these equations is therefore essential to ensure the reproducibility and comparability of theoretical and experimental studies. The present study aims to establish a coherent and systematic development of ion exchange kinetic flux equations, with particular emphasis on the consistent definition and dimensional formulation of the relevant physical quantities. Beyond refining the theoretical foundations, this study extends the classical formulation by incorporating the influence of mechanical stress on ion transport and considering cross-term interactions within the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics. These developments provide a more comprehensive description of ion exchange kinetics, particularly as applied to silicate glasses, where coupling between chemical and mechanical effects plays a crucial role in determining transport behavior and performance.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03207v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine Learning H-theorem</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14003</link><description>arXiv:2508.14003v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: H-theorem provides a microscopic foundation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics and is therefore essential to establishing statistical physics, but at the same time, H-theorem has been subject to controversy that in part persists till this day. To better understand H-theorem and its relation to the arrow of time, we study the equilibration of randomly oriented and positioned hard disks with periodic boundary conditions. Using a model based on the DeepSets architecture, which imposes permutation invariance of the particle labels, we train a model to capture the irreversibility of the H-functional.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.14003v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Bloch oscillations of helicoidal spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in deep optical lattices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14873</link><description>arXiv:2509.14873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider helicoidal spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in deep optical lattice and study the dynamics of Bloch oscillation. We show that the variation of helicoidal gauge potential with spin-orbit coupling is different in zero-momentum and plane-wave phases. The characteristics of Bloch oscillation are different in the two phases. In the zero-momentum phase, the Bloch oscillation is harmonic while it is anharmonic in the plane-wave phase. The amplitude of Bloch oscillation is found to be affected by the helicoidal gauge potential and spin-orbit coupling. We examine that the decay of Bloch oscillation caused by mean-field interaction can be managed by helicoidal spin-orbit coupling.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.14873v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Tuning Separator Chemistry: Improving Zn Anode Compatibility via Functionalized Chitin Nanofibers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19449</link><description>arXiv:2512.19449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aqueous zinc (Zn) batteries (AZBs) face significant challenges due to the limited compatibility of Zn anodes with conventional separators, leading to dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and poor cycling stability. While separator design is crucial for optimizing battery performance, its potential remains underexplored. The commonly used glass fiber (GF) filters were not originally designed as battery separators. To address their limitations, nanochitin derived from waste shrimp shells was used to fabricate separators with varying concentrations of amine and carboxylic functional groups. This study investigates how the type and concentration of these groups influence the separator's properties and performance. In a mild acidic electrolyte that protonates the amine groups, the results showed that the density of both ammonium and carboxylic groups in the separators significantly affected water structure and ionic conductivity. Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering (QENS) revealed that low-functionalized chitin, particularly with only ammonium groups, promotes strongly bound water with restricted mobility, thereby enhancing Zn plating and stripping kinetics. These separators exhibit exceptional Zn stability over 2000 hours at low current densities (0.5 mA/cm2), maintaining low overpotentials and stable polarization. Additionally, the full cell consisting of Zn||NaV3O8.1.5H2O showed a cycle life of over 2000 cycles at 2 A/g, demonstrating the compatibility of the nanochitin-based separators with low concentrations of functional surface groups. These results demonstrate the importance of a simple separator design for improving the overall performance of AZBs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.19449v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Unsupervised Topological Phase Discovery in Periodically Driven Systems via Floquet-Bloch State</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24822</link><description>arXiv:2512.24822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Floquet engineering offers an unparalleled platform for realizing novel non-equilibrium topological phases. However, the unique structure of Floquet systems, which includes multiple quasienergy gaps, poses a significant challenge to classification using conventional analytical methods. We propose a novel unsupervised machine learning framework that employs a kernel defined in momentum-time ($\boldsymbol{k},t$) space, constructed directly from Floquet-Bloch eigenstates. This approach is intrinsically data-driven and requires no prior knowledge of the underlying topological invariants, providing a fundamental advantage over prior methods that rely on abstract concepts like the micromotion operator or homotopic transformations. Crucially, this work successfully reveals the intrinsic topological characteristics encoded within the Floquet eigenstates themselves. We demonstrate that our method robustly and simultaneously identifies the topological invariants associated with both the $0$-gap and the $\pi$-gap across various symmetry classes (1D AIII, 1D D, and 2D A), establishing a robust methodology for the systematic classification and discovery of complex non-equilibrium topological matter.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24822v2</guid></item><item><title>[Chinese Chemical Society: CCS Chemistry: Table of Contents] Accelerated Bidirectional Photochromism via Excited Bridge</title><link>https://ccs-stag.literatumonline.com/doi/abs/10.31635/ccschem.025.202506871?af=R</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.chinesechemsoc.org/cms/asset/53b39377-fc92-420e-884a-d0c623a09a7c/keyimage.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;CCS Chemistry, Ahead of Print.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI:10.31635/ccschem.025.202506871&lt;/div&gt;The bridge connecting the electron donor and acceptor is crucial for electron transfer (ET).

We report the outcomes and key insights from an open science community blind challenge focused on computational methods in drug discovery, using lead optimization data from the AI-driven Structure-enabled Antiviral Platform (ASAP) Discovery Consortium’s pan-coronavirus antiviral discovery program, in partnership with Polaris and the OpenADMET project. This collaborative initiative invited global participants from both academia and industry to develop and apply computational methods to predict the biochemical potency and crystallographic ligand poses of small molecules against key coronavirus targets, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) main protease (Mpro), as well as multiple ADMET assay endpoints, using previously undisclosed comprehensive experimental drug discovery datasets as benchmarks. By evaluating submissions across multiple tasks and compounds, we established performance leaderboards and conducted meta-analyses to assess methodological strengths, common pitfalls, and areas for improvement. This analysis provides a foundation for best practices in real-world machine learning evaluation, grounded in community-driven benchmarking. We also highlight how next-generation platforms, such as Polaris, enable rigorous challenge design, embedded evaluation frameworks, and broad community engagement.

However, quantitative EXAFS interpretation still relies on manually constructed structural models and extensive parameter tuning, creating a growing bottleneck as experimental datasets increase in size and complexity. Addressing this bottleneck requires a direct and systematic mapping between atomic structure and EXAFS response. Here we introduce AI-EXAFS, a physics-informed graph neural network that predicts full EXAFS spectra directly from three-dimensional atomic coordinates. By formulating the learning problem around the physical principles governing EXAFS signal formation, the model learns transferable structure–spectrum relationships and eliminates the need for user-defined parameter selection at inference. Trained on 86,000 transition-metal complexes, AI-EXAFS reproduces reference theoretical spectra with accuracy consistent with established EXAFS analysis practice and generalizes to experimentally relevant systems, including platinum single-atom catalysts. AI-EXAFS provides an accurate and readily deployable forward model for EXAFS, enabling standardized first-pass structural screening and offering a scalable foundation for future extensions toward more realistic and data-rich EXAFS analysis.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-sv3f6?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Defined by Shape: Elucidating the Molecular Recognition of Dynamic Loops with Covalent Ligands</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-qwc85?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Protein loops harness conformational heterogeneity to perform an array of functions, ranging from catalyzing enzymatic reactions to communicating allosteric signals. Although attractive targets for small molecule modulation, these functional hubs are often considered unligandable due to their lack of well-defined binding pockets and highly dynamic structure. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated the power of covalent chemistry to selectively capture cryptic pockets formed by protein loops. Herein, we leverage machine learning to elucidate the molecular basis of covalent ligand:loop recognition in the transcriptional coactivator Med25. Key to our success was classification by ligand shape prior to model training, which led to descriptive and predictive models. The models were experimentally validated through the synthesis and in vitro testing of novel top-ranked ligands, revealing canonical structure-affinity relationships, including an activity cliff. Further feature analyses identified traditional topological and spatial parameters predictive of binding, and molecular modeling uncovered a potential binding pocket with at least two distinct conformations with high shape complementarity. Collectively, these findings reveal the hidden potential of dynamic loops as specific sites for covalent small molecule modulation, challenging the notion that protein loops are unligandable and demonstrating their capacity for exquisite, shape-based molecular recognition.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-qwc85?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] QuantumPDB: A Workflow for High-Throughput Quantum Cluster Model Generation from Protein Structures</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-w5x1d?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Computational modeling of enzymes provides molecular-level insight into catalysis, but the preparation of quantum mechanical (QM) calculations starting from experimental structures is a significant bottleneck for high-throughput studies. Automated tools developed to accelerate this process may fail to generalize across distinct active site chemistries and geometries. To overcome these limitations, we present QuantumPDB, a Python package that automates the generation of hierarchical coordination/interaction spheres around an active center to create QM cluster models directly from raw protein structures. The workflow integrates structure cleaning, protonation state assignment, and QM calculation setup. It uses chemically meaningful models constructed from contact-based interaction spheres derived from Voronoi tessellation, enabling accurate representation of complex active site geometries. We provide an overview of our modular code and describe how it may be employed to automate high-throughput protein screening. To demonstrate its utility, we curated a dataset of 989 holo-enzymes from the PDB and performed QM calculations on 1,673 enzyme cluster models of 842 of these enzymes. Analysis of computed properties suggests that enzyme environments simulated with density functional theory consistently modulate substrate charge toward neutrality and reduce the substrate dipole moment. This phenomenon appears to be general, even in cases where the active site consists predominantly of neutral residues. By automating and standardizing multi-sphere QM model construction, QuantumPDB provides a robust platform for large-scale, data-driven investigations of proteins.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-w5x1d?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Generalization and Usability of Co-Folded GPCR–Ligand Complexes: A Physics-Guided Assessment</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-1rkqz?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Deep learning co-folding models for end-to-end protein–ligand structure prediction mark a major advance beyond AlphaFold2, yet their reliability for decision-making in drug discovery remains unclear. Here, we benchmark Boltz, a state-of-the-art co-folding model, using a curated set of ligand-bound human G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) from families unseen during training. We find that the receptor backbones are generally predicted with reasonable accuracy, but ligand poses often deviate significantly from experimental structures. We then evaluate physics-based refinement with rigid-receptor (Glide) and induced-fit docking (IFD-MD) methods, which recover more than half of the misplaced ligands to near-experimental accuracy. As conventional evaluations for co-folded structures focus on distance-based metrics such as root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD), which can miss subtle but consequential binding-site errors, we carry out a further assessment of Boltz performance using free-energy perturbation (FEP+), which is both accurate and sensitive to starting-structure quality, on curated congeneric ligand series with known binding affinities that target the GPCRs. A significant fraction of the 14 congeneric series tested in this fashion fail to reproduce experimental binding affinities via FEP+ when employing the Boltz generated complex, even when the binding-site RMSD is low in some cases. IFD-MD rescues these failures and restores retrospective FEP signals to native-like level for all of these series. Together, these results delineate current generalization and usability limits of co-folded GPCR–ligand complexes and motivate a workflow that pairs deep learning predictions with physics-based refinement and validation before high-stakes decisions in drug discovery.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-1rkqz?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Communications Physics] Interpolation-based coordinate descent method for parameterized quantum circuits</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-025-02473-8</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Communications Physics, Published online: 07 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-025-02473-8"&gt;doi:10.1038/s42005-025-02473-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Parameterized quantum circuits are a common tool in variational quantum algorithms and quantum machine learning.

We present ConfDENSE, a Set2Set enhanced PointNet model that learns directly from Hirshfeld promolecule electron-density point clouds, preserving full 3D electronic in- formation without downsampling.Despite using no receptor structural data, ConfDENSE accurately identifies bioac- tive conformers from ensemble inputs. For the only available human odorant receptor structures, the model’s selected conformers achieve sub-angstrom RMSDs to crystallo- graphic ligand poses and frequently outperform conventional docking. Combining ConfDENSE with explainability analysis further reveals the substruc- tures most responsible for receptor engagement, aligning with experimental interaction patterns. This ligand-centric and interpretable framework naturally supports phar- macophore extraction and scaffold-based design, enabling identification of conserved binding motifs even when receptor structures are missing. ConfDENSE thus provides a compact, physics-aware approach to computational olfaction, linking electron density, conformational preference, and odorant recognition in a structurally agnostic manner.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-8tmtg?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[AI for Science - latest papers] MOSES: combining automated ontology construction with a multi-agent system for explainable chemical knowledge reasoning</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae3127</link><description>The vast and multiscale nature of chemical knowledge—from molecular structures to material properties—presents significant challenges for both human researchers and artificial intelligence (AI) systems. While large language models (LLMs) can process chemical information, they operate as black boxes without transparent reasoning. Here, we present our multi-agent ontology system for explainable knowledge synthesis (MOSES), a framework that combines automated knowledge organization with multi-agent collaboration to create an AI system for interpretable chemical knowledge reasoning. Using supramolecular chemistry as a testbed, we automatically constructed an ontology of over 10 000 classes from 52 publications and developed a multi-agent system that enables transparent knowledge retrieval and reasoning. Evaluations by human experts and LLMs show that MOSES significantly outperforms chemistry-oriented LLMs and leading general-purpose LLMs—including GPT-4.1 and o3—as well as GraphRAG-augmented GPT-4.1 models, on complex chemical questions, achieving superior scores in both direct assessments and Elo ratings. MOSES’s traceable reasoning paths reveal how it constructs answers through iterative refinement rather than probabilistic generation. However, we observe an asymmetry in handling positive versus negative knowledge claims, underscoring fundamental challenges in open-world reasoning. Our work demonstrates a pathway toward AI systems that can reason over complex scientific knowledge in a transparent and explainable manner.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae3127</guid></item><item><title>[Cell Reports Physical Science] A review of advancements and challenges in nanoplastics detection</title><link>https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-physical-science/fulltext/S2666-3864(25)00641-1?rss=yes</link><description>Zhang et al. review cutting-edge strategies for separating, detecting, and characterizing nanoplastics across environmental and biological systems.

However, low mechanical strength of carbon matrix is incapable of maintaining structural stability and electron/ion conductivity of Si anodes. Herein, we employ electrospinning-carbonization to construct free-standing Si@carbon nanofibers with internal ordered channels, uniformly distributed Si nanoparticles, and extraordinary elastic modulus (0.22 GPa) by introducing polystyrene as an oriented filler. The free-standing and rigid-flexible ordered multichannel carbon nanofibers (OM-CNFs) can absorb the volume variation of Si, effectively enhancing the mechanical strength and chemical stability of electrodes. The Si nanoparticles uniformly embedded into the highly conductive OM-CNFs matrix establish a bicontinuous structure and increase the contact area between Si and CNFs, thus boosting the rate capability. Consequently, the Si@OM-CNFs anode delivers an excellent reversible capacity of 939.9 mA h g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; even at 5 A g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; after 300 cycles.

Existing animal models fail to capture key clinical and biological features of this condition. Here, we established a panel of patient-derived organoid xenograft (PDOX) models that authentically replicate the heterogeneity of ESCC-associated cachexia in immunodeficient mice. PDOX lines exhibited slow tumor growth comparing to traditional ESCC xenografts. Heterogeneous cachexia phenotypes in PDOX-bearing mice as compared to non-tumor-bearing mice, including body weight loss, reduction in adipose tissue, reduced grip strength, and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines, were observed.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00013-1?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Public Support for Mobile Community Microgrids: Socioeconomic, Perceptual and Outage Experience Determinants of Energy Resilience</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00012-X?rss=yes</link><description>As climate-induced disasters increasingly compromise electric grid reliability, Mobile Community Microgrids (MCMs) have emerged as a promising strategy to strengthen local energy resilience. This study examines the socioeconomic and perceptual determinants of public MCM acceptance using a nationally representative survey of 1,996 U.S. residents. Hierarchical regression results indicate that the desire for improved power reliability is the strongest predictor of acceptance, followed by expectations of faster disaster response and lower energy costs.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00012-X?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Leveraging health records to identify diagnoses associated with recurrent pregnancy loss across two medical centers</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00008-8?rss=yes</link><description>Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), defined as 2 or more pregnancy losses, affects 5-6% of ever-pregnant individuals. Approximately half of these cases have no identifiable explanation. In this study, we aim to identify diagnoses associated with RPL and generate hypotheses about RPL etiology utilizing electronic health record (EHR) data. We implemented a case-control study comparing the history of over 1,600 diagnoses between RPL and live birth patients, leveraging the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) and Stanford University EHR databases.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00008-8?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[Matter] Unlocking hidden battery mechanistic insights: A novel mechano-electrochemical impedance spectroscopy approach</title><link>https://www.cell.com/matter/fulltext/S2590-2385(25)00646-0?rss=yes</link><description>Mechano-electrochemical signals are vital for battery diagnostics but have lacked direct interpretability for chemical experts.

Abstract: Physical properties and functionalities of materials are dictated by global crystal structures as well as local defects. To establish a structure-property relationship, not only the crystallographic symmetry but also quantitative knowledge about defects are required. Here we present a hybrid Machine Learning framework that integrates a physically-constrained variational-autoencoder (pcVAE) with different Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods to systematically accelerate and improve crystal structure refinement with resolution of defects. We chose the pyrochlore structured Ho2Ti2O7 as a model system and employed the GSAS2 package for benchmarking crystallographic parameters from Rietveld refinement. However, the function space of these material systems is highly nonlinear, which limits optimizers like traditional Rietveld refinement, into trapping at local minima. Also, these naive methods don't provide an extensive learning about the overall function space, which is essential for large space, large time consuming explorations to identify various potential regions of interest. Thus, we present the approach of exploring the high Dimensional structure parameters of defect sensitive systems via pretrained pcVAE assisted BO and Sparse Axis Aligned BO. The pcVAE projects high-Dimensional diffraction data consisting of thousands of independently measured diffraction orders into a lowD latent space while enforcing scaling invariance and physical relevance. Then via BO methods, we aim to minimize the L2 norm based chisq errors in the real and latent spaces separately between experimental and simulated diffraction patterns, thereby steering the refinement towards potential optimum crystal structure parameters. We investigated and compared the results among different pcVAE assisted BO, non pcVAE assisted BO, and Rietveld refinement.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00855v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A Chemically Grounded Evaluation Framework for Generative Models in Materials Discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00886</link><description>arXiv:2601.00886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models hold great promise for accelerating materials discovery, but their evaluation often overlooks the chemical validity and stability requirements crucial to real-world applications. Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations are the gold standard for evaluating such properties but are computationally intensive and inaccessible to non-experts. We propose a chemically grounded, user-friendly evaluation framework that integrates DFT-based stability analysis with commonly used machine learning (ML) metrics. Through systematic experiments using both perturbative and generative methods, we demonstrate that conventional ML metrics can misrepresent chemical feasibility. To address this, we propose new insights on robust metrics and highlight the importance of simulation-informed evaluation for developing reliable generative models in materials science.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00886v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Disordered Dynamics in High Dimensions: Connections to Random Matrices and Machine Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01010</link><description>arXiv:2601.01010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an overview of high dimensional dynamical systems driven by random matrices, focusing on applications to simple models of learning and generalization in machine learning theory. Using both cavity method arguments and path integrals, we review how the behavior of a coupled infinite dimensional system can be characterized as a stochastic process for each single site of the system. We provide a pedagogical treatment of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), a framework that can be flexibly applied to these settings. The DMFT single site stochastic process is fully characterized by a set of (two-time) correlation and response functions. For linear time-invariant systems, we illustrate connections between random matrix resolvents and the DMFT response. We demonstrate applications of these ideas to machine learning models such as gradient flow, stochastic gradient descent on random feature models and deep linear networks in the feature learning regime trained on random data. We demonstrate how bias and variance decompositions (analysis of ensembling/bagging etc) can be computed by averaging over subsets of the DMFT noise variables. From our formalism we also investigate how linear systems driven with random non-Hermitian matrices (such as random feature models) can exhibit non-monotonic loss curves with training time, while Hermitian matrices with the matching spectra do not, highlighting a different mechanism for non-monotonicity than small eigenvalues causing instability to label noise. Lastly, we provide asymptotic descriptions of the training and test loss dynamics for randomly initialized deep linear neural networks trained in the feature learning regime with high-dimensional random data. In this case, the time translation invariance structure is lost and the hidden layer weights are characterized as spiked random matrices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01010v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Predicting Coherent B2 Stability in Ru-Containing Refractory Alloys Through Thermodynamic Elastic Design Maps</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01326</link><description>arXiv:2601.01326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ruthenium-based B2 intermetallics are promising for refractory superalloys but are limited by the trade-off between high thermodynamic stability and elastic precipitation strain. We present a physics-guided machine learning framework integrating high-throughput Density Functional Theory (DFT), Random Forest screening, and Symbolic Regression to navigate this design space. This approach resolves the paradox where stoichiometric compounds like RuHf fail to achieve theoretical solvus temperatures. By deriving a closed-form physical law, we quantify the strain penalty: a 1% lattice misfit reduces the solvus temperature by approximately 200 degrees C. This finding confirms that maximizing thermodynamic driving force alone is insufficient. We demonstrate that multi-component alloying is structurally necessary, identifying ternary additions such as Al and Ti as essential lattice-tuning agents that zero out the elastic penalty. This framework establishes a rigorous, constraint-based protocol for alloy design, enabling the precise engineering of zero-misfit, high-stability microstructures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01326v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Common sublattice-pure van Hove singularities in the kagome superconductors $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($\textit{A}$ = K, Rb, Cs)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01428</link><description>arXiv:2601.01428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome materials offer a versatile platform for exploring correlated and topological quantum states, where van Hove singularities (VHSs) play a pivotal role in driving electronic instabilities, exhibiting distinct behaviors depending on electron filling and interaction settings. In the recently discovered kagome superconductors $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($\textit{A}$ = K, Rb, Cs), unconventional charge density wave order, superconductivity, and electronic chirality emerge, yet the nature of VHSs near the Fermi level ($\textit{E}$$_{F}$) and their connection to these exotic orders remain elusive. Here, using high-resolution polarization-dependent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we uncover a universal electronic structure across $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ that is distinct from density-functional theory predictions that show noticeable discrepancies. We identify multiple common sublattice-pure VHSs near $\textit{E}$$_{F}$, arising from strong V-$\textit{d}$/Sb-$\textit{p}$ hybridization, which significantly promote bond-order fluctuations and likely drive the observed charge density wave order. These findings provide direct spectroscopic evidence for hybridization-driven VHS formation in kagome metals and establish a unified framework for understanding the intertwined electronic instabilities in $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01428v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A Universal Model for the Resting Potential in Nanofluidic Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01536</link><description>arXiv:2601.01536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resting voltage, $V$, which is the potential drop required to nullify the electrical current ($i=0$), is a key characteristic of water desalination and energy harvesting systems that utilize macroscopically large nanoporous membranes, as well as for physiological ion channels subjected to asymmetric salt concentrations. To date, existing analytical expressions for $V_{i=0}$ have been limited to simple scenarios. In this work, we derive a universal, self-consistent theoretical model, devoid of unnecessary oversimplifying assumptions, that unifies all previous models within a single framework. This new model, verified by non-approximated numerical simulations, predicts the behavior of $V_{i=0}$ for arbitrary concentration gradients and for arbitrary diffusion coefficients and ionic valences. We show how the interplay between diffusion coefficients and ionic valencies significantly varies the system response and why it is essential to account for all system parameters. Ultimately, this model can be used to improve experimental interpretation of ion transport measurements.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01536v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Anharmonic lattice dynamics study of phonon transport in layered and molecular-crystal indium iodides</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01766</link><description>arXiv:2601.01766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indium iodides, which adopt layered or molecular-crystal-like arrangements depending on composition, are expected to exhibit low lattice thermal conductivity because of their heavy constituent atoms and weak In-I bonding. In this work, we employed first-principles anharmonic lattice dynamics calculations to systematically investigate phonon transport in indium iodides from particle- and wave-like perspectives. The calculated lattice thermal conductivities of both materials remained below 1 W/m-K over a broad temperature range. Notably, the influence of wave-like phonon transport differed by composition: in InI3, the wave-like contribution became comparable to the particle-like Peierls contribution, whereas it remained negligible in InI. We also investigated the thermal transport properties of the experimentally reported high-pressure phase of InI3. Motivated by experimental indications of stacking faults and partial disorder in indium site occupancy within the rhombohedral phase, we constructed several ordered structural models with different stacking sequences. These stacking sequences exhibited no significant energetic preference and had similar lattice thermal conductivities, suggesting that in-plane thermal transport is largely governed by the vibrational properties of the In2I6 layers themselves rather than by the specific stacking sequence. These findings provide insight into phonon transport in layered and molecular-crystal systems with structural complexity and contribute to a broader understanding of thermal transport mechanisms in layered and molecular-crystal-like materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01766v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spin-correlation Driven Ferroelectric Quantum Criticality in a Perovskite Quantum Spin-liquid System, Ba3CuSb2O9</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01906</link><description>arXiv:2601.01906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we have experimentally demonstrated spin-correlation-driven ferroelectric quantum criticality in a prototype quantum spin-liquid system, Ba3CuSb2O9, a quantum phenomenon rarely observed. The dielectric constant follows a clear T2 scaling, showing that the material behaves as a quantum paraelectric without developing ferroelectric order. Magnetically, the system avoids long-range order down to 1.8 K and instead displays a T3/2 dependence in its inverse susceptibility, a hallmark of antiferromagnetic quantum critical fluctuations. Together with known spin-orbital-lattice entanglement in this compound, these signatures point to a strong interplay between spin dynamics and the polar lattice. Our results place this perovskite spin-liquid family at the forefront of this domain and suggest the flexibility of this family in a suitable environment by tuning chemical/ external pressure.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01906v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Score-based diffusion models for accurate crystal-structure inpainting and reconstruction of hydrogen positions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01959</link><description>arXiv:2601.01959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI models, such as score-based diffusion models, have recently advanced the field of computational materials science by enabling the generation of new materials with desired properties. In addition, these models could also be leveraged to reconstruct crystal structures for which partial information is available. One relevant example is the reliable determination of atomic positions occupied by hydrogen atoms in hydrogen-containing crystalline materials. While crucial to the analysis and prediction of many materials properties, the identification of hydrogen positions can however be difficult and expensive, as it is challenging in X-ray scattering experiments and often requires dedicated neutron scattering measurements. As a consequence, inorganic crystallographic databases frequently report lattice structures where hydrogen atoms have been either omitted or inserted with heuristics or by chemical intuition. Here, we combine diffusion models from the field of materials science with techniques originally developed in computer vision for image inpainting. We present how this knowledge transfer across domains enables a much faster and more accurate completion of host structures, compared to unconditioned diffusion models or previous approaches solely based on DFT. Overall, our approach exceeds a success rate of 97% in terms of finding a structural match or predicting a more stable configuration than the initial reference, when starting both from structures that were already relaxed with DFT, or directly from the experimentally determined host structures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01959v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] New RVE concept and FFT methods in micromechanics of composites subjected to body force with compact support</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00822</link><description>arXiv:2601.00822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider static linear elastic composite materials (CMs) with periodic structure. The core of the proposed methodology is the generation of a novel dataset using specially designed body force fields with compact support (BFCS), enabling a new RVE concept that reduces the infinite periodic medium to a finite domain without boundary artifacts. This functionally reduced RVE is used for translated averaging of direct numerical simulations (DNS) results, efficiently computed via a newly developed FFT-based solver for BFCS loading. The resulting dataset captures localized field responses and is used to train machine learning (ML) and neural networks (NN) models to learn effective nonlocal surrogate operators. These operators accurately predict macroscopic responses while reflecting microstructural features and nonlocal interactions. By accounting for field localization while simultaneously eliminating influences from finite sample size and boundary effects, it provides a physically grounded and data-driven framework for constructing accurate surrogate models for the homogenization of complex materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00822v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] AutoPot: Automated and massively parallelized construction of Machine-Learning Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01185</link><description>arXiv:2601.01185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-learning potentials (MLIPs) have been a breakthrough for computational physics in bringing the accuracy of quantum mechanics to atomistic modeling. To achieve near-quantum accuracy, it is necessary that neighborhoods contained in the training set are rather close to the ones encountered during a simulation. Yet, constructing a single training set that works well for all applications is, and likely will remain, infeasible, so, one strategy is to supplement training protocols for MLIPs with additional learning methods, such as active learning, or fine-tuning. This strategy, however, yields very complex training protocols that are difficult to implement efficiently, and cumbersome to interpret, analyze, and reproduce.
  To address the above difficulties, we propose AutoPot, a software for automating the construction and archiving of MLIPs. AutoPot is based on BlackDynamite, a software operating parametric tasks, e.g., running simulations, or single-point ab initio calculations, in a highly-parallelized fashion, and Motoko, an event-based workflow manager for orchestrating interactions between the tasks. The initial version of AutoPot supports selection of training configurations from large training candidate sets, and on-the-fly selection from molecular dynamics simulations, using Moment Tensor Potentials as implemented in MLIP-2, and single-point calculations of the selected training configurations using VASP. Another strength of AutoPot is its flexibility: BlackDynamite tasks and orchestrators are Python functions to which own existing code can be easily added and manipulated without writing complex parsers. Therefore, it will be straightforward to add other MLIP and ab initio codes, and manipulate the Motoko orchestrators to implement other training protocols.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01185v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum Extreme Reservoir Computing for Phase Classification of Polymer Alloy Microstructures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02150</link><description>arXiv:2601.02150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is expected to offer new opportunities to process high-dimensional data efficiently by exploiting the exponentially large state space of quantum systems. In this work, we apply quantum extreme reservoir computing (QERC) to the classification of microstructure images of polymer alloys generated using self-consistent field theory (SCFT). While previous QML efforts have primarily focused on benchmark datasets such as MNIST, our work demonstrates the applicability of QERC to engineering data with direct materials relevance. Through numerical experiments, we examine the influence of key computational parameters-including the number of qubits, sampling cost (the number of measurement shots), and reservoir configuration-on classification performance. The resulting phase classifications are depicted as phase diagrams that illustrate the phase transitions in polymer morphology, establishing an understandable connection between quantum model outputs and material behavior. These results illustrate QERC performance on realistic materials datasets and suggest practical guidelines for quantum encoder design and model generalization. This work establishes a foundation for integrating quantum learning techniques into materials informatics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02150v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Projected branes as platforms for crystalline, superconducting, and higher-order topological phases</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23783</link><description>arXiv:2507.23783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Projected branes are constituted by only a small subset of sites of a higher-dimensional crystal, otherwise placed on a hyperplane oriented at an irrational or a rational slope therein, for which the effective Hamiltonian is constructed by systematically integrating out the sites of the parent lattice that fall outside such branes [Commun. Phys. 5, 230 (2022)]. Specifically, when such a brane is constructed from a square lattice, it gives rise to an aperiodic Fibonacci quasi-crystal or its rational approximant in one dimension. In this work, starting from square lattice-based models for topological crystalline insulators, protected by the discrete four-fold rotational ($C_4$) symmetry, we show that the resulting one-dimensional projected topological branes encode all the salient signatures of such phases in terms of robust endpoint zero-energy modes, quantized local topological markers, and mid-gap modes bound to dislocation lattice defects, despite such linear branes being devoid of the $C_4$ symmetry of the original lattice. Furthermore, we show that such branes can also feature all the hallmarks of two-dimensional strong and weak topological superconductors through Majorana zero-energy bound states residing near their endpoints and at the core of dislocation lattice defects, besides possessing suitable quantized local topological markers. Finally, we showcase a successful incarnation of a square lattice-based second-order topological insulator with the characteristic corner-localized zero modes in its geometric descendant one-dimensional quasi-crystalline or crystalline branes that feature a quantized localizer index and endpoint zero-energy modes only when one of its end points passes through a corner of the parent crystal. Possible designer quantum and meta material-based platforms to experimentally harness our theoretically proposed topological branes are discussed.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.23783v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Efficient Identification of Critical Transitions via Flow Matching: A Scalable Generative Approach for Many-Body Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15318</link><description>arXiv:2508.15318v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a machine learning framework based on Flow Matching (FM) to identify critical properties in many-body systems efficiently. Using the 2D XY model as a benchmark, we demonstrate that a single network, trained only on configurations from a small ($32\times 32$) lattice at sparse temperature points, effectively generalizes across both temperature and system size. This dual generalization enables two primary applications for large-scale computational physics: (i) a rapid "train-small, predict-large" strategy to locate phase transition points for significantly larger systems ($128\times 128$) without retraining, facilitating efficient finite-size scaling analysis; and (ii) the fast generation of high-fidelity, decorrelated initial spin configurations for large-scale Monte Carlo simulations, providing a robust starting point that bypasses the long thermalization times of traditional samplers. These capabilities arise from the combination of the Flow Matching framework, which learns stable probability-flow vector fields, and the inductive biases of the U-Net architecture that capture scale-invariant local correlations. Our approach offers a scalable and efficient tool for exploring the thermodynamic limit, serving as both a rapid explorer for phase boundaries and a high-performance initializer for high-precision studies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.15318v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Graph atomic cluster expansion for foundational machine learning interatomic potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17936</link><description>arXiv:2508.17936v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: We developed DeFecT-FF, a framework for predicting the energies and ground-state configurations of native point defects, extrinsic dopants, impurities, and defect complexes in zincblende-phase Cd/Zn-Te/Se/S compounds relevant to CdTe-based solar cells. The framework combines high-throughput DFT data with crystal graph-based machine learning force fields (MLFFs) trained to reproduce DFT energies and forces. Alloying at Cd or Te sites offers a route to tune the electronic and defect properties of CdTe absorbers for improved solar efficiency. Given the vast number of possible defect types, charge states, and symmetry-breaking configurations, traditional DFT approaches are computationally prohibitive. Our dataset includes GGA-PBE and HSE06-optimized structures for bulk, alloyed, interface, and grain-boundary systems. Using active learning, we expanded the dataset and trained MLFFs to accurately predict energies across charge states. The model enabled rapid screening and discovery of new low-energy defect configurations, validated through HSE06 calculations with spin-orbit coupling. The DeFecT-FF framework is publicly available as a nanoHUB tool, allowing users to upload crystallographic files, automatically generate defects, and compute defect formation energies versus Fermi level and chemical potentials, greatly reducing the need for expensive DFT simulations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.23514v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Time-Temperature-Transformation (TTT) Diagrams to rationalize the nucleation and quenchability of metastable $\alpha$-Li$_3$PS$_4$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05841</link><description>arXiv:2512.05841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\alpha$-Li$_3$PS$_4$ is a promising solid-state electrolyte with the highest ionic conductivity among its polymorphs. However, its formation presents a thermodynamic paradox: the $\alpha$-phase is the equilibrium phase at high temperature and transforms to the stable $\gamma$-Li$_3$PS$_4$ polymorph when cooled to room temperature; however, $\alpha$-Li$_3$PS$_4$ can be synthesized and quenched in a metastable state via rapid heating at relatively low temperatures. The origin of this synthesizability and anomalous stability has remained elusive. Here, we resolve this paradox by establishing a comprehensive time-temperature-transformation (TTT) diagram, constructed from a computational temperature-size phase diagram and experimental high-time-resolution isothermal measurements. Our density functional theory calculations reveal that at the nanoscale, the $\alpha$-phase is stabilized by its low surface energy, which drastically lowers the nucleation barrier across a wide temperature range. This size-dependent stabilization is directly visualized using in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy, capturing the rapid nucleation of nano-sized $\alpha$-phase and its subsequent slow transformation. This work presents a generalizable framework that integrates thermodynamic and kinetic factors for understanding nucleation and phase transformation mechanisms, providing a rational strategy for the targeted synthesis of functional metastable materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.05841v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Linear magnetoresistance of two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions in the quantum limit</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13475</link><description>arXiv:2512.13475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear magnetoresistance is a hallmark of 3D Weyl metals in the quantum limit. Recently, a pronounced linear magnetoresistance has also been observed in 2D graphene [Xin et al., Nature 616, 270 (2023)]. However, a comprehensive theoretical understanding remains elusive.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of radiation damage in YBa$_2$Cu$3$O${7-\delta}$ (YBCO) is essential for assessing the performance of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tapes in compact fusion reactors. Existing empirical interatomic potentials have been used to model radiation damage in stoichiometric YBCO, but fail to describe oxygen-deficient compositions, which are ubiquitous in industrial Rare-Earth Barium Copper Oxide conductors and strongly influence superconducting properties. In this work, we demonstrate that modern machine-learned interatomic potentials enable predictive modelling of radiation damage in YBCO across a wide range of oxygen stoichiometries, with higher fidelity than previous empirical models. We employ two recently developed approaches: an Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) potential and a tabulated Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP). Both models accurately reproduce Density Functional Theory (DFT) energies, forces, and threshold displacement energy distributions, providing a reliable description of atomic-scale collision processes. Molecular dynamics simulations of 5 keV cascades predict enhanced peak defect production and recombination relative to a widely used empirical potential, indicating different cascade evolution. By explicitly varying oxygen deficiency, we show that total defect production depends only weakly on stoichiometry, offering insight into the robustness of radiation damage processes in oxygen-deficient YBCO. Finally, fusion-relevant 300 keV cascade simulations reveal amorphous regions with dimensions comparable to the superconducting coherence length, consistent with electron microscopy observations of neutron-irradiated HTS tapes. These results establish machine-learned interatomic potentials as efficient and predictive tools for investigating radiation damage in YBCO across relevant compositions and irradiation conditions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24430v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Controllable diatomic molecular quantum thermodynamic machines</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03131</link><description>arXiv:2504.03131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross

By leveraging the vast knowledge encoded during pre-training, prompt engineering—the systematic design and optimization of input instructions—enables researchers to guide LLMs toward accurate and domain-specific outputs without updating model parameters. This review presents the first systematic examination of prompt engineering techniques within organic chemistry, focusing on two critical application areas: text mining and predictive tasks. We analyze the core paradigms of prompt engineering, including prompt design, prompt learning, and prompt tuning, and clarify terminological inconsistencies in the literature.

In mammals, two subtypes of ferritin exist: heavy (H) chain and light (L) chain.  They have very similar 3D structures, but each performs a slightly different role in iron mineral formation.  How sequence differences between the two subtypes affect mineral formation within the nanocages is still unclear.  Single-particle reconstruction of cryo-TEM images was used to build models of unmineralized and partially mineralized human L-chain and H-chain ferritin, which showed that subtle differences in protein structure led to changes in the location of mineral formation within ferritin.  Explicit-solvent atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to explore how sequence-dependent electrostatics modulate ion transport, cluster formation, and mineral nucleation within the confined environment of human L- and H-chain apoferritin nanocages. Employing NaCl as a computational probe, we show that the internal charge distribution governs ion selectivity and nucleation pathways.  Analysis of liquid and solid ionic clusters, combined with Markov State Models (MSMs), reveals that mineralization proceeds through a two-step mechanism involving dense liquid-like precursors that crystallize homogeneously within the cavity.  These findings provide molecular insight into how ferritin sequence variability tunes confinement-driven nucleation and suggest general principles for designing biomimetic nanoreactors.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-8bq1h?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Machine Learning Prediction of Henry Coefficients of Polar and Nonpolar Gases in Covalent Organic Frameworks: Effects of Interlayer Shifts and Functionalization</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-ps69l?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising materials for gas separation and carbon capture.

This paradigm, while successful, is environmentally and economically costly. This review advocates for a fundamental shift: adopting water not just as a green solvent, but as a transformative medium that reshapes our understanding of reactivity and bridges chemistry with biology. Aqueous phase organic synthesis (APOS) has evolved from accidental observations to a deliberate discipline. Water’s unique properties—its high polarity, hydrogen-bonding capacity, and the hydrophobic effect—make it an active participant. This effect drives reactant aggregation and stabilizes transition states, leading to dramatic rate enhancements in pericyclic and condensation reactions. A broad range of reactions thrive in water, including classical carbon–carbon bond-forming reactions like the aldol and Diels–Alder, and modern cross-couplings (e.g., Suzuki–Miyaura) enabled by water-tolerant catalysts. Multicomponent and click chemistries are particularly powerful. Challenges like poor solubility are addressed with micellar catalysis, water-soluble ligands, and precise control of the reaction microenvironment. Beyond sustainability, APOS drives discovery, often yielding improved selectivities, new pathways, and streamlined syntheses of complex targets like pharmaceuticals. Its greatest promise lies in interfacing with biology. Bioorthogonal reactions, such as azide–alkyne cycloadditions, enable labeling and imaging in living organisms. Aqueous compatibility is essential for in situ therapeutic strategies, chemical biology, and advanced bioconjugation techniques for modifying biomolecules. The future converges with emerging technologies: machine learning to navigate complex aqueous systems, flow chemistry for scalability, and the integration of enzymatic with synthetic catalysis. This points toward a unified chemical-biological engineering paradigm. In conclusion, APOS is a mature, versatile field. It is a cornerstone of green chemistry and a critical bridge to biology, accelerating progress in medicine and materials science. Embracing water is both an environmental imperative and a strategic pathway to the next generation of scientific discovery.
Introduction: The Solvent Problem in Organic Synthesis
For generations, organic synthesis has been defined by precise control over molecular structure carried out in rigorously dried environments. Since the emergence of modern organic chemistry in the nineteenth century, water – the very medium that sustains life – has been regarded as an obstacle to chemical transformation. This long-standing assumption has shaped laboratory routines, industrial manufacturing, and chemical education, reinforcing the idea that successful synthesis depends on strict exclusion of moisture. This introduction revisits that historical mindset, evaluates its environmental and economic consequences, and presents the case for a fundamental transition toward aqueous phase organic synthesis (APOS) as a more suitable platform for future chemical and biological innovation.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-0hw4d?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

In this work, we demonstrate that liquid nitrogen quenching (LNQ) can induce a transition from a predominantly ergodic relaxor (ER) to a long-range ferroelectric (FE) state in 0.5 mol. % Mn-modified BNT single crystals. The LNQ-treated crystals exhibit a piezoelectric coefficient of 172 pC/N and a depolarization temperature of 170 °C, representing enhancements of 7 times and 95%, over the as-grown (AG) crystals. This synergistic improvement in piezoelectric performance and thermal stability is associated with enhanced rhombohedral distortion (rhombohedral angle &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;α&lt;/span&gt;: 89.857° for AG vs 89.701° for LNQ) and the ER-to-FE transition driven by LNQ. Local piezoelectric response and the thermal evolution of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;in situ&lt;/span&gt; piezoresponse force microscopy domain structure as well as electrical properties further confirm the improved ferroelectricity and thermal stability induced by liquid nitrogen quenching.

This motivates migration to higher operation frequencies, which demands high-frequency amplification with near-quantum-limited noise characteristics for qubit readout. Here, we report the design and experimental realization of a wireless Josephson parametric amplifier (WJPA) operating above 20 GHz. The wireless design eliminates losses and impedance mismatches that become problematic at high frequencies. The WJPA achieves more than 20 dB of gain across a tunable frequency range of 21–23.5 GHz, with a typical 3 dB bandwidth of 3 MHz. Through Y-factor measurements and a qubit-based photon number calibration, we show that the amplifier exhibits an added noise of approximately two photons.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/1/014004/3376402/Wireless-Josephson-parametric-amplifier-above-20</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Molecular Dynamics Simulations Accelerated on FPGA with High-Bandwidth Memory</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00391A</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, Accepted Manuscript&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00391A, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY-NC.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Jing Xiao, Jinfeng Chen, Ye Ding, You Xu, Jing Huang&lt;br /&gt;Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is a powerful tool for investigating complex systems in physical, materials, and biological sciences.

Abstract: As quantum dot (QD)-based spin qubits advance toward larger, more complex device architectures, rapid, automated device characterization and data analysis tools become critical. The orientation and spacing of transition lines in a charge stability diagram (CSD) contain a fingerprint of a QD device's capacitive environment, making these measurements useful tools for device characterization. However, manually interpreting these features is time-consuming, error-prone, and impractical at scale. Here, we present an automated protocol for extracting underlying capacitive properties from CSDs. Our method integrates machine learning, image processing, and object detection to identify and track charge transitions across large datasets without manual labeling. We demonstrate this method using experimentally measured data from a strained-germanium single-quantum-well (planar) and a strained-germanium double-quantum-well (bilayer) QD device. Unlike for planar QD devices, CSDs in bilayer germanium heterostructure exhibit a larger set of transitions, including interlayer tunneling and distinct loading lines for the vertically stacked QDs, making them a powerful testbed for automation methods. By analyzing the properties of many CSDs, we can statistically estimate physically relevant quantities, like relative lever arms and capacitive couplings. Thus, our protocol enables rapid extraction of useful, nontrivial information about QD devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00067v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Atomic-Scale Mechanisms of Li-Ion Transport Mediated by Li10GeP2S12 in Composite Solid Polyethylene Oxide Electrolytes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00112</link><description>arXiv:2601.00112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer electrolytes incorporating Li$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$ (LGPS) nanoparticles show promise for solid-state lithium batteries owing to their enhanced ionic conductivity, though the governing mechanisms remain unclear. We combine molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, experimental ionic conductivity measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the effect of LGPS loading on polyethylene oxide (PEO) structure and Li-ion transport. MD and experimental results agree up to 10\% LGPS, showing a volcano-shaped conductivity trend driven by polymer segmental dynamics and interfacial effects. Beyond 10\%, experiments reveal additional conductivity enhancement unexplained by MD, suggesting a distinct transport regime. DFT calculations indicate that Li-ion migration at the PEO|LGPS interface proceeds via vacancy-mediated hopping, with low barriers favored by S-rich interfacial sites and hindered by Ge. These findings link interfacial chemistry and microstructure to Li-ion dynamics, offering guidelines for designing high-performance composite polymer electrolytes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00112v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Engineering Ideal 2D Type-II Nodal Line Semimetals via Stacking and Intercalation of van der Waals Layers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00407</link><description>arXiv:2601.00407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional type-II topological semimetals (TSMs), characterized by strongly tilted Dirac cones, have attracted intense interest for their unconventional electronic properties and exotic transport behaviors. However, rational design remains challenging due to the sensitivity of band tilting to lattice geometry, atomic coordination, and symmetry constraints. Here, we present a bottom-up approach to engineer ideal type-II nodal line semimetals (NLSMs) in van der Waals bilayers via atomic intercalation. Using monolayer $h$-AlN as a prototype, we show that fluorine-intercalated bilayer AlN (F@BL-AlN) hosts a symmetry-protected type-II nodal loop precisely at the Fermi level, enabled by preserved mirror symmetry ($\mathcal{M}_z$) and tailored interlayer hybridization. First-principles calculations reveal that fluorine not only tunes interlayer coupling but also aligns the Fermi energy with the nodal line, stabilizing the type-II NLSM phase. The system exhibits tunable electronic properties under external electric and strain fields and features a van Hove singularity that induces spontaneous ferromagnetism, realizing a ferromagnetic topological semimetal state. This work provides a versatile platform for designing type-II NLSMs and offers practical guidance for their experimental realization.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00407v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Kinetic Turing Instability and Emergent Spectral Scaling in Chiral Active Turbulence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21012</link><description>arXiv:2508.21012v5 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spontaneous emergence of coherent structures from chaotic backgrounds is a hallmark of active biological swarms. We investigate this self-organization by simulating an ensemble of polar chiral active agents that couple locally via a Kuramoto interaction. We demonstrate that the system's transition from chaos to active turbulence is characterized by quantized loop phase currents and coherent clustering, and that this transition is strictly governed by a kinetic Turing instability. By deriving the continuum kinetic theory for the model, we identify that the competition between local phase-locking and active agent motility selects a critical structural wavenumber. The instability then drives the system into a state of developed, active turbulence that exhibits stable, robust power-laws in spectral density, suggestive of universality and consistent with observations from a broad range of turbulent phenomena. Our results bridge the gap between discrete chimera states and continuous fluid turbulence, suggesting that the statistical scaling laws of active turbulence can arise from fundamental kinetic instability criteria.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.21012v5</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] New RVE concept in thermoelasticity of periodic composites subjected to compact support loading</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00018</link><description>arXiv:2601.00018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an advanced Computational Analytical Micromechanics (CAM) framework for linear thermoelastic composites (CMs) with periodic microstructures. The approach is based on an exact new Additive General Integral Equation (AGIE), formulated for compactly supported loading conditions, such as body forces and localized thermal effects (for example laser heating). In addition, new general integral equations (GIEs) are established for arbitrary mechanical and thermal loading. A unified iterative scheme is developed for solving the static AGIEs, where the compact support of loading serves as a new fundamental training parameter. At the core of the methodology lies a generalized Representative Volume Element (RVE) concept that extends Hill classical definition of the RVE. Unlike conventional RVEs, this generalized RVE is not fixed geometrically but emerges naturally from the characteristic scale of localized loading, thereby reducing the analysis of an infinite periodic medium to a finite, data-driven domain. This formulation automatically filters out nonrepresentative subsets of effective parameters while eliminating boundary effects, edge artifacts, and finite-size sample dependencies. Furthermore, the AGIE-based CAM framework integrates seamlessly with machine learning (ML) and neural network (NN) architectures, supporting the development of accurate, physics-informed surrogate nonlocal operators.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00018v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Additive general integral equations in thermoelastic micromechanics of composites</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00019</link><description>arXiv:2601.00019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents an enhanced Computational Analytical Micromechanics (CAM) framework for the analysis of linear thermoelastic composite materials (CMs) with random microstructure. The proposed approach is grounded in an exact Additive General Integral Equation (AGIE), specifically formulated for compactly supported loading, including both body forces and localized thermal changes (such as those from laser heating). New general integral equations (GIEs) for arbitrary mechanical and thermal loading are proposed. A unified iterative solution strategy is developed for the static AGIE, applicable to CMs with both perfectly and imperfectly bonded interfaces, where the compact support of loading is introduced as a new fundamental training parameter. Central to this methodology is a generalized Representative Volume Element (RVE) concept, which extends Hill classical definition. The resulting RVE is not predefined geometrically, but rather emerges from the characteristic scale of the localized loading, effectively reducing the analysis of an infinite, randomly heterogeneous medium to a finite, data-driven domain. This generalized RVE approach enables automatic exclusion of unrepresentative subsets of effective parameters, while inherently eliminating boundary effects, edge artifacts, and finite size limitations. Moreover, the AGIE-based CAM framework is naturally compatible with machine learning (ML) and neural network (NN) architectures, facilitating the construction of accurate and physically informed surrogate nonlocal operators.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00019v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Accurate Screening of Functional Materials with Machine-Learning Potential and Transfer-Learned Regressions: Heusler Alloy Benchmark</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20556</link><description>arXiv:2508.20556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A machine learning-accelerated high-throughput (HTP) workflow for the discovery of magnetic materials is presented. As a test case, we screened quaternary and all-$d$ Heusler compounds for stable compounds with large magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy ($E_{\mathrm{aniso}}$). Structure optimization and evaluation of formation energy and distance to hull convex were performed using the eSEN-30M-OAM interatomic potential, while local magnetic moments, phonon stability, magnetic stability, and $E_{\mathrm{aniso}}$ were predicted by eSEM models trained on our DxMag Heusler database. A frozen transfer learning strategy was employed to improve accuracy. Candidate compounds identified by the ML-HTP workflow were validated with density functional theory, confirming high predictive precision. We also benchmark the performance of different uMLIPs, discuss the fidelity of local magnetic moment prediction, and demonstrate generalization to unseen elements via transfer learning from a universal interatomic potential.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.20556v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Modulation of structural short-range order due to chemical patterning in multi-component amorphous interfacial complexions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06166</link><description>arXiv:2509.06166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amorphous interfacial complexions have been shown to restrict grain growth and improve damage tolerance in nanocrystalline alloys, with increased chemical complexity stabilizing the complexions themselves. Here, we investigate local chemical composition and structural short-range order in Cu-rich, multi-component nanocrystalline alloys to understand how dopants self-organize within these amorphous complexions and how local structure is altered. High resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and elemental analysis are used to study both grain boundaries and interphase boundaries, with chemical partitioning observed for both. Notably, the amorphous-crystalline transition region is observed to be enriched in certain dopant species and depleted of others as compared to the interior of the amorphous complexions. This chemical patterning can be explained in terms of the elemental preference for ordered or disordered grain boundary environments. As only a qualitative measure of structural short-range order can be obtained with nanobeam electron diffraction for these specimens, atomistic simulations with a custom-built machine learning interatomic potential are then used to probe how dopant patterning affects local structural state. Increased grain boundary chemical complexity is found to result in a more disordered complexion structure, with segregation to the amorphous-crystalline transition regions driving changes in local structure that are sensitive to dopant ratios. As a whole, the intimate connection between local chemistry and order in amorphous interfacial complexions is demonstrated, opening the door for microstructural engineering within the amorphous complexions themselves.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.06166v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Temperature and Pressure Dependent Vibrational Properties of Pristine and Doped Vacancy-Ordered Double Perovskite</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21810</link><description>arXiv:2512.21810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding lattice dynamics and structural transitions in vacancy-ordered double perovskites is crucial for developing lead-free optoelectronic materials, yet the role of dopants in modulatingthese properties remains poorly understood. We investigate the vibrational and optical properties of pristine and Antimony(Sb)-doped Cs$_2$TiCl$_6$ vacancy-ordered double perovskite through temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy (4-273 K), high-pressure studies (0- \~30 GPa), ambient powder XRD, and photoluminescence measurements. Sb doping improves phase purity, reducing impurity-related Raman modes present in pristine samples. Most notably, Sb-doped samples exhibit an anomalous Raman mode M$_1$ appearing exclusively below 100 K at 314-319 cm$^{-1}$, accompanied by changes in the temperature coefficient $\chi$ and anharmonic constant $A$ across this threshold. This behavior is absent in pristine Cs$_2$TiCl$_6$. While these observations suggest possible structural changes at low temperature, the origin of the M$_1$ mode remains unclear and may arise from disorder-activated vibrations, symmetry breaking, or dopant-induced local distortions. Low-temperature structural characterization is needed to confirm the nature of this transition. Photoluminescence shows broad self-trapped exciton emission at 448 nm with broader FWHM in Sb-doped samples (164.73 nm) compared to Bi-doped samples (138.2 nm), consistent with enhanced structural disorder. High-pressure Raman measurements reveal continuous mode hardening to 30 GPa with no phase transitions. These results demonstrate that Sb doping modulates the vibrational properties of Cs$_2$TiCl$_6$, though further investigation is required to establish the underlying mechanisms.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21810v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Support Vector Machine Kernels as Quantum Propagators</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11153</link><description>arXiv:2502.11153v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Selecting optimal kernels for regression in physical systems remains a challenge, often relying on trial-and-error with standard functions. In this work, we establish a mathematical correspondence between support vector machine kernels and quantum propagators, demonstrating that kernel efficacy is determined by its spectral alignment with the system's Green's function. Based on this isomorphism, we propose a unified, physics-informed framework for kernel selection and design. For systems with known propagator forms, we derive analytical selection rules that map standard kernels to physical operators. For complex systems where the Green's function is analytically intractable, we introduce a constructive numerical method using the Kernel Polynomial Method with Jackson smoothing to generate custom, physics-aligned kernels. Numerical experiments spanning electrical conductivity, electronic band structure, anharmonic oscillators, and photonic crystals demonstrate that this framework consistently performs well as long as there is an alignment with a Green's function.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.11153v3</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Ternary Transition Metal Oxides for Electrochemical Energy Storage: Synthesis, Advantages, Design Strategies, and Future Prospects</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-2jncj-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Ternary transition metal oxides (TTMOs) have emerged as a new class of electrode materials for high-performance energy storage systems, particularly supercapacitors (SCs) and hybrid battery-capacitor devices. This comprehensive review aims to comprehensively survey recent advances in the design, synthesis, and analysis of TTMOs-based nanostructures for supercapacitor (SC) electrodes. It begins by outlining the key concepts related to charge storage mechanisms in SC electrodes, electric double-layer capacitance (EDL), pseudocapacitive (PC), and battery-type (BT) behavior, followed by a clarification of device configurations, including symmetric SC (SSC), asymmetric SC (ASC), and hybrid SC (HSC) devices. This review then examines the fabrication strategies for TTMOs, emphasizing the impact of synthetic approaches on material morphology, crystallinity, and electrochemical performance. Special attention is given to the structure-property relationships that govern ion transport and charge storage dynamics in these materials. The influence of morphological features, including dimensionality, porosity, and hierarchical architecture, on electrochemical behavior is critically analyzed. A comparative evaluation of electrochemical matrices across various TTMO electrodes is presented, highlighting key performance and challenges. Ultimately, the review highlights emerging trends, current limitations, and future research directions that are poised to accelerate the development of next-generation TTMO materials for advanced energy storage technologies.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-2jncj-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Tunable Gelation and Viscoelasticity of Lung-Tissue–Mimetic Sealant: Linking Shear History to In Situ Mechanical Performance through Physics-Informed Machine Learning</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-zkrvp?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Hydrogel-based lung sealants are optimized largely based on formulation and post-cure mechanics, even though deformation history during delivery and placement plays a critical, yet under-characterized, role in determining in situ performance. This disconnect is particularly consequential on the application of lung sealants, where excessive stiffness promotes delamination while insufficient stiffness compromises airtight sealing. Here, we establish a quantitative process–structure–property framework for a gelatin–tannic acid–transglutaminase lung-mimetic sealant by integrating time-resolved rheology with physics-informed machine learning.

Using small-amplitude oscillatory shear and steady torsional flow at 37 °C, we show that gelation follows a reproducible kinetic clock (storage modulus, G′– loss modulus, G″, crossover at ~100 s; modulus plateau by ~600 s), while the attainable viscoelastic state is strongly governed by deformation history. Increasing oscillatory strain amplitude from 0.1 % to 50 % suppresses network maturation, reducing the post-gelation storage modulus, G′,  from ~10⁶ to ~10⁴ Pa, whereas sustained steady shear (0.01–1 s⁻¹) decreases magnitude of complex viscosity by 2–3 orders of magnitude and permanently downshifts elastic moduli, G′–, from ≈3.5×10³ to ≈4×10² Pa. These modulus ranges span the effective compliance of lung parenchyma under physiological tidal strain, delineating mechanical regimes associated with airtight sealing, strain accommodation, or premature interfacial failure. Controlled aeration during the processing of the sealant further decreases stiffness by ~30 % without altering gelation kinetics, providing an additional, physically interpretable compliance-tuning mechanism.

To unify these effects, we introduce a dimensionless Degree of Gelation (DoG), serving as a rheological state variable that collapses oscillatory and steady-shear histories into a single, time-resolved descriptor of network evolution. Machine-learning models trained on experimentally accessible inputs (time, strain amplitude, shear rate, frequency, aeration) accurately predict DoG (R² ≈ 0.9) and, in inverse mode, identify handling conditions required to achieve targeted in situ mechanical states.

This rheology–machine-learning framework reframes lung sealant development from a static materials optimization problem to a controllable, process-driven design strategy. By quantitatively linking applicator-level parameters to failure-relevant mechanical outcomes—airtightness, compliance, and resistance to delamination—it provides a mechanistic and generalizable foundation for the design of injectable hydrogels, bioadhesives, and tissue-interfacing</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-zkrvp?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Discovery of β-Sheet Peptide Assembly Codes via an Experimentally Validated Predictive Computational Platform</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-4c5h0?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Deciphering the sequence codes governing ordered peptide assemblies remains challenging due to the need to explore vast sequence space with atomic resolution. Here, we present an experimentally validated computational framework combining hybrid-resolution molecular dynamics and machine learning for the discovery of β-sheet-rich amyloid-forming peptides. Through exhaustive simulations of all 8,000 tripeptides, we demonstrate that the widely used aggregation propensity (AP) is not effective in predicting β-sheet assembly. We introduce Amyloid-Like Tendency (ALT), a metric enabled by our hybrid-resolution simulations that effectively identifies cross-β architectures. Leveraging this physics-informed dataset, we further fine-tuned the Uni-Mol model to efficiently screen 160,000 tetrapeptides. Experimental validation of 46 candidates confirmed a predictive accuracy of ~85%, yielding 26 novel amyloid-forming peptides, including multiple hydrogelators. Mechanistic analysis reveals that specific sidechain stacking and central amino acid identity, beyond generic hydrophobicity, dictate ordered assembly. This establishes a scalable pipeline for the targeted design of functional peptide materials.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-4c5h0?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Continued Challenges in High-Throughput Materials Predictions: MatterGen predicts compounds from the training dataset.</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-mkls8-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>High-throughput computational tools and generative AI models aim to revolutionise materials discovery by enabling the rapid prediction of novel inorganic compounds. However, these tools face persistent challenges with modelling compounds where multiple elements occupy the same crystallographic site, often leading to misclassification of known disordered phases as new ordered compounds. Recently, Microsoft revealed MatterGen as a tool for predicting new materials. As a proof of concept, MatterGen was used to predict the novel compound TaCr2O6, which was subsequently synthesised in a disordered form as Ta1/3Cr2/3O2. However, detailed crystallographic analysis, presented in this paper, reveals that this is not a novel compound but is identical to the already known compound Ta1/2Cr1/2O2 reported in 1972 and actually included in MatterGen’s training dataset. These findings underscore the necessity of rigorous human verification in AI-assisted materials research, limiting their use for rapid and large-scale prediction of new materials. While generative models hold great promise, their effectiveness is currently limited by unresolved issues with disorder prediction and dataset validation. Improved integration with crystallographic expertise is essential to realise their full potential.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-mkls8-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Pressure- and Temperature-Dependent Ionic Transport in Ag₄Zr₃S₈ Nanocrystal Pellets</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-t7qrx?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Nanocrystal (NC)–derived solid electrolytes provide access to compositionally complex and metastable ion conductors, yet their measured transport properties are often dominated by extrinsic contact effects. We probe the coupled roles of temperature, uniaxial pressure, pellet microstructure, and electrode material on the electrochemical impedance response of Ag₄Zr₃S₈ NC pellets. Ag₄Zr₃S₈ NCs were synthesized via colloidal routes using distinct sulfur sources and consolidated into pellets with controlled surface chemistry. EIS was performed over 298–393 K and 0.43–8.67 MPa using blocking and non-blocking electrodes. Pressure-dependent Nyquist analysis shows impedance is overwhelmingly dominated by interfacial and constriction resistances, with pressure primarily reducing contact limitations rather than altering intrinsic ion transport. Temperature–pressure heat maps of the high-frequency resistance reveal thermally activated transport strongly modulated by mechanical contact and electrode compatibility. These results establish pressure-resolved impedance spectroscopy as a diagnostic framework for separating intrinsic and extrinsic transport contributions in NC-based solid electrolytes.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-t7qrx?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Mechanistic Evidence for Dibutyl Phthalate as an Environmental Trigger for Inflammatory Bowel Disease</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02880-9?rss=yes</link><description>Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) is a ubiquitous pollutant, but its molecular link to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is undefined.

In this study, an irradiation-hardened quasi-vertical GaN PiN diode with a beveled-mesa termination structure is fabricated, exhibiting only an 8% reduction in blocking voltage under 1.3 GeV Ta ion irradiation with a high fluence of ∼10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; ions/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This robustness enables in-depth analysis of electrical degradation under the synergistic effects of irradiation and bias voltage. Forward &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;–&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;V&lt;/span&gt; analysis reveals reductions in minority carrier lifetime, mobility, and diffusion length. Temperature-dependent reverse &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;I–V&lt;/span&gt; characteristics show an upward shift in the transition voltage from variable range hopping leakage to space-charge-limited current conduction in irradiated devices, with additional involvement of trap-assisted Poole–Frenkel emission. deep-level transient spectroscopy identifies a shallow trap E2 (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; − 0.1 eV) and two deep traps, E1 (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; − 0.43 eV) and H1 (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;v + 0.68 eV). E1 exhibits a twofold increase in trap density post-irradiation and is attributed to dislocation-related defects or Ga vacancies. H1 likely originates from dissociation of Mg–H complexes under irradiation, forming Mg&lt;sub&gt;Ga&lt;/sub&gt; and related complexes such as Mg&lt;sub&gt;Ga&lt;/sub&gt;-V&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;. These traps, driven by the high electronic energy loss, could introduce localized recombination centers and scattering sites. These results offer critical insights into the irradiation-induced degradation mechanisms and design strategies for GaN-based power diodes (e.g., PiN diodes and Schottky diodes) and high electron mobility transistors in aerospace electronic systems.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/1/012101/3376084/Trap-induced-degradation-mechanisms-in-quasi</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] A data-driven approach to control stimulus responsivity of functional polymer materials: Predicting thermoresponsive color-change properties of polydiacetylene</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00442J</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, Accepted Manuscript&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00442J, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Risako Shibata, Nano Shioda, Hiroaki Imai, Yasuhiko Igarashi, Yuya Oaki&lt;br /&gt;Sensing devices are fabricated using stimuli-responsive materials.

Here, Wedal et al. synthesize Mn catalysts containing pincer ligands with an additional hemilabile donor designed to prevent catalyst decomposition. These complexes give excellent turnover numbers, turnover frequencies, and lifetimes for CO2 hydrogenation to formate. Catalytic performance is related to the binding strength of the hemilabile donor, which cannot be too strong or too weak.

Li-Argyrodite (Li6PS5Cl) is a promising SSE with high ionic conductivity, produced using cheap and sustainable precursors, and therefore of interest to both academia and industry. Like many other sulfide-based SSEs, it is however unstable against Li-metal. Using ab-initio and machine-learning methods, we simulate three representative Li-metal/Li-Argyrodite interface models to investigate whether the exact surface termination affects the chemical stability and ion transport capability. We present a systematic approach to create low-energy interfaces by screening 28 low Miller-index surface terminations of Li-argyrodite and coupling them with Li-metal. Custom-made machine-learned interatomic potentials trained on ab-initio data enable the simulation of large interface models with over 2000 atoms for 5 ns. We find that all three interfaces decompose into an amorphous solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, consisting of Li3P, Li2S and LiCl, which then crystallizes into an antifluorite phase Li2S{1-x-y}P{x}Cl{y}; {x,y = 0.14-0.15}. A two orders of magnitude decrease in Li-ion flux shows that the crystalline SEI layer is a sluggish ion conductor, similar to Li2S. While all three interfaces form the same crystalline SEI layer, the exact rates of the decomposition and crystallisation depend on the actual surface composition. These atomic-level insights could potentially be used to control the SEI formation in sulphide-based SSEs and others.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-5d9nq?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Cellulose Coating Altered the Electro-Chemo-Mechanical Evolution of Sodium Thioantimonate Electrolyte in Solid-state Sodium Batteries: An Operando Raman Study</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-bwt22?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>All-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) attracted increasing attention due to their improved safety and energy densities; yet electrolyte decomposition and subsequent contact loss limited the interfacial stability of ASSBs. Herein, we report an operando Raman characterization that provides high voltage, time, and spatial resolutions, which enables simultaneous analysis of interfacial decomposition mechanism and morphological evolution. Using Na3SbS4 electrolyte (NSS) and its carboxymethyl-cellulose-encapsulated analogue (NSS-CMC) as exemplars, we precisely contrasted the subtle differences in the two-step reduction mechanism of the two electrolytes. In both systems, Na3SbS3 formed as an intermediate, and Na3Sb binary as one major final product; while the CMC coating altered the kinetics of Na3SbS3 formation and consumption, and extended the formation potential of Na3Sb from 1.35 V (seen in NSS) to 0.50 V (vs. Na/Na+). Oxidation of NSS and NSS-CMC both occur near 2.20 V, although CMC coating altered the crystallinity of the oxidative products. Simultaneously, we captured phenomena that are unique to solid-state electrochemical systems such as particle relocation, morphological change, and reversed reactions. We inferred CMC’s dual role as a voltage barrier and a mechanical buffer in suppressing the electro-chemo-mechanical decomposition of NSS electrolyte. The deep mechanistic insights unravel the exact modification needed for improved interfacial stability.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-bwt22?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Ensemble Transformer with Post-hoc Explanations for Depression Emotion and Severity Detection</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02866-4?rss=yes</link><description>This study presents an ensemble transformer framework for detecting depression-related emotions and classifying their severity in social media text.

The traditional approach often led to redundant engineering effort, high costs, and opaque systems that limit reproducibility, independent scrutiny, and scientific independence.  

This perspective advocates for permissively licensed open source software as a scientific and economic multiplier by reducing the duplication of effort, enabling scientific validation of modeling tools, and frictionless experimentation with new ideas. Coordinated, multi-project consortia, such as Open Force Field, Open Free Energy, OpenFold, and OpenADMET have formed to collaboratively build shared computational infrastructure and release all methods under permissive licenses. The success of these large-scale efforts requires organizational structures that extend beyond code. The Open Molecular Software Foundation (OMSF), a US nonprofit, serves as a domain-specific institutional home and fiscal sponsor. By providing governance, administrative infrastructure, and dedicated research software engineers, OMSF aligns incentives across academic and industrial stakeholders. This framework enables a synergistic ecosystem where projects interoperate to accelerate innovation, eliminate duplication, and ensure long-term software sustainability, thereby creating durable foundations that elevate the entire molecular modeling community.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-6n5lz?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Here we report a full enumeration and computational exploration of this space. Density functional theory-based geometry optimisation and energy calculations have identified all stable molecules within this space, forming a new database called CHX8. A universal strain value has been proposed and assigned to each of these molecules, acting as a proxy for synthesisability and providing a clear guideline of how synthetically plausible these molecules could be. This paper explores the limits of chemical space with CHX8, with a focus on trans-fused, unsaturated and anti-Bredt ring systems. We show that, contrary to prevailing wisdom, most of these unconventional structures should be synthetically accessible, with relative strain energies less than that of cubane. It is expected that this dataset will inspire the synthesis of many new molecules with applications in various areas of chemistry, biology and materials science. The resulting dataset also provides a valuable resource for the development of general and robust machine learning models.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-qjr5r?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] A round-robin exercise for the precise prediction of aqueous solubility of organic chemicals using chemometric, machine learning, and stacking ensemble of deep learning models</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-6xb6k?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Aqueous solubility is an important property for assessing the druggability and ecotoxicological effects of molecules. Successful drug candidates should have optimal aqueous solubility to improve bioavailability to target tissues. To effectively screen molecules in a short period of time, reliable predictive models are highly useful. In the present study, we conducted a round-robin exercise using a large, curated dataset of over 6000 compounds to predict aqueous solubility quantitatively. The six participating groups used an array of Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms to develop models with strong robustness and external predictive performance. All the models underwent rigorous Leave-One-Out and 10-fold cross-validation. The diversity of training sets and descriptor types used by different groups paved the way for exploring the mechanistic basis for the efficient identification of contributing features. The best-performing model was selected using the statistical Sum of Ranking Differences (SRD) approach, considering the performances on training, cross-validation, and test, as well as the performance difference between the training and test sets. Additionally, a curated, true external set was screened by the six different models. Here, the best-performing model was selected using a consensus ranking strategy based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R_Ext^2. In both approaches, i.e., the inherent model performance in terms of training, test, and cross-validation statistics, and the ability of the model to efficiently predict true external data, the Stacking Ensemble of Deep q-RASPR model emerged as the winner. This model showed comparable predictive performance to the previously reported model, which apparently lacked a proper data curation workflow and contained a significant number of duplicates and mixtures in its dataset, which can inflate model statistics. The insights from the different feature contributions from the different groups identified the useful structural and physicochemical aspects, which can help synthetic chemists to optimize molecules.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-6xb6k?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Joule] Seeing the unseen: Real-time tracking of battery cycling-to-failure via surface strain</title><link>https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00453-2?rss=yes</link><description>This study proposes a strain-based approach to address passive failures in lithium-ion batteries, which present spontaneous safety risks often indistinguishable from routine degradation using conventional diagnostics. By establishing a strain-failure correlation, we introduce a slope-based threshold and a failure-proximity index to characterize degradation-to-failure transitions. Incorporating strain-informed machine learning, it effectively detects early failure onset and estimates proximity. This scalable approach is suitable for real-time, onboard monitoring, supporting safer and more reliable battery operation.</description><author>Joule</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00453-2?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] AI-Driven Robotic Crystal Explorer for Rapid Polymorph Identification</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00203F</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, Accepted Manuscript&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00203F, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY-NC.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Lee Cronin, Daniel Salley, Edward Lee, Abhishek Sharma&lt;br /&gt;Crystallisation is an important phenomenon which facilitates the purification as well as structural and bulk phase material characterisation using crystallographic methods.

We investigated the Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI) as a potential biomarker to refine risk assessment. Analyzing 1,163 discovery, 208 internal-validation, and 212 external-validation APE patients, we found that a higher PNI was independently associated with lower 30-day and in-hospital mortality after multivariable adjustment. Incorporating PNI into the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) risk model improved its predictive performance for 30-day mortality.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02884-6?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Association between Immune Cells and Multiple Cancers: Insights from Mendelian Randomization and Gene-based Analysis</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02879-2?rss=yes</link><description>To investigate the roles of immune cells in cancer, we conducted Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses of 731 immune cells and 16 site-specific cancers, alongside gene-based and enrichment analyses. MR identified 79 significant associations (46 protective, 33 risk-enhancing). Key findings include BAFF-R on B cells lowering melanoma risk, and CD27 on B cells increasing lung cancer risk.

This meta-analysis assessed the hepatotoxicity risk, measured by elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), for new-generation ALK inhibitors versus crizotinib through eight randomized controlled trials with 2,114 patients. The results suggested that new-generation ALK inhibitors were associated with a significantly reduced risk of all-grade ALT elevation (RR=0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] (0.58, 0.92)) and a trend toward reduced risk of grade 3–5 ALT elevation (RR=0.55, 95%CI (0.29, 1.06)).</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02874-3?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Abstract: Altermagnetism is a newly discovered fundamental form of magnetic order, distinct from conventional ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. It uniquely exhibits no net magnetization while simultaneously breaking time-reversal symmetry, a combination previously thought to be mutually exclusive. Although its existence and signatures in momentum space have been established, the direct real-space visualization of its defining rotational symmetry breaking has remained a missing cornerstone. Here, using scanning tunnelling microscopy, we present atomic-scale imaging of electronic states in the candidate material CsV2Se2O. We directly visualize the hallmark symmetry breaking in the form of unidirectional electronic patterns tied to magnetic domain walls and spin defects, as well as elliptical charging rings surrounding those defects. These observed electronic states are all linked to the underlying alternating spin texture. Our work provides the foundational real-space evidence for altermagnetism, moving the field from theoretical and momentum-space probes to direct visual confirmation; thereby opening a path to explore how this unconventional magnetic order couples to and controls other quantum electronic states.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24114v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Insights Into Radiation Damage in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ From Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24430</link><description>arXiv:2512.24430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of radiation damage in YBa$_2$Cu$3$O${7-\delta}$ (YBCO) is essential for assessing the performance of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tapes in compact fusion reactors. Existing empirical interatomic potentials have been used to model radiation damage in stoichiometric YBCO, but fail to describe oxygen-deficient compositions, which are ubiquitous in industrial Rare-Earth Barium Copper Oxide conductors and strongly influence superconducting properties. In this work, we demonstrate that modern machine-learned interatomic potentials enable predictive modelling of radiation damage in YBCO across a wide range of oxygen stoichiometries, with higher fidelity than previous empirical models. We employ two recently developed approaches: an Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) potential and a tabulated Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP). Both models accurately reproduce Density Functional Theory (DFT) energies, forces, and threshold displacement energy distributions, providing a reliable description of atomic-scale collision processes. Molecular dynamics simulations of 5 keV cascades predict enhanced peak defect production and recombination relative to a widely used empirical potential, indicating different cascade evolution. By explicitly varying oxygen deficiency, we show that total defect production depends only weakly on stoichiometry, offering insight into the robustness of radiation damage processes in oxygen-deficient YBCO. Finally, fusion-relevant 300 keV cascade simulations reveal amorphous regions with dimensions comparable to the superconducting coherence length, consistent with electron microscopy observations of neutron-irradiated HTS tapes. These results establish machine-learned interatomic potentials as efficient and predictive tools for investigating radiation damage in YBCO across relevant compositions and irradiation conditions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24430v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Upscaling from ab initio atomistic simulations to electrode scale: The case of manganese hexacyanoferrate, a cathode material for Na-ion batteries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24816</link><description>arXiv:2512.24816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generalizable scale-bridging computational framework that enables predictive modeling of insertion-type electrode materials from atomistic to device scales. Applied to sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate, a promising cathode material for grid-scale sodium-ion batteries, our methodology employs an active-learning strategy to train a Moment Tensor Potential through iterative hybrid grand-canonical Monte Carlo--molecular dynamics sampling, robustly capturing configuration spaces at all sodiation levels. The resulting machine learning interatomic potential accurately reproduces experimental properties including volume expansion, operating voltage, and sodium concentration-dependent structural transformations, while revealing a four-order-of-magnitude difference in sodium diffusivity between the rhombohedral (sodium-rich) and tetragonal (sodium-poor) phases at 300 K. We directly compute all critical parameters -- temperature- and concentration-dependent diffusivities, interfacial and strain energies, and complete free-energy landscapes -- to feed them into pseudo-2D phase-field simulations that predict phase-boundary propagation and rate-dependent performances across electrode length scales. This multiscale workflow establishes a blueprint for rational computational design of next-generation insertion-type materials, such as battery electrode materials, demonstrating how atomistic insights can be systematically translated into continuum-scale predictions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24816v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] SSCHA-based evolutionary crystal structure prediction at finite temperatures with account for quantum nuclear motion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24849</link><description>arXiv:2512.24849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate crystal structure prediction (CSP) at finite temperatures with quantum anharmonic effects remains challenging but very prominent in systems with lightweight atoms such as superconducting hydrides. In this work, we integrate machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) with the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA) to enable evolutionary CSP on the quantum anharmonic free-energy landscape. Using LaH$_{10}$ at 150 GPa and 300 K as a test case, we compare two approaches for SSCHA-based CSP: using light-weight active-learning MLIPs (AL-MLIPs) trained on-the-fly from scratch, and foundation models or universal MLIPs (uMLIPs) from the Matbench project. We demonstrate that AL-MLIPs allow to correctly predict the experimentally known cubic Fm$\bar{3}$m phase as the most stable polymorph at 150 GPa but require corrections within the thermodynamic perturbation theory to get consistent results. The uMLIP Mattersim-5m allow to conduct SSCHA-based CSP without requiring per-structure training and even get correct structure ranking near the global minimum, though fine-tuning may be needed for higher accuracy. Our results show that including quantum anharmonicity simplifies the free-energy landscape and is essential for correct stability rankings, that is especially important for high-temperature phases that could be missed in classical 0 K CSP. The proposed approach extends the reach of CSP to systems where quantum nuclear motion and anharmonicity dominate.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24849v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Large language models and the entropy of English</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24969</link><description>arXiv:2512.24969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use large language models (LLMs) to uncover long-ranged structure in English texts from a variety of sources. The conditional entropy or code length in many cases continues to decrease with context length at least to $N\sim 10^4$ characters, implying that there are direct dependencies or interactions across these distances. A corollary is that there are small but significant correlations between characters at these separations, as we show from the data independent of models. The distribution of code lengths reveals an emergent certainty about an increasing fraction of characters at large $N$. Over the course of model training, we observe different dynamics at long and short context lengths, suggesting that long-ranged structure is learned only gradually. Our results constrain efforts to build statistical physics models of LLMs or language itself.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24969v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Emergence of 3D Superconformal Ising Criticality on the Fuzzy Sphere</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25054</link><description>arXiv:2512.25054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersymmetric conformal field theories (SCFTs) form a unique subset of quantum field theories which provide powerful insights into strongly coupled critical phenomena. Here, we present a microscopic and non-perturbative realization of the three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal Ising critical point, based on a Yukawa-type coupling between a 3D Ising CFT and a gauged Majorana fermion. Using the recently developed fuzzy sphere regularization, we directly extract the scaling dimensions of low-lying operators via the state-operator correspondence. At the critical point, we demonstrate conformal multiplet structure together with the hallmark of emergent spacetime supersymmetry through characteristic relations between fermionic and bosonic operators. Moreover, by tuning the Yukawa coupling, we explicitly track the evolution of operator spectra from the decoupled Ising-Majorana fixed point to the interacting superconformal fixed point, revealing renormalization-group flow at the operator level. Our results establish a controlled, non-perturbative microscopic route to 3D SCFTs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.25054v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Learning Density Functionals to Bridge Particle and Continuum Scales</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23840</link><description>arXiv:2512.23840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting interfacial thermodynamics across molecular and continuum scales remains a central challenge in computational science. Classical density functional theory (cDFT) provides a first-principles route to connect microscopic interactions with macroscopic observables, but its predictive accuracy depends on approximate free-energy functionals that are difficult to generalize. Here we introduce a physics-informed learning framework that augments cDFT with neural corrections trained directly against molecular-dynamics data through adjoint optimization. Rather than replacing the theory with a black-box surrogate, we embed compact neural networks within the Helmholtz free-energy functional, learning local and nonlocal corrections that preserve thermodynamic consistency while capturing missing correlations. Applied to Lennard-Jones fluids, the resulting augmented excess free-energy functional quantitatively reproduces equilibrium density profiles, coexistence curves, and surface tensions across a broad temperature range, and accurately predicts contact angles and droplet shapes far beyond the training regime. This approach combines the interpretability of statistical mechanics with the adaptability of modern machine learning, establishing a general route to learned thermodynamic functionals that bridge molecular simulations and continuum-scale models.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23840v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] CASCADE: Cumulative Agentic Skill Creation through Autonomous Development and Evolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23880</link><description>arXiv:2512.23880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents currently depend on predefined tools or brittle tool generation, constraining their capability and adaptability to complex scientific tasks. We introduce CASCADE, a self-evolving agentic framework representing an early instantiation of the transition from "LLM + tool use" to "LLM + skill acquisition". CASCADE enables agents to master complex external tools and codify knowledge through two meta-skills: continuous learning via web search and code extraction, and self-reflection via introspection and knowledge graph exploration, among others. We evaluate CASCADE on SciSkillBench, a benchmark of 116 materials science and chemistry research tasks. CASCADE achieves a 93.3% success rate using GPT-5, compared to 35.4% without evolution mechanisms. We further demonstrate real-world applications in computational analysis, autonomous laboratory experiments, and selective reproduction of published papers. Along with human-agent collaboration and memory consolidation, CASCADE accumulates executable skills that can be shared across agents and scientists, moving toward scalable AI-assisted scientific research.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23880v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Assessment of First-Principles Methods in Modeling the Melting Properties of Water</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23940</link><description>arXiv:2512.23940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-principles simulations have played a crucial role in deepening our understanding of the thermodynamic properties of water, and machine learning potentials (MLPs) trained on these first-principles data widen the range of accessible properties. However, the capabilities of different first-principles methods are not yet fully understood due to the lack of systematic benchmarks, the underestimation of the uncertainties introduced by MLPs, and the neglect of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs). Here, we systematically assess first-principles methods by calculating key melting properties using path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) driven by Deep Potential (DP) models trained on data from density functional theory (DFT) with SCAN, revPBE0-D3, SCAN0 and revPBE-D3 functionals, as well as from the MB-pol potential. We find that MB-pol is in qualitatively good agreement with the experiment in all properties tested, whereas the four DFT functionals incorrectly predict that NQEs increase the melting temperature. SCAN and SCAN0 slightly underestimate the density change between water and ice upon melting, but revPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 severely underestimate it. Moreover, SCAN and SCAN0 correctly predict that the maximum liquid density occurs at a temperature higher than the melting point, while revPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 predict the opposite behavior. Our results highlight limitations in widely used first-principles methods and call for a reassessment of their predictive power in aqueous systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23940v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Testing Noise Correlations by an AI-Assisted Two-Qubit Quantum Sensor</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24135</link><description>arXiv:2512.24135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and validate a machine learning-assisted protocol to classify time and space correlations of classical noise acting on a quantum system, using two interacting qubits as probe. We consider different classes of noise, according to their Markovianity and spatial correlations. Leveraging the sensitivity of a coherent population transfer protocol under three distinct driving conditions, the various noises are discriminated by only measuring the final transfer efficiencies. This approach reaches around 90% accuracy with a minimal experimental overhead.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24135v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Unsupervised Topological Phase Discovery in Periodically Driven Systems via Floquet-Bloch State</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24822</link><description>arXiv:2512.24822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floquet engineering offers an unparalleled platform for realizing novel non-equilibrium topological phases. However, the unique structure of Floquet systems, which includes multiple quasienergy gaps, poses a significant challenge to classification using conventional analytical methods. We propose a novel unsupervised machine learning framework that employs a kernel defined in momentum-time ($\boldsymbol{k},t$) space, constructed directly from Floquet-Bloch eigenstates. This approach is intrinsically data-driven and requires no prior knowledge of the underlying topological invariants, providing a fundamental advantage over prior methods that rely on abstract concepts like the micromotion operator or homotopic transformations. Crucially, this work successfully reveals the intrinsic topological characteristics encoded within the Floquet eigenstates themselves. We demonstrate that our method robustly and simultaneously identifies the topological invariants associated with both the $0$-gap and the $\pi$-gap across various symmetry classes (1D AIII, 1D D, and 2D A), establishing a robust methodology for the systematic classification and discovery of complex non-equilibrium topological matter.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24822v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dynamic breaking of axial symmetry of acoustic waves in crystals as the origin of nonlinear elasticity and chaos: Analytical model and MD simulations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04175</link><description>arXiv:2510.04175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Chain of Springs and Masses (CSM) model is used in the interpretation of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of movement of atoms in orientated FCC crystals. A force of dynamic origin is found that is perpendicular to the direction of the external shear pressure. It is proportional to the square of the applied pressure; It causes breaking of axial symmetry for propagation of transverse acoustic waves. It leads to a non-linear elastic response of crystals and to chaotic patterns in the motion of atoms. We provide an analytical derivation of an effective atomistic 3D potential for interaction between crystallographic layers. The potential is found to possess a component that has an anharmonic threefold axial symmetry around one direction. It reduces to the H{\'e}non-Heinen potential in a 2D cross-section, leading to mathematically rich, complex dynamic features. Results of simulation predict displacements of atoms that are inconsistent with the static theory of elasticity that may have been overlooked in experiments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.04175v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] GoodRegressor: A General-Purpose Symbolic Regression Framework for Physically Interpretable Materials Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18325</link><description>arXiv:2510.18325v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symbolic regression offers a promising route toward interpretable machine learning, yet existing methods suffer from poor predictability and computational intractability when exploring large expression spaces. I introduce GoodRegressor, a general-purpose C++-based framework that resolves these limitations while preserving full physical interpretability. By combining hierarchical descriptor construction, interaction discovery, nonlinear transformations, statistically rigorous model selection, and stacking ensemble, GoodRegressor efficiently explores symbolic model spaces such as $1.44 \times 10^{457}$, $5.99 \times 10^{124}$, and $4.20 \times 10^{430}$ possible expressions for oxygen-ion conductors, NASICONs, and superconducting oxides, respectively. Across these systems, it produces compact equations that surpass state-of-the-art black-box models and symbolic regressors, improving $R^2$ by $4 \sim 40$ %. The resulting expressions reveal physical insights, for example, into oxygen-ion transport through coordination environment and lattice flexibility. Independent ensemble runs yield nearly identical regressed values and the identical top-ranked candidate, demonstrating high reproducibility. With scalability up to $10^{4392}$ choices without interaction terms, GoodRegressor provides a foundation for general-purpose interpretable machine intelligence.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.18325v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Thermodynamic Phase Stability, Structural, Mechanical, Optoelectronic, and Thermoelectric Properties of the III-V Semiconductor AlSb for Energy Conversion Applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22277</link><description>arXiv:2512.22277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a first principles investigation of the structural, thermodynamic, electronic, optical and thermoelectric properties of aluminum antimonide (AlSb) in its cubic (F-43m) and hexagonal (P63mc) phases. Both structures are dynamically and mechanically stable, as confirmed by phonon calculations and the Born Huang criteria. The lattice constants obtained using the SCAN and PBEsol functionals show good agreement with experimental data. The cubic phase exhibits a direct band gap of 1.66 to 1.78 eV, while the hexagonal phase shows a band gap of 1.48 to 1.59 eV, as confirmed by mBJ and HSE06 calculations. Under external pressure, the band gap decreases in the cubic phase and increases in the hexagonal phase due to different s p orbital hybridization mechanisms. The optical absorption coefficient reaches 1e6 cm-1, which is comparable to or higher than values reported for other III V semiconductors. The Seebeck coefficient exceeds 1500 microV per K under intrinsic conditions, and the thermoelectric performance improves above 600 K due to enhanced phonon scattering and lattice anharmonicity. The calculated formation energies (-1.316 eV for F-43m and -1.258 eV for P63mc) confirm that the cubic phase is thermodynamically more stable. The hexagonal phase exhibits higher anisotropy and lower lattice stiffness, which is favorable for thermoelectric applications. These results demonstrate the strong interplay between crystal symmetry, phonon behavior and charge transport, and provide useful guidance for the design of AlSb based materials for optoelectronic and energy conversion technologies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22277v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] CrystalDiT: A Diffusion Transformer for Crystal Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16614</link><description>arXiv:2508.16614v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present CrystalDiT, a diffusion transformer for crystal structure generation that achieves state-of-the-art performance by challenging the trend of architectural complexity. Instead of intricate, multi-stream designs, CrystalDiT employs a unified transformer that imposes a powerful inductive bias: treating lattice and atomic properties as a single, interdependent system. Combined with a periodic table-based atomic representation and a balanced training strategy, our approach achieves 8.78% SUN (Stable, Unique, Novel) rate on MP-20, substantially outperforming recent methods including FlowMM (4.21%) and MatterGen (3.66%). Notably, CrystalDiT generates 63.28% unique and novel structures while maintaining comparable stability rates, demonstrating that architectural simplicity can be more effective than complexity for materials discovery. Our results suggest that in data-limited scientific domains, carefully designed simple architectures outperform sophisticated alternatives that are prone to overfitting.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.16614v3</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

It implies numerous proteins and complex molecular mechanisms. The TRIP12 E3 ubiquitin ligase is tightly associated to chromatin and overexpressed in several types of cancers. We explored herein the consequences of TRIP12 overexpression on chromatin homeostasis. We demonstrated that TRIP12 overexpression leads, in a dose-dependent manner, to the formation of chromatin condensates enriched in heterochromatin marks. We delineated within the N-terminal intrinsically disordered region of TRIP12 the region required for condensate formation that involves electrostatic

Anion Exchange Membranes for Water 
Electrolysis to Generate Green Hydrogen</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-5jcw1?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Anion exchange membranes (AEMs) have received a lot of attention in electrochemical energy storage 
and conversion systems and have become a better choice to generate green hydrogen than their proton 
exchange membrane counterparts owing to the non-acidic working conditions as well as the use of nonprecious metal catalytic electrodes. Albeit the safe operating conditions as well as the use of non-precious 
metals, the ion conductivity and technology readiness level of AEMs are significantly lower than their PEM 
counterparts. It is well accepted that the key factors that drive their performance are anion conductivity, 
water uptake and chemical stability. However, there exist several other parameters that influence not 
only the KPI’s but also the overall electrochemical performance of AEMs. The objective of this study is to 
compile the various physical processes in an anion exchange membrane water electrolyser and focus on 
the dominant ones that define the performance of these membranes. We further propose appropriate 
methods to predict the KPIs using multiscale approach. In this report, we elaborately discuss the abovementioned points with a note that, this area still requires substantial research and profound 
understanding from both experimental and computational point of view. In this article, a comprehensive 
review on molecular dynamics simulation methods for anion exchange membranes is extensively 
discussed. We also briefly touch upon the data analytics-based approaches to predict ion conductivity in these
membranes.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-5jcw1?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Revealing amyloid-β peptide isoforms, including post-translationally modified species, using electrochemical profiling with a dual-electrode set-up</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-j5v38?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides are crucial biomarkers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disease. The high diversity of the Aβ family provides a significant challenge for recognizing various Aβ forms, which may differ by a single amino acid or a post-translational modification. Such variation at the N-terminus of Aβ peptides leads to changes in their properties associated with typical AD biomolecular mechanisms, such as aggregation or generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this work, a novel method for discriminating Aβ peptides with physiologically occurring truncations and modifications at their N-termini, based on the electrochemical profiling of their Cu(II) complexes, is presented. A dual-electrode set-up incorporating both glassy carbon and gold electrodes, together with Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV), was employed to generate unique electrochemical profiles, which were subsequently analyzed using chemometric techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for data exploration, and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) for classification. By combining electrochemical measurements with machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition, we successfully differentiated the studied Aβ forms, Aβ1-16, Aβ3-16, Aβpyr3-16, Aβ4-16, Aβ5-16, Aβ11-16, and Aβpyr11-16. The integration of machine learning not only enhances detection accuracy but also identifies subtle patterns that could support early-stage diagnostics. These findings support the ongoing development of analytical strategies that seek to improve the detection range and accuracy of Aβ peptides identification in Alzheimer’s disease research.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-j5v38?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Sensing the Acidity of Hydrogen Bond Networks</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-twv66?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The reactivity of hydrogen bond networks (HBNs) is critical to many chemical and biological scenarios. When the HBNs are under constraint, hydrogen bond strength and acidity are affected significantly. HBNs exhibit cooperativity, where connections formed in one part of the HBN influence its behavior elsewhere. We combined experimental and computational approaches to examine the growth of the HBNs of water and hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), constrained by an aprotic cosolvent. We independently employed vibrational frequency shift of an acetonitrile probe, 1H NMR chemical shift of an aniline probe, and molecular dynamics with machine learning interatomic potentials, to demonstrate the increase in the hydrogen bond strength with the growth of the HBNs. Finally, using vibrational spectroscopy of a titratable probe, we established that not only the hydrogen bond strength, but also the acidity of HFIP is affected by the changes in the network geometry. These results enable the engineering and measurement of HBNs in confined environments with tailored acidity.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-twv66?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Thiol-bearing tertiary alkylammonium chloride for regulation of PbI2 excess in FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-0wscb-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>One of the key strategies for record photovoltaic efficiencies in metal halide perovskite solar cells is the addition of PbI2 excess in a stoichiometric perovskite solution which controls crystallization, passivates defects and induces a preferred orientation in the perovskite layer. However, residual PbI2, typically found in the perovskite layer after crystallization, generates non-radiative recombination centres and promotes ion migration under light and heating stress, thus accelerating performance loss. To mitigate the above issues, a common strategy is the post-deposition of organic ammonium salts which interact in situ with residual PbI2. Here, we adopt a multifunctional alkylammonium salt, 2-diethylaminoethanethiol hydrochloride (DEAET), in which both the thiol (–SH) and protonated tertiary amine groups can strongly bind to PbI₂. Upon deposition of DEAET on top of FAPbI3 film, we show that DEAT decreases the percentage of residual PbI2 by 40% and totally eliminates Pb0. These two effects lead to enhanced radiative recombination, proving a net passivation effect, while chemical analysis (FTIR and liquid-state NMR) explains that this is due to strong interactions between tertiary protonated ammonium (-NH+) and thiol (-SH) groups of DEAT with under-coordinated Pb2+. The stabilization of FAPbI3 black phase along with the establishment of a solid barrier to impede the infiltration of moisture into the perovskite layer over time lead to enhanced operational stability for the as-fabricated solar cells. The encouraging findings of this study lay the foundation for the utilization of tertiary ammonium thiol-based salts as efficient agents for interface engineering in perovskite solar cells.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-0wscb-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] LAMMPS-ANI: Large Scale Molecular Dynamics Simulations

in-depth performance profiling, and advanced GPU performance optimizations. Our benchmarks show
that ANI is 30 to 60 times faster than the state-of-the-art Allegro Model, emphasizing its speed and

Mezzacappa and M. Zanolin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The observation of a core collapse supernova explosion of (near-)Galactic origin would constitute a landmark, once-in-a-century event for multimessenger astronomy, eagerly awaited by observers and modelers alike. The detection of gravitational waves, along with photons and neutrinos, from such an event would provide unique insights into the supernova central engine and the physics of the newly forming neutron star. This Colloquium presents the latest progress in core collapse supernova modeling and the associated gravitational wave signal predictions. It also provides an overview of the specific methods of detection and physical parameter estimation that can be implemented for such signals in ground-based laser interferometers, in the context of multimessenger research strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height="" src="https://cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/RMP/key_images/10.1103/pv6p-dtr2.png" width="200" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Rev.

We compare seven reasoning LLMs using a testbench of 102 design descriptions that ranged from single devices to 112-component PICs. The success rate for single-device designs was up to 91%. For design queries with ≤15 components, o1, Gemini-2.5-pro, and Claude Opus 4 achieved the highest end-to-end pass@5 success rates of ∼57%, with Gemini-2.5-pro requiring the fewest output tokens and the lowest cost.

In this work, the phonon dynamics, carrier transport, and TE performance of the layered SmZnSbO compound are comprehensively evaluated using first-principles calculations, machine learning interatomic potentials, Boltzmann transport theory, and the two-channel model. The coexistence of weak interlayer van der Waals interactions, robust intralayer covalent bonding interactions, and rattling-like vibrations of Zn atoms synergistically induces significant lattice anharmonicity, resulting in a decreased lattice thermal conductivity (0.84 W/mK@900 K within the framework of the two-channel model) for the SmZnSbO compound. The natural quantum well architecture formed by the alternative conductive [Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; layer and the insulated [Sm&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; layer endows quasi-two-dimensional transport characteristics, enabling a high carrier mobility of 34.1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/Vs. Moreover, the multi-valley electronic band structure with an indirect bandgap of 0.80 eV simultaneously optimizes electrical conductivity (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;σ&lt;/span&gt;) and Seebeck coefficient (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;), resulting in an enhanced power factor. Benefiting from these synergistic features, the layered SmZnSbO compound achieves optimal dimensionless figures of merit (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;ZT&lt;/span&gt;s) of 1.47 and 1.40 for the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;-type and &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;-type doping circumstances at 900 K. The current work not only elucidates the thermal and electronic transport mechanisms for the SmZnSbO compound but also establishes a paradigm for designing high-efficiency layered oxide TE materials through combined strategies of quantum confinement, phonon engineering, and multi-valley band convergence.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/26/261902/3375853/Rattling-induced-anharmonicity-and-multi-valley</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Magneto-ionic control of perpendicular anisotropy in epitaxial Mn 4 N films</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/26/262405/3375847/Magneto-ionic-control-of-perpendicular-anisotropy</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;We report reversible control of the magnetism and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) in Mn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N thin films through solid-state magneto-ionic gating.

We demonstrate that the interfacial anisotropy can be reversibly tuned through voltage-driven nitrogen ion migration when Mn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N is in contact with a nitrogen-affine metal, such as Ta and V. We also show that solid-state gating effectively enhances the spin–orbit torque switching efficiency by reducing the coercive field without compromising the interface transparency.

Through comprehensive first-principles thermodynamic calculations and hierarchical ion-transport algorithms, the phase stability, electrochemical stability, chemical stability, ionic transport, Li wettability, and mechanical properties of the candidate materials were systematically predicted and analyzed. Results indicate that the candidate coatings are thermodynamically stable at 0 K, with superior reduction stability against the lithium metal anode and good chemical compatibility with LLZO.

Routine alcohol-based cleaning can be impractical on high-touch optical surfaces due to damage risk and usability concerns. Here, we present a scalable approach to transparent, mechanically robust glass surfaces by embedding materials with &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;ad hoc&lt;/span&gt; functionality into surface glass nanoholes. We demonstrate the concept with copper nanodisks: copper is an established antimicrobial agent, but its wear susceptibility pose challenges for use on transparent displays. Our design shields the functional material from lateral wear while allowing ion diffusion for antimicrobial efficacy. Fabrication uses only wafer-compatible, lithography-free steps: thermal dewetting of a thin silver film to create a nanosized mask; inverting it to a polymer nanoholes mask by etching the silver nanoparticles; wet etching of the glass to form nanoholes; selective copper deposition inside these holes; and liftoff of excess material. The resulting surfaces exhibit mean transmission of 80%–85% in the 380–750 nm range with haze &amp;lt;1% and minimal color shift, compared to uncoated glass. Antimicrobial efficacy, assessed against &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/span&gt; OP50 under a modified U.S. EPA protocol, shows ≈99% bacterial reduction within one hour. Abrasion tests with a crockmeter simulating finger swipes confirm that the embedded copper remains intact, with no measurable change in optical performance. This embedded design provides a scalable route to integrate antimicrobial functionality into high-touch transparent systems while preserving optical clarity and wear resistance, with potential relevance for medical, consumer, and transportation interfaces.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Materials Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apm/article/13/12/121112/3375772/Lithography-free-fabrication-of-transparent</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Augmenting Large Language Models for Automated Discovery of f-Element Extractants</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-b1m2q-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Efficient separation of f-elements is a critical challenge for a wide range of emerging technologies. The chemical similarity among these elements makes the development of selective solvent extraction reagents both slow and difficult. Here, we present a quasi-autonomous, AI-enabled workflow for the design and computational screening of selective extractant ligands. Molecular design is guided by SAFE-MolGen, a large language model-based agentic system that leverages curated extraction data to propose new ligands and preliminarily rank their performance using a supervised machine learning model trained on experimental datasets to consider the impact of realistic experimental conditions. Promising human-approved ligands are then passed to a second automated pipeline that constructs three-dimensional metal-ligand complexes and performs quantum mechanical free energy calculations to directly assess metal selectivity. We demonstrate this approach for Am(III)/Eu(III) separations and report several newly designed ligands predicted to exhibit higher Am(III)/Eu(III) selectivity than the benchmark extractant CyMe4BTBP. This workflow accelerates computational exploration of the molecular space in this data-sparse field and provides a general strategy for the rapid generation and evaluation of novel lanthanide (Ln) and actinide (An) extractants.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-b1m2q-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

We conducted the first systematic analysis of prokaryotic SPs across the full ocean-depth gradient. From 433,311 small open reading frames (sORFs) predicted from 71 western Pacific metagenomes, we identified 193,281 SP clusters. Filtration yielded 75,581 prevalent SPs, including 4,307 high-confidence clusters (RfSPs). Notably, 87.09% of RfSPs lacked non-marine homologs, and ∼70% contained unknown domains. While most (65.57%) were phylum-specific, twelve were distributed across ≥5 phyla, and some were prophage-associated.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02846-9?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Exploring neglected places enabling conservation crime through place network investigations</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02645-8?rss=yes</link><description>Earth sciences; Environmental science; Ecology; Social sciences; Research methodology social sciences</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02645-8?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

While recent advances in robotic droplet imaging have facilitated the collection of such datasets, experimental acquisition remains a key bottleneck. Here, we explore whether synthetic image generation can supplement or replace real data in the context of salt classification. Using Stable Diffusion with low-rank adaptation, we generate 133 000 synthetic images from as few as &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 1–128 experimental images per salt across seven common inorganic solutes. Synthetic images become visually indistinguishable from real ones for &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; ≥ 6; however, quantitative analysis based on 47 image metrics reveals subtle differences that vanish around &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 128. When used to train random forest, XGBoost, and multilayer perceptron (MLP) models, synthetic data alone achieve classification accuracies of up to 90% in some low-data regimes. Synthetic augmentation offers a powerful strategy for expanding training sets and enabling image-based chemical classification in data-scarce scenarios, even if it seldom outperforms models trained on real data. The realism of synthetic images also highlights the growing need for tools that detect AI-generated scientific images to ensure data integrity.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Machine Learning Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/aml/article/3/4/046112/3375778/Synthetic-images-from-generative-AI-for</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] An Interpretable Machine Learning Model for Predicting the Effectiveness of Low-Dose Methylprednisolone in Treating Long COVID: A Retrospective Study</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02835-4?rss=yes</link><description>Long COVID is a chronic, multisystem disease with limited response to conventional treatments. While low-dose methylprednisolone has shown effectiveness in some patients, individual responses vary, and accurate predictive tools are lacking. This retrospective study included 330 Long COVID patients who received low-dose methylprednisolone treatment across three hospitals. Patients were divided into training (n=202), test (n=33), and external validation sets (n=53, n=42). Using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression, 38 variables were analyzed to develop six machine learning models.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02835-4?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] River plastic hotspot detection from space</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02831-7?rss=yes</link><description>Plastic pollution threatens terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and rivers play a central role in transporting and retaining plastics across landscapes. Effective mitigation requires scalable methods to identify riverine plastic accumulation hotspots. Here, we present a semi-automated, cloud-based pipeline that integrates satellite remote sensing and machine learning to detect river plastic hotspots. High-resolution PlanetScope imagery is used to annotate training regions, which are transferred to Sentinel-2 multispectral data to train Random Forest classifiers within Google Earth Engine.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02831-7?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] An exploration of dataset bias in single-step retrosynthesis prediction</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00358J</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, Accepted Manuscript&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00358J, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Fernanda Duarte, Sara Tanovic, Ewa Wieczorek&lt;br /&gt;Single-step retrosynthesis models are integral to the development of computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) tools, leveraging past reaction data to generate new synthetic pathways.

The microbiome is increasingly recognized as a key modulator of antiviral immunity but whether it shapes immune responses in upper airway remains uncharacterized. Detailed microbial profiles revealed that S. aureus complex abundance was the primary discriminating factor of microbial community in the NP and the enhanced abundance of S. aureus complex correlated with higher frequencies of CD4+, CD8+ tissue-resident memory T (TRM), and BRM cells.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02840-8?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Polarization-Diversity Backscatter Communication Based on Programmable Information Metasurface</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02838-X?rss=yes</link><description>Backscatter communication (BC) is a low-power technology that transmits data by reflecting ambient RF signals. Conventional BC, based on antenna impedance modulation, suffers from low data rates and poor interference resistance. Programmable information metasurface (IMS) offer a breakthrough by enabling precise wave control. This paper presents a PIN-diode-based IMS for polarization-diversity backscatter transmission. It performs full-space secondary modulation, converting horizontally polarized incident waves into ±45° polarized signals.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02838-X?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Synthetic zipper mediated pre-targeting system for Near-infrared photoimmunotherapy</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02819-6?rss=yes</link><description>Strategies have gained attraction in cancer diagnosis and therapy, particularly to overcome the limitations associated with direct targeting approaches in radioimmunotherapy and photoimmunotherapy. Here, we have introduced a synthetic zipper-mediated pre-targeting system for Near-infrared photoimmunotherapy (NIR-PIT) utilizing the IR700-conjugated Zip1-SNAP protein in combination with three scFv-ZIP2 fusion proteins targeting FOLR1, TROP2 and TF. In this two-step targeting approach, scFv-Zip2 proteins first bind to cancer-specific antigens, followed by hybridization with Zip1-SNAP-IR700 at cell surface via high-affinity zipper interaction.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02819-6?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Syndrome (LFS) is characterized by constitutional pathogenic TP53 mutation and increased risk of cancer development, including Sonic Hedgehog-activated medulloblastoma (SHH-MB). In LFS patients, radiation and DNA-damaging agents can exhibit lower efficiency and cause secondary malignancies. To identify efficacious, safe chemotherapeutic approaches for LFS-associated SHH-MB, 333 compounds were screened in in vitro TP53mut brain tumor cell lines. The combination of WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib and vinca alkaloid vincristine demonstrated the highest activity, which was validated in TP53mut SHH-MB patient-derived organoids.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02825-1?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Multiple groups of neurons in the superior colliculus convert value signals into saccadic vigor</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02824-X?rss=yes</link><description>Eye movements toward high-valued objects are executed with greater vigor. To test how neurons in the Superior Colliculus (SC), a subcortical structure that controls these movements, are modulated by value, we recorded four SC neuron subtypes while monkeys made saccades to objects previously associated with high or low reward volumes. High-value objects elicited greater activity in three neuron subtypes (visual, visuomotor, motor). Using a bootstrapping method, we identified three distinct activity phases: early visual response (EVIS), late visual response (LVIS), and pre-saccadic (PreSAC) motor response.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02824-X?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Database of Recurrent Mutations (DORM), an unbiased web resource to browse recurrent mutations in cancers</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02822-6?rss=yes</link><description>Existing cancer-associated variant databases contain biases arising from duplicate entries and the inclusion of targeted sequencing panels, which interfere with accurate estimation somatic mutation frequency in cancer cohorts. To address this, we developed the Database of Recurrent Mutations (DORM), a web resource derived exclusively from whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing data. By filtering out targeted screens and non-recurrent variants, our analysis reveals that mutation recurrence significantly correlates with oncogenic activity, loss of tumor suppressor function, and unfavorable patient prognosis.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid

In this study, we use pre- and post-season resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) to examine whether concussion during a season of football is related to changes in neurophysiology and whether any such changes are associated with clinical outcomes. Concussion was associated with increased aperiodic exponents in superior frontal cortices, indicating a relative reduction in cortical excitability, which accounted for effects on raw delta and gamma power and was associated with worse cognitive concerns across participants.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02836-6?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] CK1δ-Dependent SNAPIN Dysregulation Drives Lysosomal Failure in HIV-1 Vpr–Exposed Neurons: A Targetable Mechanism in HAND</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02805-6?rss=yes</link><description>HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND) persist in nearly 40% of virally suppressed individuals despite AntiRetroviral Therapy (ART). Lysosomal dysfunction has emerged as a key contributor to HAND pathogenesis, yet the molecular mechanisms linking chronic HIV exposure to impaired neuronal degradation remain incompletely defined. Here, we identify HIV-1 Viral Protein R (Vpr) as a driver of lysosomal acidification failure, clustering, and degradative impairment in neurons. We report Casein Kinase 1 delta (CK1δ) as a central mediator of this dysfunction, acting via phosphorylation of the adaptor protein SNAPIN.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02805-6?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

We conducted a longitudinal cohort study with 5,838,833 participants enrolled between 2019 and 2021. Region-specific Cox models assessed long-term PM2.5 exposure and CVD incidence. A 1 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with a 0.5% higher CVD risk (HR: 1.005; 95% CI: 1.005–1.006). Moderate and high exposure levels corresponded to HRs of 1.280 (95% CI: 1.255–1.306) and 1.373 (95% CI: 1.340–1.406).</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 00:00:00

The transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel has been implicated in neurodegenerative processes, but its contribution to cognitive variation in PD remains unclear. This study aimed to determine whether TRPV1 genetic variants influence cognitive performance and whether these effects are moderated by PD status. Three TRPV1 polymorphisms (rs8065080, rs12936340, rs182637) were genotyped in 274 healthy controls and 127 individuals with PD.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02799-3?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Identity rather than 3D position informs splicing of rare introns in the human genome</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02793-2?rss=yes</link><description>Three-dimensional genome organization influences splicing, yet how introns, particularly rare introns, are arranged within the nucleus and whether this organization contributes to splicing has not been fully explored. We mapped the organization of six intron classes, major, minor, minor-like, hybrid, major-like and non-canonical, across four human cell lines using Hi-C, TSA-seq, and DamID-seq. Minor intron-containing genes (MIGs) and their introns were enriched in compartment A and speckle-associated domains (SPADs) and depleted from lamina-associated domains.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02793-2?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[Cell Reports Physical Science] Bio-inspired biped microwalker with magneto-acoustic actuation for cell manipulation</title><link>https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-physical-science/fulltext/S2666-3864(25)00632-0?rss=yes</link><description>Cherukumilli et al. present a bio-inspired bipedal microwalker that can be actuated by magnetic and acoustic fields for locomotion.

However, their reported lattice thermal conductivities ( κ) remain highly inconsistent, with experimental values and theoretical predictions differing by more than an order of magnitude. These discrepancies stem from uncertainties in measurement techniques, variations in computational protocols, and ambiguities in the treatment of higher-order anharmonic processes. In this study, we critically review these inconsistencies, first by mapping the spread of experimental and modeling results, and then by identifying the methodological origins of divergence. To this end, we bridge first-principles calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and state-of-the-art machine learning force fields (MLFFs), including recently developed foundation models. We train and benchmark GAP, MACE, NEP, and HIPHIVE against density functional theory and rigorously evaluate the impact of third- and fourth-order phonon scattering processes on  κ. The computational efficiency of MLFFs enables us to extend convergence tests beyond conventional limits and to validate predictions through homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular dynamics as well. Our analysis demonstrates that, contrary to some recent claims, fully converged four-phonon processes contribute negligibly to the intrinsic thermal conductivity of both MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. These findings not only refine the intrinsic transport limits of 2D TMDs but also establish MLFF-based approaches as a robust and scalable framework for predictive modeling of phonon-mediated thermal transport in low-dimensional materials.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041424/3375425/Thermal-conductivity-limits-of-MoS2-and-MoSe2</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Widely Targeted Metabolomics and Machine Learning Identify Succinate as a Key Metabolite in Sepsis-Associated Encephalopathy</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02781-6?rss=yes</link><description>Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a common and serious complication of sepsis that leads to acute brain dysfunction and long-term cognitive impairment. We used widely targeted LC–MS/MS plasma metabolomics in 29 healthy controls, 32 sepsis patients, and 27 SAE patients, combined with machine learning, to define metabolic patterns across these groups.
