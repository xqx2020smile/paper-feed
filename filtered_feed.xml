Abstract: We investigate superconductivity in KTaO$_3$ (KTO)-based two-dimensional electron gases for the (001), (110), and (111) crystallographic orientations within a unified microscopic framework. Using a self-consistent tight-binding slab model, we determine the confinement potential, electronic structure, and orbital composition for each orientation, explicitly including inversion-symmetry-induced orbital Rashba couplings. Using a local spin-singlet s-wave pairing interaction, we find that the pronounced orientation dependence of the superconducting critical temperature primarily originates from differences in the spatial extent of the two-dimensional electron gas and the associated redistribution of the density of states at the Fermi level, rather than from changes in the pairing interaction. Our results provide a microscopic explanation for the experimentally observed orientation dependence of superconductivity at KTO-based interfaces.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.22316v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Enhancement of superconductivity by disorder in Remeika-type quasiskutterudites</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22448</link><description>arXiv:2602.22448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic-scale disorder is conventionally regarded as detrimental to superconductivity; however, under specific conditions, it can enhance superconducting properties. Here, we investigate the role of substitutional disorder in Remeika-type quasiskutterudites $R_3M_4$Sn$_{13}$ and $R_5M_6$Sn$_{18}$ ($R=$ Y, La, Lu; $M=$ Co, Rh, Ru) by combining measurements of magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity, and heat capacity with microscopic modeling. We demonstrate that increasing disorder leads to the emergence of locally superconducting regions characterized by an enhanced critical temperature $T_c^{\ast}$, exceeding the bulk transition temperature $T_c$.
  Both $T_c^\ast$ and $T_c$ exhibit a nonmonotonic dependence on dopant concentration and show a strong correlation with entropy isotherms measured as a function of disorder. The pronounced entropy maxima coincide with the largest separation between $T_c^{\ast}$ and $T_c$, establishing disorder as a thermodynamically controlled parameter governing superconductivity in these materials. Measurements of the upper critical field reveal distinct $H_{c2}(T)$ branches associated with the bulk and locally superconducting phases, providing direct experimental evidence for a percolative superconducting state.
  To interpret these observations, we propose a microscopic model that captures the interplay between the impurity-induced enhancement of local pairing and the disorder-driven suppression of global superconducting coherence. The model reproduces the experimentally observed nonmonotonic evolution of $T_c^{\ast}$ with disorder and supports a percolation-based interpretation of the superconducting transition. Our results demonstrate that controlled atomic disorder can serve as an effective materials-design parameter for tuning superconductivity in complex correlated systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.22448v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Symmetry-enforced agreement of Kohn--Sham and many-body Berry phases in the SSH--Hubbard chain</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22578</link><description>arXiv:2602.22578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study when a density-matching Kohn--Sham (KS) description can reproduce a many-body Berry phase in a correlated insulator, despite the fact that geometric phases are functionals of the wave function. Focusing on the one-dimensional SSH--Hubbard chain on a ring as a controlled interacting topological model, we introduce a $U(1)$ twist $\theta$ (flux insertion). The many-body ground state along the full twist cycle is computed by the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG), while the onsite interaction $U$ is tuned from the noninteracting to the strong-coupling regime. At half filling in the inversion-symmetric gapped regime, our DMRG calculations show that the density remains constant within numerical accuracy over the entire $(\theta,U)$ range studied. Thus, the density has no dependence on either the flux $\theta$ or the interaction strength $U$. Accordingly, the symmetry-preserving density constraint collapses the KS reference to an SSH-type quadratic representative with $U$-independent geometric diagnostics. Nevertheless, the many-body wave function exhibits a nontrivial geometric response: the quantum metric associated with the $\theta$-parametrized ground-state manifold depends on $\theta$ at intermediate $U$ and is strongly suppressed at large $U$, consistent with the charge fluctuation freezing. Intriguingly, the KS and many-body Berry phases coincide throughout the gapped regime as $U$ is tuned from weak to strong coupling. We show that this agreement is best understood as symmetry-enforced $\mathbb{Z}_2$ sector matching, rather than as evidence that the density encodes the many-body Berry connection.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.22578v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Surface-localized topological superconductivity in nodal-loop materials: BdG analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22837</link><description>arXiv:2602.22837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study surface superconductivity in a nodal-line semimetal by combining a minimal tight-binding model with a layer-resolved Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach. In the normal state, the model realizes a bulk nodal loop and an associated drumhead surface band in a slab geometry with open boundaries in the $z$ direction: the central layers reproduce the bulk-like density of states, whereas the surface layer exhibits a sharp zero-energy peak originating from the drumhead states. On top of this band structure we introduce chiral $p$-wave and $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconducting channels and determine the layer-dependent gap amplitudes self-consistently. The chiral $p$-wave order parameter is strongly enhanced at the outermost layers and decays within only a few layers towards the interior, while the $d$-wave order parameter is more than an order of magnitude smaller on all layers. The quasiparticle dispersion and surface local density of states in the chiral $p$-wave state show that the drumhead band is efficiently gapped out and that the zero-energy peak in the normal surface spectrum is split into two coherence peaks, directly reflecting the induced superconducting gap. These results demonstrate that superconductivity driven by drumhead surface states is naturally biased toward a surface-localized chiral $p$-wave pairing symmetry and may offer qualitative guidance for interpreting surface-sensitive experiments on Pd-doped CaAgP.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.22837v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Substrate induced optimization of the Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) performances of MoS2 thin film</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22869</link><description>arXiv:2602.22869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has emerged as a promising, cost-effective catalyst for hydrogen production via water splitting. We investigate the structural and electrocatalytic properties of MoS2 thin films deposited on different substrates (Al2O3, SiC, STO) to study their hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. In particular, in order to study the substrate influence on the stabilization of different polymorphic MoS2 phases, the films are synthesised using pulsed laser deposition on substrates with different crystal symmetries and lattice parameters. All the deposited samples are characterized by X-Ray Diffraction, Raman Spectroscopy, Linear Sweep Voltammetry and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy analyses. The films grown on Al2O3 substrates exhibit the best HER performance, likely due to the stabilization of the metastable 1T phase through the interfacial interactions between film and substrate. Presence of the 1T phase in the samples grown on Al2O3 improves the charge transfer efficiency and the electrochemically active surface with a better response to the applied potential, demonstrating their enhanced catalytic behaviour for hydrogen evolution.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.22869v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dephasing-induced relaxation in tight-binding chains with linear and nonlinear defects</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22878</link><description>arXiv:2602.22878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate thermalization in a tight-binding chain with an on-site defect subject to local dephasing noise implemented as random phase kicks. For a single linear defect of strength $\epsilon$, we obtain an exact analytical description of the system spectrum and formulate the dephasing-induced dynamics in the eigenstate basis. We derive an approximate kinetic equation for mode populations that describes a continuous-time random walk in action space. The walk transition rates are defined by the overlap matrix encoding the spatial structure of eigenstates that can be computed exactly. Analyzing the spectral properties of the equation, we show that defect-induced localized modes act as bottlenecks that strongly slow down relaxation, with rates scaling as $\epsilon^{-2}$ for strong defects. Using large-deviation theory, we characterize rare dynamical trajectories and identify distinct relaxation pathways associated with low- and high-activity regimes in action space. We provide numerical evidence that the large-deviation function exhibits a dynamical phase transition in the limit $\epsilon \to \infty$. We then extend our analysis to the nonlinear case, considering a single nonlinear defect embedded in either a linear or a fully nonlinear discrete Schr\"odinger equation. Numerical simulations reveal a qualitatively faster approach to equilibrium driven by the amplitude-dependent weakening of the defect. Our results provide a unified framework for understanding thermalization, rare fluctuations, and relaxation pathways in stochastic tight-binding systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.22878v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Mechanistic Insights into Li+ Transport Enabled by Isolated Sulfur Species in Li3PS4 Glasses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22989</link><description>arXiv:2602.22989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-solid-state lithium-ion batteries have renewed interest in high-performance solid electrolytes. Li3PS4 (Li2S-P2S5) glasses are among the most studied due to their high ionic conductivity, traditionally ascribed to rotational motion of polyhedral units facilitating Li+ migration. Using ab initio molecular dynamics, we investigate Li-ion diffusion in Li3PS4 glass, demonstrating that our structural model reproduces experimental neutron and X-ray diffraction patterns and conductivity measurements. Importantly, we identify a previously unrecognized diffusion mechanism: Li+ ions near isolated sulfur species (Sn with n = 1, 3) display significantly enhanced mobility, with atomic displacements up to 1.7 greater than those associated with bulkier polyhedral units. These results highlight the critical role of free sulfur species in promoting fast ionic transport, providing insights for the rational design of glass compositions with optimized conductivity for solid-state battery applications</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.22989v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Tracking the Lithiation State of Li$_x$Si from Machine-Learned XPS Binding Energies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23028</link><description>arXiv:2602.23028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) is a powerful technique to probe chemical states and interfacial processes in battery materials, but a quantitative interpretation is often hindered by the complex, heterogeneous microstructures that form during operation and dominate electrochemical cycling. Silicon based anodes represent a paradigmatic example in Li batteries, as (de)lithiation proceeds through the formation of strongly disordered Li$_x$Si phases and crystal-amorphous transformations that are hard to characterize. Here, we introduce a computational framework that combines machine-learning (ML) prediction of core-level binding energies to large-scale atomistic simulations -- Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) complemented with molecular dynamics (MD), driven by a ML potential -- for a systematic sampling of lithiation states and local atomic environments. This approach yields stoichiometry maps that match the characteristic experimental trends observed in operando and ex situ XPS measurements, including the distinctive Si $2p$ spectroscopic signatures associated with the crystal-to-amorphous disordering driving early delithiation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.23028v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Rheological properties and shear-induced structures of ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23150</link><description>arXiv:2602.23150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently discovered ferroelectric nematic (NF) liquid crystals are fluids with a polar orientational order. The electric polarization vector can be aligned by an electric field and by surface anchoring. Here, we explore how the polarization field and effective viscosity of the NF materials are affected by shear flows. We explore three NF materials, abbreviated RM734, DIO, and a room-temperature FNLC919, all of which exhibit a paraelectric nematic (N) and the NF phase. All materials show an increase of the viscosity upon cooling, with an Arrhenius behavior. In DIO and FNLC919, the antiferroelectric SmZA phase shows a strong dependence of the effective viscosity on the shear rate: this viscosity is lower than the viscosity of the N and NF phases at high shear rates but is much higher when the shear rate is low. The behavior is associated with the layered structure of the SmZA phase. All mesophases exhibit shear-thinning behavior at low shear rates and a nearly Newtonian behavior at higher shear rates. In terms of alignment, we observe three regimes in the N and NF phases: flow-alignment at low shear rates, log-rolling regime with the director and polarization along the vorticity axis at high shear rates, and polydomain structures at intermediate rates. In the flow-aligning regime, the NF polarization does not tilt away from the shear direction, which is in sharp contrast to the flow-induced tilt of the N director. The effect is attributed to the avoidance of splay deformations and associated space charge in the flowing NF. The temperature and shear rate dependencies of the viscosity and the uncovered shear-induced structural effects of NF advance our understanding of these materials and potentially facilitate their applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.23150v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Mesoscopic fluctuation theory of particle systems driven by Poisson noise: study of the $q$-TASEP</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23209</link><description>arXiv:2602.23209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We pursue our study of integrable weak noise theories of directed polymer and interacting particle stochastic models in the 1D KPZ universality class. Here we focus on the $q$-TASEP in either continuous or discrete time. Each particle on $\mathbb{Z}$ jumps independently by $+1$ with a rate (or probability) depending on the gap to the next particle on its right. We consider initial conditions (either step or random) which are empty of particles on $\mathbb{Z}^+$, and focus on the dynamics of the $N$ rightmost particles. In the limit $q \to 1$ and at large time (and large gaps) we identify a new intermediate "mesoscopic" (i.e. finite $N$) regime which corresponds to weak noise. In that regime Poisson noise remains important. We obtain the large deviations of the position of a given particle by two methods. The first derives asymptotics of $q$-TASEP Fredholm determinant formula. The second maps the weak noise limit to a system of semi-discrete or fully discrete, non linear differential equations. These are obtained as saddle point classical equations of a dynamical field theory, and their solutions represent the optimal configurations in the large deviation regime. We show the classical integrability of these two systems, and exhibit their explicit Lax pair. In the case of the continuous time $q$-TASEP it provides the first instance of classical integrability arising in a stochastic system, with signatures of the Poisson noise persisting in the weak noise limit. For this model, we solve the scattering problem associated to its Lax pair and fully characterize the large deviations associated to the weak noise theory. Finally, we supplement this work with an Appendix on the first cumulant method to obtain the large deviations of several lattice polymer models (Strict Weak, Log Gamma, Beta).</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.23209v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Efficient training of generative models from multireference simulations and its application to the design of Dy complexes with large magnetic anisotropy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23230</link><description>arXiv:2602.23230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative machine learning models can potentially provide direct access to novel and relevant portions of the full chemical space, overcoming the cost of systematic sampling. However, the training of these models generally requires a large amount of data, often precluding the use of expensive high-level ab initio simulations for this task. The generation of coordination compounds of Dy with large magnetic anisotropy represents a topical example, where multireference simulations of large molecules are necessary to perform reliable predictions. Here, we show that a semi-supervised chemically-inspired training-by-proxy of generative variational autoencoders can reduce the cost associated with building a training set from multireference simulations by two orders of magnitude. We illustrate the power of this approach by generating 100s of new organic ligands for Dy(III) pentagonal bipyramidal complexes exhibiting record values of magnetic anisotropy, while starting from datasets as small as 1k multireference calculations. This work thus paves the way to the computational generation of molecules as complex coordination compounds with target electronic and magnetic properties.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.23230v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Symmetry-protected control of Liouvillian topological phases via Hamiltonian band topology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22323</link><description>arXiv:2602.22323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a symmetry-protected correspondence between band topology of coherent Hamiltonians and Liouvillian spectral winding in Lindblad descriptions of open quantum systems. This allows the Hamiltonian topology to act as a knob for controlling Liouvillian topology and corresponding non-equilibrium dynamics, rather than being passively manipulated by system-environment exchanges. In particular, by exactly solving the Liouvillian spectrum in a class of one-dimensional dissipative lattices, we find that the Hamiltonian band topology constrains the Liouvillian spectral winding and determines the Liouvillian skin effect, provided the Hamiltonian and quantum jump operators respect the same chiral symmetry. We further demonstrate that lattice parity controls the associated bulk-boundary correspondence and the coherence properties of the steady state. Our results unveil a symmetry-enforced topological control of spectral and spatial organization in open quantum systems, providing a unified perspective on topology in Hamiltonian and dissipative dynamics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.22323v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Symmetric Mass Generation via Multicriticality in a 3D Lattice Gross-Neveu Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23158</link><description>arXiv:2602.23158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a three-dimensional lattice model of two flavors of massless staggered fermions coupled through two independent four-fermion interactions, $U_I$ and $U_B$. Using large-scale fermion-bag Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the phase diagram in the $(U_I, U_B)$ parameter space and identify three distinct phases: a massless fermion phase, a symmetry-broken massive phase, and a symmetric massive phase. When one of the interactions is absent ($U_B=0$), the system undergoes a single continuous transition directly connecting the massless and symmetric massive phases, a feature previously associated with unconventional fermion mass generation. We find that turning on a nonzero $U_B$ separates this direct transition into two successive transitions with an intermediate symmetry-broken phase. The transition from the massless to the broken phase belongs to the Gross-Neveu universality class, while the transition from the broken to the symmetric massive phase falls into the three-dimensional XY universality class. Our results indicate that the special point at vanishing coupling, where the direct transition occurs, plays the role of a multicritical point organizing the surrounding phase structure. These findings provide a unified lattice perspective on conventional and unconventional mechanisms of fermion mass generation within a single model.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.23158v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interaction robustness of the chiral anomaly in Weyl semimetals and Luttinger liquids from a mixed anomaly approach</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09409</link><description>arXiv:2401.09409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chiral anomaly is one of the robust quantum effects in relativistic field theories with a chiral symmetry where charges in chiral sectors appear to be separately conserved. The chiral anomaly, which is often associated with a renormalization-invariant topological term, is a violation of this conservation law due to quantum effects. Such anomalies manifest in Weyl materials as an electromagnetic field-induced transfer of charge between Fermi pockets. However, the emergent nature of the conservation of chiral charge leads to manifestations of the chiral anomaly response that depend on the details of the system such as the strength of interactions. In this paper, we apply an approach where the chiral symmetry in solid materials is replaced by the combination of charge $U(1)$ gauge and spatial translation symmetry. The chiral anomaly in this case is replaced by a mixed anomaly between the two symmetries and the chiral charge can be defined as being proportional to the total momentum. We show that the chiral anomaly associated with this chiral charge is unrenormalized by interactions in contrast to other chiral charges in $(1+1)D$ whose renormalization is regularization dependent. In $(3+1)$D Weyl systems, this chiral anomaly is equivalent to the charge transferred between Fermi surfaces which can be measured through changes in Fermi-surface-enclosed volume. We propose a pump-probe technique to measure this.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2401.09409v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Microwave surface resistance of Tl-1223 films in a dc magnetic field</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15538</link><description>arXiv:2510.15538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present first preliminary surface impedance measurements on Tl-1223 films in dc magnetic fields, in view of potential applications for the next generation Future Circular Collider (FCC-hh) at CERN. The Tl-1223 samples were produced through laser ablation, with nominal thickness of 1 {\mu}m and grown on a thick LaAl2O3 substrate. The presence of Tl-1212 phase identified by XRD and BSE microscopy, could be avoided by changing the oxygen partial pressure during heat treatment. The high-frequency transport properties of the samples were characterized using microwave resonant devices, at fixed frequencies of 14.9 GHz, 24.2 GHz and 26.7 GHz, in the temperature range 40 K to 140 K. An external applied static magnetic field up to 12 T was applied. Samples from subsequent batches exhibited huge improvements in the microwave properties, confirming the progress in the deposition technique.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.15538v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] On the electrical double layer capacitance of the restricted primitive model: a link between the mesoscopic theory and the associative mean spherical approximation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21731</link><description>arXiv:2602.21731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The results for the electrical double layer capacitance and the charge density of ``free ions'' obtained from the mesoscopic theory are compared with the corresponding results of the associative mean spherical approximation.

Abstract: With the continuous growth of neural network scales, low-precision quantization is widely used in edge accelerators. Classic multi-threshold activation hardware requires 2^n thresholds for n-bit outputs, causing a rapid increase in hardware cost as precision increases. We propose a reconfigurable activation hardware, GRAU, based on piecewise linear fitting, where the segment slopes are approximated by powers of two. Our design requires only basic comparators and 1-bit right shifters, supporting mixed-precision quantization and nonlinear functions such as SiLU. Compared with multi-threshold activators, GRAU reduces LUT consumption by over 90%, achieving higher hardware efficiency, flexibility, and scalability.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.22352v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] EvolveGen: Algorithmic Level Hardware Model Checking Benchmark Generation through Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22609</link><description>arXiv:2602.22609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Progress in hardware model checking depends critically on high-quality benchmarks. However, the community faces a significant benchmark gap: existing suites are limited in number, often distributed only in representations such as BTOR2 without access to the originating register-transfer-level (RTL) designs, and biased toward extreme difficulty where instances are either trivial or intractable. These limitations hinder rigorous evaluation of new verification techniques and encourage overfitting of solver heuristics to a narrow set of problems. To address this, we introduce EvolveGen, a framework for generating hardware model checking benchmarks by combining reinforcement learning (RL) with high-level synthesis (HLS). Our approach operates at an algorithmic level of abstraction in which an RL agent learns to construct computation graphs. By compiling these graphs under different synthesis directives, we produce pairs of functionally equivalent but structurally distinct hardware designs, inducing challenging model checking instances. Solver runtime is used as the reward signal, enabling the agent to autonomously discover and generate small-but-hard instances that expose solver-specific weaknesses. Experiments show that EvolveGen efficiently creates a diverse benchmark set in standard formats (e.g., AIGER and BTOR2) and effectively reveals performance bottlenecks in state-of-the-art model checkers.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.22609v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Bitwise Systolic Array Architecture for Runtime-Reconfigurable Multi-precision Quantized Multiplication on Hardware Accelerators</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23334</link><description>arXiv:2602.23334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network accelerators have been widely applied to edge devices for complex tasks like object tracking, image recognition, etc. Previous works have explored the quantization technologies in related lightweight accelerator designs to reduce hardware resource consumption. However, low precision leads to high accuracy loss in inference. Therefore, mixed-precision quantization becomes an alternative solution by applying different precision in different layers to trade off resource consumption and accuracy. Because regular designs for multiplication on hardware cannot support the precision reconfiguration for a multi-precision Quantized Neural Network (QNN) model in runtime, we propose a runtime reconfigurable multi-precision multi-channel bitwise systolic array design for QNN accelerators. We have implemented and evaluated our work on the Ultra96 FPGA platform. Results show that our work can achieve 1.3185 to 3.5671 times speedup in inferring mixed-precision models and has less critical path delay, supporting a higher clock frequency (250MHz).</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.23334v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Real-Time Stream Compaction for Sparse Machine Learning on FPGAs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23281</link><description>arXiv:2602.23281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning algorithms are being used more frequently in the first-level triggers in collider experiments, with Graph Neural Networks pushing the hardware requirements of FPGA-based triggers beyond the current state of the art. To meet the stringent demands of high-throughput and low-latency environments, we propose a concept for latency-optimized preprocessing of sparse sensor data, enabling efficient GNN hardware acceleration by removing dynamic input sparsity. Our approach rearranges data coming from a large number of First-In-First-Out interfaces, typically sensor frontends, to a smaller number of FIFO interfaces connected to a machine learning hardware accelerator. In order to achieve high throughput while minimizing the hardware utilization, we developed a hierarchical sparsity compression pipeline optimized for FPGAs. We implemented our concept in the Chisel design language as an open-source hardware generator. For demonstration, we implemented one configuration of our module as preprocessing stage in a GNN-based first-level trigger for the Electromagnetic Calorimeter inside the Belle II detector. Additionally we evaluate latency, throughput, resource utilization, and scalability for a wide range of parameters, to enable broader use for other large scale scientific experiments.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.23281v1</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] NR2F6 deletion revives CAR-T cell function and induces antigen-agnostic immune memory in solid tumors</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69796-0</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 27 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69796-0"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-69796-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T in solid tumors are limited by the antigen heterogeneity and tumor microenvironment (TME) induced exhaustion.

Abstract: Ermakov has shown how the solution to the classical harmonic oscillator in one spatial dimension with general time-dependent frequency can be reduced to the time-independent case and an associated nonlinear ordinary differential equation, an analysis which has been applied to the Schr\"odinger equation as well. We extend this analysis to the Landau problem of a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field in two dimensions and construct the generalized Laughlin wave functions for the case when the magnetic field is time-dependent. We also work out the dynamics of density fluctuations (the Girvin, MacDonald, Platzman or GMP mode) and argue that it is possible to tune the frequency of the magnetic field to obtain a compressible droplet of fermions. We also analyze the dynamics of the edge modes of the droplet for the integer Hall effect.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.21323v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] On the electrical double layer capacitance of the restricted primitive model: a link between the mesoscopic theory and the associative mean spherical approximation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21731</link><description>arXiv:2602.21731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results for the electrical double layer capacitance and the charge density of ``free ions'' obtained from the mesoscopic theory are compared with the corresponding results of the associative mean spherical approximation.

Abstract: We investigate the interplay between relativistic spin-momentum locking arising from altermagnetism and various forms of inversion symmetry breaking. Depending on the symmetry breaking, this can give rise to Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling (SOC), Weyl-type SOC, or the coexistence of two distinct spin-momentum lockings. We focus on the altermagnetic Ca2RuO4 as a testbed material. Our results reproduce the experimentally observed ground state, which is an A-centered magnetic order with the Neel vector along the b-axis, hosting spin cantings along the a- and c-axes but without weak ferromagnetism. Ca2RuO4 exhibits relativistic spin-momentum locking, with different even-parity wave orders for the three spin components. We interpret the experimental results on doped samples as evidence for a transition from a pure altermagnetic phase to a weak ferromagnetic phase. Under ferroelectric- and antiferroelectric-like distortions, there are no qualitative changes in the non-relativistic spin-momentum locking and in the weak ferromagnetism. However, we observe the rise of the Rashba or Weyl-type SOC. Using numerical and analytical models, we investigate which nodal planes persist when inversion symmetry is broken in the relativistic case. The spin-momentum locking of the other components adopt a p-wave character in the case of Rashba; in contrast, Weyl-type SOC disrupts all nodal planes, leaving only nodal lines. Finally, to simulate a stripe phase with structural distortions along the z-axis, we studied a modulated electric field inducing atomic displacements within one Ca2RuO4 layer. This produces a magnetic phase transition to an exotic altermagnetic state with two non-relativistic spin-momentum lockings hosting weak ferromagnetism.

Abstract: Ultra-stable glasses prepared from the physical vapor deposition of organic molecules present a very low density of two-level states, the kind of glass defects that determine their peculiar low temperature thermal properties. Numerical simulations suggest that quasi-localized harmonic vibrational modes emerge in the soft regions associated with two-level states. However, the connection between the low frequency vibrational modes and the local structural instabilities of glasses remains unexplained. Here we exploit a recently developed spectrograph for nuclear resonant analysis of inelastic X-ray scattering to probe the density of vibrational states of amorphous thin films of ultra-stable and conventional glasses down to an exceptionally low frequency of $\sim 70$ GHz. We show that the glass stability does not affect the harmonic vibrational modes at the lowest frequencies, despite a reduction of almost an order of magnitude in the density of two-level states. At the same time, the vibrational modes at higher frequencies, around the boson peak maximum, are extremely sensitive to the glass stability. Although we cannot exclude the possible existence of quasi-localized modes in glasses, we show that their presence is not strictly necessary to describe the measured density of low frequency vibrations. The experimental developments here presented pave the way to the solution to the long-standing debate on the low frequency vibrations in glasses.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.22071v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Thermal activation drives a finite-size crossover from scale-free to runaway avalanches in amorphous solids</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22198</link><description>arXiv:2602.22198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate thermal avalanche dynamics in amorphous solids using elastoplastic models with local activation rules and no external driving. Dynamical heterogeneities, quantified through persistence measurements and the associated four-point susceptibility $\chi_4$, reveal the emergence of correlated spatiotemporal rearrangements as temperature is varied. As temperature increases, avalanche statistics evolve from scale-free behavior with exponential cutoffs to regimes dominated by system-spanning runaway events. We identify a system-size-dependent critical temperature $T_c(L)$ that separates intermittent avalanche dynamics from thermally assisted flow, where self-sustained avalanches transiently fluidize the system. We show that $T_c(L)$ decreases algebraically with increasing system size, suggesting that in the thermodynamic limit arbitrarily small but finite temperatures may destabilize the intermittent regime. The relation between avalanche size and duration resembles that in sheared systems, whereas the statistics of minimal distances to yielding reveal a temperature-driven reorganization of marginal stability absent in strictly driven overdamped dynamics. Our results demonstrate that thermal activation alone can generate a finite-size-controlled instability scale in disordered elastic media.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.22198v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Assessing quantum coherence in quantum annealers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21355</link><description>arXiv:2602.21355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Demonstrating genuine many-body quantum coherence in large-scale quantum processors remains a central challenge for near-term quantum technologies. Recent experiments on D-Wave quantum annealers have investigated quenches of Ising chains and observed defect densities that show Kibble-Zurek scaling, consistent with coherent quantum dynamics. However, identical scaling can arise from classical or thermal processes. Here we propose the use of many-body coherent oscillations (MBCO) as a diagnostic for the identification of system-wide coherence in analog quantum simulators. Solving the time-dependent Schrodinger equation, we show that quenches of a staggered one-dimensional Ising chain across a quantum critical point produce oscillatory signatures in defect observables. We implement this model on the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer. Using fast-anneal protocols, we find that, although defect densities follow Kibble-Zurek scaling, the expected oscillatory behavior is absent. We demonstrate that static disorder associated with individual qubits is not likely responsible for the absence of MBCO. Modest modifications to annealing schedules can dramatically enhance oscillation visibility. This work gives a general roadmap for the search for quantum coherence in noisy, large-scale quantum platforms.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.21355v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum criticality in open quantum systems from the purification perspective</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21979</link><description>arXiv:2602.21979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open quantum systems host mixed-state phases that go beyond the symmetry-protected topological and spontaneous symmetry-breaking paradigms established for closed, pure-state systems. Developing a unified and physically transparent classification of such phases remains a central challenge. In this work, we introduce a purification-based framework that systematically characterizes all mixed-state phases in one-dimensional systems with $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\sigma} \times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\tau}$ symmetry. By introducing an ancillary $\kappa$ chain and employing decorated domain-wall constructions, we derive eight purified fixed-point Hamiltonians labeled by topological indices $(\mu_{\sigma\tau},\mu_{\tau\kappa},\mu_{\kappa\sigma}) \in \{\pm1\}^3$. Tracing out the ancilla recovers the full structure of mixed-state phases, including symmetric, strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking, average symmetry-protected topological phases, and their nontrivial combinations. Interpolations between the eight fixed points naturally define a three-dimensional phase diagram with a cube geometry. The edges correspond to elementary transitions associated with single topological indices, while the faces host intermediate phases arising from competing domain-wall decorations. Along the edges, we identify a class of critical behavior that connects distinct strong-to-weak symmetry-breaking patterns associated with distinct strong subgroups, highlighting a mechanism unique to mixed-state settings. Large-scale tensor-network simulations reveal a rich phase structure, including pyramid-shaped symmetry-breaking regions and a fully symmetry-broken phase at the cube center. Overall, our purification approach provides a geometrically transparent and physically complete classification of mixed-state phases, unified with a single $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\sigma} \times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\tau} \times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\kappa}$ model.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.21979v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Temperature-activated dislocation avalanches signaling brittle-to-ductile transition in BCC micropillars</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16987</link><description>arXiv:2409.16987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carry out strain-controlled in-situ compression experiments of micron-sized tungsten (W) micropillars in the temperature range 300-900 K, together with simulations of three-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) at the same scale. Two distinct regimes are observed. At low temperatures, plastic deformation appears smooth, both temporally and spatially. Stress fluctuations are consistent with a Wiener stochastic process resulting from uncorrelated dislocation activity within the pillars. However, high-temperature stress fluctuations are highly correlated and exhibit features of self-organized criticality (SOC), with deformation located within well-defined slip bands. The high-temperature stress relaxation statistics are consistent with a thermally activated nucleation process from the surface. The nature of the transition between the two regimes is a manifestation of the brittle to ductile transition in BCC metals.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2409.16987v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Disorder-induced spin-cluster magnetism in a doped kagome spin liquid candidate</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11827</link><description>arXiv:2411.11827v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for new quantum spin liquid materials relies on systems with strong frustration such as spins on an ideal kagome lattice. However, lattice imperfections can have substantial effects which are as yet not well understood. In recent work, the two-dimensional kagome system YCu$_3$(OH)$_6$[(Cl$_x$Br$_{(1-x)}$)$_{3-y}$(OH)$_y$] has emerged as a leading candidate hosting a Dirac spin liquid which appears to survive at least for x&lt;0.4, associated with alternating-bond hexagon (ABH) disorder. Here in magnetic samples with x=0.58, y=0.1 we report unusual in-plane ferromagnetic canting (FM) of the in-plane antiferromagnet (AFM), with an unusually wide regime of short-ranged order, and propose theoretical models to explain this behavior. First, we show that Kitaev type exchanges naturally arise on the kagome lattice to second order in the known Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchanges, and that these interactions can produce the unusual in-plane FM canting from antichiral AFM. Second, we propose a phenomenological model of weakly-FM-canted spin clusters to describe the short-ranged regime and analyze quantum fluctuations in an ABH toy model to show how ABH disorder can stabilize this regime. The combination of experimental observation and theory suggests that kagome-Kitaev interactions and ABH disorder are necessary for describing the magnetic fluctuations in this family of materials, with potential implications for the proposed proximate spin liquid phase.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.11827v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A molecule with half-M\"obius topology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03516</link><description>arXiv:2507.03516v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stereoisomers of C$_{13}$Cl$_2$ exhibiting helical orbitals around a ring of carbon atoms were synthesized by atom manipulation on NaCl surfaces. We resolved the enantiomeric geometries of the singlet states by atomic force microscopy and mapped their helical orbital densities by scanning tunnelling microscopy. A ${\pi}$-orbital basis of the helical, non-planar singlets that twists by 90{\deg} in one circulation is consistent with a half-M\"obius topology. In such a topology, the ${\pi}$-orbital basis changes sign with respect to two circumnavigations and is periodic with respect to four circumnavigations. A quasiparticle on a ring with this boundary condition could be interpreted as carrying a Berry phase of ${\pi}$/2. We demonstrate reversible switching of the topology, between the two singlets of oppositely threaded half-M\"obius topology, and the planar, topologically trivial, triplet state. Multireference calculations, including large-scale sample-based ab initio calculations executed on quantum hardware, reveal that the switching is associated with a helical pseudo Jahn-Teller effect.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.03516v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dual-space cluster-diagrammatic approach to nonlocal electronic correlations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06015</link><description>arXiv:2507.06015v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the dual triply irreducible local expansion (D-TRILEX) approach for correlated electronic systems by introducing a cluster reference system for the diagrammatic expansion. This framework allows us to consistently combine the exact treatment of short-range correlation effects within the cluster, with an efficient diagrammatic description of the long-range charge and spin collective fluctuations beyond the cluster. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the one-dimensional nano-ring Hubbard model, where the low dimensionality enhances non-local correlations. Our results show that the cluster extension of D-TRILEX accurately reproduces the electronic self-energy at momenta corresponding to the Fermi energy, in good agreement with the reliable Hirsch-Fye quantum Monte Carlo solution of the problem. We further compare this method with the more computationally demanding parquet dynamical vertex approximation and find that, our method yields substantially more accurate results at momenta associated with the Fermi surface. We show that the D-TRILEX diagrammatic extension drastically reduces the periodization ambiguity of cluster quantities when mapping back to the original lattice, compared to cluster dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT). Furthermore, we identify the CDMFT impurity problem as the main source of the translational-symmetry breaking and propose a computational scheme for improving the starting point for the cluster-diagrammatic expansion.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.06015v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Active-Learning Inspired $\textit{Ab Initio}$ Theory-Experiment Loop Approach for Management of Material Defects: Application to Superconducting Qubits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02544</link><description>arXiv:2510.02544v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface oxides are associated with two-level systems (TLSs) that degrade the performance of niobium-based superconducting quantum computing devices. To address this, we introduce a predictive framework for selecting metal capping layers that inhibit niobium oxide formation. Using DFT-calculated oxygen interstitial and vacancy energies as thermodynamic descriptors, we train a logistic regression model on a limited set of experimental outcomes to successfully predict the likelihood of oxide formation beneath different capping materials. This approach identifies Zr, Hf, and Ta as effective diffusion barriers. Our analysis further reveals that the oxide formation energy per oxygen atom serves as an excellent standalone descriptor for predicting barrier performance. By combining this new descriptor with lattice mismatch as a secondary criterion to promote structurally coherent interfaces, we identify Zr, Ta, and Sc as especially promising candidates. This closed-loop strategy integrates first-principles theory, machine learning, and limited experimental data to enable rational design of next-generation materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.02544v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quasi-adiabatic thermal ensemble preparation in the thermodynamic limit</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13555</link><description>arXiv:2510.13555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a quasi-adiabatic thermal process for preparing finite-temperature ensembles in the thermodynamic limit. The process gradually transforms a thermal ensemble of a noninteracting system into that of an interacting system of interest over a finite operation time, with the temperature controlled by parameters associated with the entropy of the initial state. We analyze this process in both nonintegrable and integrable spin chains with translational invariance. For the nonintegrable case, numerical simulations combined with a thermodynamic argument indicate that the thermal properties of local observables are accurately reproduced with a single parameter, although the operation time increases exponentially with precision. In contrast, for the integrable transverse-field Ising model, we analytically show that an extensive number of parameters tied to local conserved quantities is generally necessary, and the performance is affected by the presence of a quantum phase transition. These results clarify the potential and limitations of the quasi-adiabatic thermal process for an ensemble preparation and highlight the role of integrability in determining its efficiency.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.13555v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Accelerating Recommender Model ETL with a Streaming FPGA-GPU Dataflow</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12032</link><description>arXiv:2501.12032v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The real-time performance of recommender models depends on the continuous integration of massive volumes of new user interaction data into training pipelines. While GPUs have scaled model training throughput, the data preprocessing stage - commonly expressed as Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) pipelines - has emerged as the dominant bottleneck. Production systems often dedicate clusters of CPU servers to support a single GPU node, leading to high operational cost. To address this issue, we present PipeRec, a hardware-accelerated ETL engine co-designed with online recommender model training. PipeRec introduces a training-aware ETL abstraction that exposes freshness, ordering, and batching semantics while compiling software-defined operators into reconfigurable FPGA dataflows and overlaps ETL with GPU training to maximize utilization under I/O constraints. To eliminate CPU bottlenecks, PipeRec implements a format-aware packer that streams training-ready batches directly into GPU memory via P2P DMA transfers, enabling zero-copy ingest and efficient GPU consumption. Our evaluation on three datasets shows that PipeRec accelerates ETL throughput by over 10x compared to CPU-based pipelines and up to 17x over state-of-the-art GPU ETL systems.

This includes a profound reduction in the frequency of multiple DC subsets, diminished activation marker expression, and reduced Flt3L levels in cancer patients with brain tumors compared to those without. We also demonstrate reduced intra-tumoral DCs in brain compared to lung tumors. This is the first time DC subsets have been fully characterized in a range of brain tumor patients. Importantly, corticosteroid usage was closely associated with DC defects, highlighting the adverse effects of a standard symptomatic treatment on these critical immune cells.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00535-3?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Peripheral Amylin Modulation Rebalances Brain Glycolysis and Tau-Ser214 Phosphorylation via cAMP-PKA Signaling</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00532-8?rss=yes</link><description>Brain glucose dysregulation is shared by Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and diabetes, but whether it arises from central or peripheral mechanisms remains unclear. Amylin, a pancreatic hormone, normally supports CNS cAMP-PKA signaling, metabolism and memory; however, prediabetes-associated hypersecretion disrupts this balance. Using human amylin-inducible mice, we show that toggling amylin secretion during metabolic stress bidirectionally regulates brain glycolysis and function. Excess amylin overactivates cAMP-PKA signaling, suppressing glycolysis and inducing Tau-Ser214 phosphorylation, two core features of AD pathology.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00532-8?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Multiscale spatiotemporal evolution and patterns of riverine ecological security in Nanjing Yangtze River Basin</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00524-9?rss=yes</link><description>Riverine zones possess significant land-use potential; however, rapid socioeconomic development has caused severe ecological security challenges.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate spin dependent transport in altermagnet/triplet superconductor/altermagnet (AM/TSC/AM) junctions in the presence of interfacial Rashba spin orbit coupling (RSOC). Within a microscopic Bogoliubov de Gennes scattering formalism, we compute angle and energy resolved conductance, spin polarization, zero bias response, and tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) for nodal $p_x$ and chiral $p_x+ip_y$ superconductors. Although altermagnets carry no net magnetization, the momentum dependent spin splitting, combined with RSOC, enables a pronounced spin valve effect without ferromagnetic electrodes. We show that conductance, spin polarization, and TMR exhibit distinct and robust fingerprints of the triplet pairing symmetry. For nodal $p_x$ superconductor, sign change induced surface Andreev bound states dominate subgap transport, producing strongly anisotropic conductance, giant zero bias spin polarization, and a monotonic enhancement of TMR with increasing RSOC. In contrast, the chiral $p_x+ip_y$ state exhibits smoother conductance and polarization profiles governed by topological edge modes, resulting in broader, lobe like TMR patterns with weaker sensitivity to interface transparency. Moreover, RSOC can acts as an electrically tunable spin-mixing knob, while the barrier strength controls coherence and energy selectivity, together enabling large, symmetry controlled spin filtering and magnetoresistance. Our results establish AM/TSC/AM junctions as a symmetry sensitive transport platform for realizing electrically tunable spin valve functionality and probing triplet pairing without ferromagnetic components.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.20838v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Probing frustrated spin systems with impurities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21086</link><description>arXiv:2602.21086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effective interaction between two localized spin impurities embedded in a frustrated spin-1/2 $J_1\!-\!J_2$ Heisenberg chain. Treating the impurity spins as classical moments coupled locally to the host, we combine second--order perturbation theory with large--scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations to determine the impurity--impurity interaction as a function of separation, coupling strength, and magnetic frustration. In the weak--coupling regime, we show that the interaction is governed by the the static spin susceptibility of the host and exhibits oscillatory power--law decay in the gapless phase, modified by universal logarithmic corrections at the SU(2)--symmetric critical point. In the gapped dimerized phase, the interaction decays exponentially with distance. For intermediate and strong impurity--host coupling, we observe a crossover to a boundary--dominated regime characterized by pronounced parity effects associated with the length of the chain segment between impurities, signaling a breakdown of the simple RKKY--like description. Our results establish impurity--impurity interactions as a sensitive probe of frustrated quantum spin liquids and provide a controlled framework for distinguishing gapless and gapped phases through local perturbations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.21086v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Rapid Primary Radiation Damage Resistance Assessment of Precipitation-Hardened Cu Alloys</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21093</link><description>arXiv:2602.21093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study establishes a direct correlation between in situ irradiation-induced property changes measured by transient grating spectroscopy (TGS) and the resulting microstructural damage in Cu-Cr-Ta alloys. Thin films fabricated by physical vapor deposition were irradiated with 6.6 MeV Cu +3 ions up to 25 DPA, while TGS continuously monitored the evolution of surface acoustic wave (SAW) frequency and thermal diffusivity. Post-irradiation transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to quantify void formation as a metric of accumulated radiation damage. A pronounced decrease in SAW frequency was observed some seconds after the onset of irradiation, and it was found to correlate strongly with the final void density. Vacancy MEB calculations propose that the small decrease in SAW frequency is associated with the low population of mobile vacancies, promoting defect recombination and decreasing void formation. This relationship enables early prediction of relative radiation damage resistance within minutes of irradiation, substantially reducing the time required compared to conventional irradiation and postcharacterization routes, allowing rapid screening of multiple compositions. We were able to test this method with 3 compositions of the Cu-Cr-Ta system. More generally, this in situ approach provides an efficient pathway for accelerating the development of materials for radiation environments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.21093v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Graded anisotropic metamaterials for elastic wave mode conversion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20172</link><description>arXiv:2602.20172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient transmission of elastic waves across interfaces is central to several applications, including medical imaging, seismic isolation, and transducer design. Interfaces with abrupt changes in the material properties significantly impede wave transmission, leading to reflections. This limitation, known as impedance mismatch, becomes even more prominent for mode conversion between different wave types due to polarization mismatch. In this study, we investigate a mechanism employing two-dimensional functionally graded anisotropic metamaterials to facilitate longitudinal--shear mode conversion as waves propagate from a stiff to a compliant medium. By embedding density and anisotropic shape gradients within the functionally graded metamaterial, polarization-induced impedance mismatch is mitigated and efficient mode conversion is enabled. We use unit cell dispersion analysis to tailor the frequency range for mode conversion through gradation in the dispersion behavior and coupling between modes. Using frequency-domain finite element analysis, we demonstrate broadband mode conversion across interfaces with large stiffness contrast operating in the 1--10 kHz range. We then experimentally validate and quantify mode conversion through full-field velocity measurements on an additively manufactured specimen. We further apply the methodology to design a device capable of converting radial--tangential wave modes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.20172v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Generative Deep Learning for the Two-Dimensional Quantum Rotor Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20772</link><description>arXiv:2602.20772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of diverse generative deep learning models and their variants has furnished substantial insights for investigating quantum many-body problems. In this work, we design two models based on the foundational architecture of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to investigate the ground-state properties and phase transition characteristics of the two-dimensional quantum rotor model (QRM). Within a semi-supervised learning framework, we incorporate multiple layers of transposed convolutions in the generator, enabling the conditional GAN to more efficiently extract low-dimensional encoded information. Analysis of one-dimensional latent variables associated with ground-state samples for different system sizes allows us to pinpoint the location of the critical point. In addition, we introduce dynamically adaptive weighting factors related to the distributional characteristics into the loss function of the deep convolutional GAN, and utilize upsampling techniques to enlarge the generated sample sizes. Comparisons of the optimization processes for mean magnetization and potential energy density across different magnetization regimes of QRM demonstrate that our model can efficiently generate valid ground-state samples, significantly reducing computational time. Our results highlight the promising potential of generative deep learning in quantum phase transition research, especially in critical point identification and the auxiliary generation of simulation data for quantum many-body models.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.20772v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Residual Entropy of Glasses and the Third Law Expression</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11421</link><description>arXiv:2207.11421v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The third law of thermodynamics dictates that the entropy of materials becomes zero as temperature ($T$) approaches zero. Contrarily, glass and other similar materials exhibit nonzero entropy at $T=0$, which contradicts the third law. For over a century, it has been a common practice to evade this problem by regarding glass as nonequilibrium. However, this treatment causes many inconsistencies in thermodynamics theory. This paper provides resolutions to these inconsistencies and provides a rigorous expression of the third law without any exception. To seek the entropy origin, the anthropomorphic feature of entropy must be resolved. Because entropy can be uniquely determined only when thermodynamic coordinates (TCs) are specified, we have to know which are TCs. This requires the reconsideration of the definition of equilibrium for solids in an unambiguous way, which does not depend on the solid structure. On this basis, it is deduced that TCs of solids are the equilibrium positions of atoms. TCs comprise a thermodynamic space, on which a unique value can be assigned to the entropy. For solids, equilibrium states are specified by discrete points in the thermodynamic space, which define atom configurations. Among various atom configurations, only one is thermally activated at sufficiently low temperatures, and others are called frozen configuration, which do not contribute to the temperature dependence of entropy in that region. The rigorous statement of the third law has been established by expressing that the entropy associated with the active configuration vanishes at $T=0$. Residual entropy arises when the entropy is evaluated on an extended space including the frozen configurations, which were previously active at high temperatures. The reconciliation of the two different views is explained through several debates on the glass transition.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2207.11421v5</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interplay of Zeeman field, Rashba spin-orbit interaction, and superconductivity: spin susceptibility</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15056</link><description>arXiv:2506.15056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a self-consistent theory to calculate the static and uniform spin susceptibility in superconductors under simultaneous Zeeman magnetic fields and Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Employing a single-band Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian, we solve the gap equation for both conventional $s$-wave spin-singlet and six representative $p$-wave spin-triplet pairing states, categorized into opposite-spin-pairing (OSP) and equal-spin-pairing (ESP) classes. The Kubo formula, decomposed into intra- and interband particle-hole and particle-particle channels, provides two key constraints: at zero temperature, only particle-particle terms contribute, while at the critical temperature $T_c$, only particle-hole terms remain, ensuring $\chi(T_c^{-}) = \chi_N$ for continuous phase transitions. For $s$-wave pairing, a Zeeman field reduces $T_c$, whereas Rashba SOC preserves $T_c$ but yields a residual zero temperature spin susceptibility $\chi(0)$ which approaches $2\chi_N/3$ in the strong SOC limit; combined fields create a Bogoliubov Fermi surface, resulting in a kink in $\chi(0)$. In contrast, $p$-wave states exhibit strong anisotropy: OSP states mimic spin-singlet pairing behavior for parallel Zeeman fields and ESP for transverse ones, while ESP states show the opposite, with Rashba SOC potentially changing the quasiparticle nodal structure, lowering $T_c$, or causing $\chi_{zz}(0)$ divergences. This framework offers quantitative benchmarks for Knight-shift experiments in non-centrosymmetric superconductors like A$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$ (A = Na, K, Rb, and Cs), enabling diagnostics to disentangle pairing symmetry, SOC strength, and Zeeman effects.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.15056v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Disconnection formation via segregation-induced grain boundary phase transitions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19429</link><description>arXiv:2507.19429v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disconnections, long recognized as the key mediators of grain boundary (GB) kinetics in polycrystalline materials, have traditionally been understood to nucleate through thermal or mechanical activation. In this work, using atomistic simulations, we reveal a distinct nucleation mechanism driven exclusively by solute interstitial segregation across multiple substitutional binary alloy systems (e.g., Al-Ni, Al-Fe). This process exhibits zero-nucleation energy barriers, contrasting sharply with the nucleation mechanisms in pure systems. We identify states that are activated through segregation-induced GB phase transitions: (i) isolated disconnections or phase junctions that promote GB migration and disappear with continuous segregation, and (ii) composite disconnections that are formed via two oppositely oriented isolated disconnections. The disconnections are mechanically robust, suppressing shear-coupled migration and instead resulting in GB amorphization and pure sliding under applied shear loading. The long-range stress fields associated with these composite disconnections further attract solute atoms and assist the nucleation of precipitates. These disconnections, absent in pure materials, follow unique nucleation pathways as confirmed through dichromatic pattern analysis and persist across different alloy chemistries and crystal structures. Our findings demonstrate that solute interstitial segregation provides a powerful and previously unrecognized pathway for barrier-free disconnection formation, thereby fundamentally extending current understanding of GB kinetics in alloy systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.19429v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Altermagnetic Spin Precession and Spin Transistor</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05208</link><description>arXiv:2511.05208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets hold great potential for spintronic applications, yet their intrinsic spin dynamics and associated transport properties remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate spin-resolved quantum transport in a multi-terminal setup based on a $d$-wave altermagnet. It is found that the altermagnetic spin splitting in momentum space induces an interesting spin precession in two-dimensional real space, giving rise to characteristic spin patterns. This altermagnetic spin precession manifests as a spatial modulation of the transverse Hall-like voltage, whose oscillation period provides a direct measure of the spin-splitting strength. When the altermagnetism is electrically tunable, the proposed setup functions as a prototype for a highly efficient spin transistor. The key physical effects are shown to be robust against dephasing and crystalline warping. Our work not only identifies a fingerprint signature of altermagnets, offering a direct probe of the altermagnetic spin splitting, but also represents an important step toward bridging their fundamental physics with practical spintronic applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.05208v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Jordan-Wigner Transformation for the Description of Strong Correlation in Fermionic Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19938</link><description>arXiv:2512.19938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Seniority is a useful way of organizing Hilbert space for strongly correlated systems. The exact zero-seniority wave function, doubly-occupied configuration interaction (DOCI), provides accurate results (given the right orbitals) for many strongly correlated electronic systems but has a combinatorial computational cost. In many cases, pair coupled cluster doubles provides a polynomial-cost approximation that closely reproduces the energies of DOCI, but it breaks down in some cases and, as shown herein, it does not provide particularly good density matrices. In this work, we demonstrate that by using the Jordan-Wigner transformation to turn the seniority zero problem back into a fermionic one, we can provide mean-field variational results of DOCI quality for the Hubbard model and a few small molecular dissociation examples, with polynomial cost, both for the energies and for density matrices, all while being protected from collapse. This success is rooted in the proof we provide showing that the Hartree-Fock wave function on the Jordan-Wigner--transformed Hamiltonian transforms back to variational coupled cluster doubles in the seniority zero representation, but restricted to have determinant rather than permanent amplitude coefficients, without compromising its overall accuracy.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.19938v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Thermodynamics of Shastry-Sutherland Model under Magnetic Field</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11589</link><description>arXiv:2602.11589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent experimental discovery of the $T$-linear specific heat in pressurized and magnetized Shastry-Sutherland Mott insulator SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$, we perform the state-of-the-art thermal tensor-network computation on the Shastry-Sutherland model under a magnetic field. Our simulation results suggest the existence of a symmetric intermediate phase with $T$-linear specific heat at low temperature, occupying a large parameter space and between the plaquette-singlet phase and antiferromagnetic phase at low fields and other symmetry-breaking phases at high fields before the system is fully polarized. Such an unexpected novel state bears an astonishing similarity to the experimental findings in the material. It opens the door to further investigations of the possible liberation of deconfined magnetized Dirac spinons by the competing interactions in this highly frustrated quantum magnet model, and by the combined effects of magnetic field and pressure in the associated Shastry-Sutherland Mott insulator SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11589v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Transition between one- and two-dimensional topology in a Chern insulator of finite width</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16411</link><description>arXiv:2602.16411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topology in quantum systems is typically considered in infinite crystals in one, two, or higher integer dimensions. Here, we show that one can continuously transform a system between a topological phase associated with one dimension and a topological phase associated with two dimensions without closing the energy gap. In this process, the dimension of the system itself changes. Concretely, we investigate a modified version of the Qi-Wu-Zhang model and develop a procedure to smoothly shrink the width of the system in one direction. By tracking gaps which remain open throughout the modulation, we establish a smooth transition from a two-dimensional to a one-dimensional topological insulator. In between the system exhibits both one- and two-dimensional topology, and the way the system accomplishes the transition is by making the one-dimensional topology more robust as the width decreases, while the two-dimensional topology becomes less robust. Finally, we show how the gaps arise from hybridization of edge states due to the finite width.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.16411v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] FAST-Prefill: FPGA Accelerated Sparse Attention for Long Context LLM Prefill</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20515</link><description>arXiv:2602.20515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In long-context large language model (LLM) inference, the prefill stage dominates computation due to self-attention over the complete input context. Sparse attention significantly reduces self-attention computation by limiting each token's interactions to a subset of tokens. The attention sparsity pattern varies across input prompts, and within a prompt, each attention head can follow a distinct pattern. This makes attention sparsity dynamic. The requirement of generating the sparsity pattern, combined with limited data reuse in attention, shifts the prefill compute to being memory-bound. This, in addition to the huge energy requirements for long-context inference on GPU, motivates FPGAs as good candidates for accelerating dynamic long-context inference.
  To tackle these challenges, we propose FAST-Prefill, the first FPGA accelerator for long-context prefill-stage inference with dynamic sparse attention. To efficiently generate sparse indices, we propose a \textit{fused pipeline unit with a memory-aware execution order} to reduce large tensors and irregular memory accesses. To reduce off-chip memory traffic for accessing the KV cache, we utilize the memory hierarchy to design a \textit{liveness-driven, dual-tier cache}. For high-throughput matrix multiplication, we design a \textit{hybrid Matrix Processing Unit (MPU)} with DSPs and bit-plane decomposition using LUTs. We implement FAST-Prefill on Alveo U280 and evaluate it on the Llama and Qwen models (batch size = 1) for context lengths ranging from 4K to 128K tokens. We demonstrate an average speedup of up to 2.5$\times$ in TTFT and 4.5$\times$ improvement in energy efficiency over GPU implementation on Nvidia A5000 GPU.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.20515v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] LUTstructions: Self-loading FPGA-based Reconfigurable Instructions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20802</link><description>arXiv:2602.20802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General-purpose processors feature a limited number of instructions based on an instruction set. They can be numerous, such as with vector extensions that include hundreds or thousands of instructions, but this comes at a cost; they are often unable to express arbitrary tasks efficiently. This paper explores the concept of having reconfigurable instructions by incorporating reconfigurable areas in a softcore. It follows a relatively-recently proposed computer architecture concept for seamlessly loading instruction implementation-carrying bitstreams from main memory. The resulting softcore is entirely evaluated on an FPGA, essentially having an FPGA-on-an-FPGA for the instruction implementations, with no notable operating frequency overhead. This is achieved with a custom FPGA architecture called LUTstruction, which is tailored towards low-latency for custom instructions and wide reconfiguration, as well as a soft implementation for the purposes of architectural exploration.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.20802v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Interconnect-Aware Logic Resynthesis for Multi-Die FPGAs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19720</link><description>arXiv:2602.19720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-die FPGAs enable device scaling beyond reticle limits but introduce severe interconnect overhead across die boundaries. Inter-die connections, commonly referred to as super-long lines (SLLs), incur high delay and consume scarce interposer interconnect resources, often dominating critical paths and complicating physical design. To address this, this work proposes an interconnect-aware logic resynthesis method that restructures the LUT-level netlist to reduce the number of SLLs. The resynthesis engine uses die partitioning information to apply logic resubstitutions, which simplifies local circuit structures and eliminates SLLs. By reducing the number of SLLs early in the design flow, prior to physical implementation, the proposed method shortens critical paths, alleviates pressure on scarce interposer interconnect resources, and improves overall physical design flexibility. We further build a tool flow for multi-die FPGAs by integrating the proposed resynthesis method with packing and placement. Experimental results on the EPFL benchmarks show that, compared with a state-of-the-art framework, the proposed method reduces the number of SLLs by up to 24.8% for a 2-die FPGA and up to 27.38% for a 3-die FPGA. On MCNC benchmarks, our tool flow achieves an average SLL reduction of 1.65% while preserving placement quality. On Koios benchmarks, where fewer removable SLLs exist, several designs still exhibit considerable inter-die edge reductions. Overall, the results confirm that reducing inter-die connections at the logic level is an effective approach for multi-die FPGAs.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.19720v2</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

To systematically evaluate their fidelity, we performed cross-species single-cell RNA sequencing, integrating data from human aortic dissection with five mouse models (BAPN, Ang-II, Ang-II apoE-/-, elastase, and CaCl2). Comparative analysis across four key cell types revealed model-specific transcriptional parallels to human disease. The BAPN model recapitulated human pro-inflammatory and lipid-associated macrophage states, as well as pro-inflammatory fibroblast signatures.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00522-5?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] LMO1 expression in neuroblastoma cells reprograms tumor-associated macrophages to promote metastasis</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00519-5?rss=yes</link><description>Neuroblastoma (NB) accounts for 10% of pediatric cancer-related deaths, is often highly metastatic at diagnosis, and has a 5-year-survival rate of &lt;50% for patients with high-risk disease. We previously showed that the transcriptional coactivator LMO1 cooperates with the MYCN oncogene to enhance NB tumorigenesis and metastasis. To better understand this synergy, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing analysis on primary tumors from transgenic zebrafish overexpressing MYCN alone or with LMO1. Interestingly, we found that the macrophage populations from the two tumor types were transcriptionally distinct and LMO1 increased cancer-cell secretion of cytokines associated with metastasis and angiogenesis.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00519-5?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] A unique malignant cell type per patient tumor encoded in each cancer cell transcriptome</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00514-6?rss=yes</link><description>Deciphering shared features between patients through unsupervised analyses of tumor single-cell transcriptomes is hindered by the predominant clustering of malignant cells based on the patients' tumor of origin. In contrast, cancer-associated non-malignant cells cluster according to their cell type (e.g. macrophage), independently from the patient. We investigated the origin of this contrasting clustering behavior using computational analyses and data sampling techniques across 14 cancer types. We demonstrate that tumor-driven malignant cell clustering is independent from technical or computational biases, and non-reducible to tumor-specific gene sets.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00514-6?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[Nature] Scientists face fallout for past associations with Epstein</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00554-4</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature, Published online: 25 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00554-4"&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-026-00554-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Jack Horner, who was a consultant for the Jurassic Park films, is among the researchers whose work or careers have been affected because of revelations from newly released documents.</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00554-4</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Exceptional fine structure in the photoluminescence excitation spectra of perovskites: Evidence for Rashba splitting?</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/8/082104/3381318/Exceptional-fine-structure-in-the</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;In this communication, distinctive photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectral properties in films of methylammonium lead tribromide grown on yttrium-stabilized zirconium oxide in the presence of an ionic liquid are reported.

Abstract: For the first time, the field dependences of the magnetoresistance of a textured polycrystalline Bi$_{88.08}$Mn$_{11.92}$ sample were investigated in the $H \perp I$ and $H \parallel I$ configurations, and the results were compared with those previously obtained for the solid solution Bi$_{95.69}$Mn$_{3.69}$Fe$_{0.62}$ with a lower manganese concentration. It was demonstrated that the magnetoresistance field dependencies for Bi$_{88.08}$Mn$_{11.92}$ differ significantly from those of Bi$_{95.69}$Mn$_{3.69}$Fe$_{0.62}$ below 100 K, becoming nearly identical as the temperature approaches room temperature. It was established that the maximum relative magnetoresistance values for Bi$_{88.08}$Mn$_{11.92}$ are observed at a magnetic field of 90 kOe and a temperature of 100 K in both the $H \perp I$ and $H \parallel I$ configurations, amounting to 3170\% and 380\%, respectively. These values are significantly lower than those previously reported for the solid solution containing less manganese (Bi$_{95.69}$Mn$_{3.69}$Fe$_{0.62}$), which were 3877\% and 742\%, respectively. Analysis of the results indicates that differences in field dependence among the studied materials are associated with varying amounts of magnetic $\alpha$-BiMn. The anomalous magnetoresistance behavior, as compared with that of pure bismuth, is attributed to the influence of internal magnetism on electrical transport within the bismuth matrix of the studied solid solutions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.19181v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] On the anomalous elasticity in the mechanical response of amorphous solids</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19299</link><description>arXiv:2602.19299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The response of amorphous solids to a mechanical perturbation consists in an elastic and a plastic deformation. The latter is mediated by localized irreversible rearrangements associated with Eshelby-like quadrupolar singularities in the displacement field. It has recently been argued that a density of such singularities leads to an anomalous elastic behavior taking the form of screening effects, which goes beyond classical elastic predictions. Here, we reexamine this scenario using general theoretical arguments and a description in terms of an elasto-plastic model, which we compare with atomistic simulations of the canonical Eshelby inclusion geometry. We discuss the conditions under which a finite, i.e., nonvanishing, density of quadrupolar events is created by an imposed perturbation. We argue that, except when the perturbation is macroscopic, there are many situations in which the density of quadrupolar defects is zero in the thermodynamic limit. In these cases, we find that plastically active quadrupoles emerge in a region whose size generically scales as the spatial extent $\ell$ of the mechanical perturbation. This mechanism leads to anomalous elasticity on a scale $\ell$ close to the perturbation and to conventional elasticity beyond. The simulations of the elasto-plastic model reproduce the emergence of plastic quadrupoles in a region set by $\ell$ and the associated renormalization of the effective shear modulus, but they do not exhibit the dipole-screening signatures reported in atomistic and experimental studies. Our analysis delineates the scale-dependent breakdown of long-wavelength elasticity in amorphous materials and suggests directions for incorporating anomalous screening into mesoscopic modeling frameworks.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.19299v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dual energy-differentiated topological transition in artificial red phosphorus chains</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19347</link><description>arXiv:2602.19347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral and transport properties of an atomic chain of red phosphorus. We reveal the separation of flat-band states from the rest of the system and calculate its energy bands analytically. The topological properties of the system are established through the evaluation of the Berry (Zak) phase of the energy bands, revealing nontrivial topology. The Berry phase depends on the relative strength of the hopping parameters and exhibits dual energy-dependent topological phase transitions. Remarkably, the emergence of inert band edges provides a direct spectral signature of these transitions, acting as energy-resolved indicators of the redistribution of topological charge between bands. The existence of the associated edge states is proved numerically for finite lattices. The theoretical predictions, particularly the band structure and the existence of edge states, are further confirmed by numerical simulations of red phosphorus through a phononic lattice in the form of a highly structured aluminum plate.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.19347v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling Induced Topological Phases Transition in Honeycomb Nanoribbon Heterojunction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19568</link><description>arXiv:2602.19568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the emergence of non-trivial topological phases arising from the interplay between structural geometry and the spin degree of freedom. Our system is a honeycomb nanoribbon heterostructure with armchair edges, consisting of a central Rashba spin-orbit coupled (SOC) region sandwiched between two pristine armchair nanoribbons. As the strength of Rashba SOC is increased, topological edge states exhibit at the interface between the Rashba SOC and pristine armchair honeycomb nanoribbon (ANR), and these edge states remain robust under edge perturbations. In addition, we find that for a finite width ANR, Rashba SOC can open/close a gap depending on its strength, which leads to a topological phase transition. This work provides an alternative perspective on how Rashba SOC influences topological properties.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.19568v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Optical properties of single CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots synthesized by a modified ligand-assisted reprecipitation method</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19693</link><description>arXiv:2602.19693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colloidal perovskite quantum dots (pQDs) are promising quantum light emitters, and investigations at the single pQD scale have so far relied mostly on hot-injection synthesis, which requires precise temperature control and an inert atmosphere. While alternative synthesis routes under milder conditions are often associated with structural and surface defects that may have limited impact in ensemble measurements, demonstrating high optical quality at the level of individual pQDs constitutes the most stringent benchmark for a new synthesis protocol. Here, we demonstrate that a modified ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP) approach yields CsPbBr3 pQDs showing state-of-the-art optical properties at the scale of single emitters. By combining an amine-mediated post-synthetic size-trimming strategy with didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB) ligands for enhanced surface passivation and colloidal stability, we obtain isolated pQDs with stable emission and minimal spectral diffusion at cryogenic temperatures. Micro-photoluminescence experiments resolve the characteristic fine structure of the bright exciton, its low-energy optical phonon replicas, and the trion and biexciton states. Time-resolved and photon correlation measurements show a ~90 ps lifetime and high purity single photon emission, respectively. These results demonstrate that modified LARP synthesis constitutes an accessible alternative to hot injection, preserving the intrinsic excitonic and quantum optical properties of individual pQDs while offering greater flexibility for post-synthetic ligand engineering, as exemplified here by the use of DDAB for surface passivation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.19693v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Strain- and Field-Tunable Nonrelativistic Spin Splitting and Wave-Symmetry-Dependent Spin Transport in Twisted Bilayer Altermagnets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19713</link><description>arXiv:2602.19713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetism-driven nonrelativistic spin splitting (NRSS) provides a pathway toward efficient, spin-orbit-free spintronics. In centrosymmetric two-dimensional antiferromagnets, spin-polarized transport is symmetry-forbidden due to the combined space-time inversion ($PT$) symmetry. Here, by employing first-principles density functional theory and spin-group symmetry analysis, we demonstrate that twisting two antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic monolayers of CoCl$_2$, AX$_2$ (A = Mn, V; X = Cl, Br, I), NiF$_2$, NiBr$_2$, FeS, CoS, MnTe$_2$, MnSe$_2$, and RuSe induces finite NRSS even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. The relative twist breaks $[C_2||P]$ and $[E||C_{nz}]$ symmetries, giving rise to momentum-dependent spin polarization with distinct $d$-, $g$-, and $i$-wave altermagnetic patterns across the Brillouin zone. Using symmetry-invariant $k\cdot p$ modeling, we extract linear spin-splitting coefficients $\alpha^{(1)}$ ranging from 800-1100 meV\AA{}, comparable to SOC-induced Rashba-Dresselhaus strengths observed in noncentrosymmetric semiconductors. An out-of-plane electric field ($\mathcal{E}_z$) introduces Zeeman-type band splitting up to 110 meV at 10 MV/cm, while biaxial strain tunes the NRSS magnitude nearly linearly without altering symmetry. Crucially, the strain $u_{xx-yy}$ reduces the spin point group symmetry and drives reversible $g/i \rightarrow d$ wave-type transitions, resulting in finite spin conductivity and an enhanced spin-splitter angle (up to 18$^\circ$). These results extend the concept of altermagnetism to twisted bilayer geometries and establish a general route for realizing exchange-driven, nonrelativistic spin currents through symmetry engineering without requiring heavy elements or spin-orbit coupling.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.19713v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Twist-induced altermagnetism in a metallic van der Waals antiferromagnet</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19734</link><description>arXiv:2602.19734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism -a magnetic state characterized by spin-polarized electronic bands at zero net magnetization- offers a promising route for next-generation spintronic devices. In two-dimensional (2D) magnets, twist engineering enables its realization by breaking the combined inversion and time-reversal symmetry (PT) while preserving crystal symmetries that ensure the altermagnetic order. Here, by means of first-principles calculations and symmetry analysis, we demonstrate that twist engineering applied to the recently synthesized metallic van der Waals antiferromagnet Co-doped bilayer Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ (Fe$_2$CoGaTe$_2$) provides a robust platform for altermagnetism. By twisting two layers of Fe$_2$CoGaTe$_2$, the PT symmetry between opposite spin sublattices is broken, resulting in a non-relativistic $i$-wave altermagnetic state with spin splitting up to 138 meV. In the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the electronic states are spin-degenerate along six high-symmetry directions, while the inclusion of SOC preserves this degeneracy along the three directions protected by twofold rotation axes. Furthermore, we unveil the microscopic mechanisms governing the magnetic behavior in twisted Fe$_2$CoGaTe$_2$. Our results establish twist engineering and metallic Fe-based van der Waals antiferromagnets as versatile platforms to realize 2D van der Waals altermagnetism, with potential for designing high-efficiency ultrathin nanodevices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.19734v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A label-free method to quantify early-stage amyloid aggregation under flow via intrinsic phenylalanine fluorescence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19817</link><description>arXiv:2602.19817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aggregation of amyloid-forming peptides is a dynamic, complex process that underlies their diverse biological activities, from physiological functions to disease-associated dysfunctions. While the structure of fibrillar end-products is well-characterized for most amyloids, the heterogeneous and often transient oligomers, likely key in cytotoxicity, remain poorly investigated, especially for peptides with low-yield aromatic residues. Here, by exploiting and developing flow induced dispersion analysis in both peak and front modes, we demonstrate that intrinsic phenylalanine fluorescence can be harnessed to quantify the conversion of diffusing monomers into non-diffusing oligomers and fibrils. We further characterize low-molecular-weight oligomers, and their size evolution from 2 to 10 nm over time. Importantly, we validate the robustness of our approach using two tryptophan-free and fast-fibrillating amyloid peptides, PSM$\alpha$3 and hIAPP, known for their key roles in S. aureus virulence and type 2 diabetes respectively. Our results overcome the limitations of traditional biochemical and biophysical amyloid assays by extending analysis from large oligomers and fibrils to small heterogeneous oligomers, under near-physiological conditions. This study thus offers a new analytical framework, thereby filling a critical gap in amyloid research, to probe the early stages of aggregation, key in the design of alternative therapeutics for amyloid-diseases.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.19817v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Convex Analysis of Relaxation Dynamics in Chemical Reaction Networks and Generalized Gradient Flows</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18932</link><description>arXiv:2602.18932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain bounds on the Kullback--Leibler divergence to equilibrium for mass-action chemical reaction networks (CRNs) with equilibrium. The associated decay rates are characterized in terms of the singular values of the stoichiometric matrix, convexity parameters, and time-integrated activities via deformed-exponential-type functions. We further extend these bounds within a generalized gradient flow framework. We highlight the biological relevance of this framework: the resulting bounds apply to quasi-steady-state regimes, where long transients and plateau-like behavior are common and functionally important. We illustrate the framework using a catalytic CRN exhibiting plateaus, where the bounds capture slow relaxation induced by local convexity and provide a bound-based approach to quantifying relaxation in CRNs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.18932v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Artificial Neural Network (ANN) -- Oscillatory Neural Network (ONN) Hybrid System Using Domain-Wall Synapse Devices and Nano-Constriction Spin Hall Nano Oscillators</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19226</link><description>arXiv:2602.19226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A coupled spintronic oscillator array has been considered attractive for neuromorphic computing applications. Experimental reports have shown the nano-constriction geometry to be a relatively easier-to-fabricate platform for implementing such spin oscillators, but most prior reports on training and inference algorithms for neuromorphic computing using spin oscillators have been mostly restricted to the nano-pillar geometry. Also, those prior reports involve updating the natural frequency values of the oscillators and moving the synchronization regions on to the data clusters during the offline learning phase, which has associated challenges. In this context, we design and simulate a novel artificial neural network (ANN) - oscillator neural network (ONN) algorithm where in the offline learning phase, the weight parameters of the ANN are updated such that the data clusters are instead moved to the synchronization regions of spin Hall nano oscillators (SHNOs) in the nano-constriction geometry, as obtained through micromagnetic simulations. We further simulate the on-chip inference part of the ANN-ONN algorithm where the ANN is implemented on a crossbar array of domain-wall synapse devices, as simulated here through micromagnetics, and the ONN is implemented on nano-constriction SHNOs. We show successful data classification for both binary and multi-class classification tasks to demonstrate the generalizability of our proposed scheme.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.19226v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Emergence of opinion splits in the Sznajd model with latency</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19453</link><description>arXiv:2602.19453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the modelling of social systems, opinion latency is the idea that once an agent changes its opinion, there will be a period of time where it is immune to other changes. When added to the voter model this leads to a situation where no matter how low the latency is or how many opinions are considered, all opinions end up in a coexistence where they are equally represented. In this work, we examine what happens when latency is added to the Sznajd model. What we find is that for low latency, the model behaves roughly like it does in the absence of latency, where one opinion will always eventually dominate. For high latency, the possibility for a symmetric coexistence of 2 opinions arises, but contrary to the voter model, a coexistence of more than 2 opinions is never stable. We provide evidence of this phenomenon with computer simulations of the model in Barab\'asi-Albert networks, together with a mean field treatment that is able to capture the observed behavior. We argue that this could hint at an explanation for the prevalence of two opinion splits in the real world.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.19453v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Krylov Distribution and Universal Convergence of Quantum Fisher Information</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19750</link><description>arXiv:2602.19750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a spectral-resolvent framework for computing the quantum Fisher information (QFI) using Krylov subspace methods, extending the notion of the Krylov distribution. By expressing the QFI as a resolvent moment of the superoperator $\mathcal{K}_\rho$ associated with a density matrix, the Krylov distribution quantifies how the QFI weight is distributed across Krylov levels in operator space and provides a natural measure for controlling the truncation error in Krylov approximations. Leveraging orthogonal polynomial theory, we identify two universal convergence regimes: exponential decay when the Liouville-space spectrum is gapped away from zero, and algebraic decay governed by hard-edge (Bessel) universality when small eigenvalues accumulate near zero. This framework establishes a direct connection between quantum metrology, spectral geometry, and Krylov dynamics, offering both conceptual insight and practical tools for efficient QFI computation in high-dimensional and many-body systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.19750v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A Physics-Regularized Neural Network and Kirchhoff Markov Random Field Framework for Inferring Internal Electrochemical States from Operando Spectromicroscopy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19888</link><description>arXiv:2602.19888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative understanding of coupled reaction and transport processes in lithium-ion battery (LIB) composite electrodes remains challenging because key internal states cannot be measured directly. In this study, we develop a physics-integrated, data-driven analysis pipeline to estimate internal electrochemical states from operando microscopic X-ray absorption fine structure ($\mu$-XAFS) hyperspectral data of LIB cathodes with LiPF$_6$ electrolyte. State-of-charge (SOC) maps are first constructed from Co K-edge spectra. To resolve ambiguities in the two-phase reaction region, a physics-regularized three-layer neural network is introduced, enforcing spatial continuity of SOC and current conservation. The inferred SOC dynamics are then incorporated into a Kirchhoff-based Markov random field framework that integrates Kirchhoff's current and voltage laws, Ohm's law, and a symmetric Butler-Volmer relation to estimate interfacial current, ionic current, electrolyte potential, and effective ionic conductivity. Application to composite electrodes with different initial electrolyte concentrations (0.3, 1, and 2M LiPF$_6$) reveals distinct reaction propagation behaviors governed by electrolyte concentration-dependent conductivity. The inferred electrolyte concentration distributions show qualitative agreement with independent operando X-ray transmission imaging performed on LIB composite cathodes employing a LiAsF$_6$ electrolyte. This framework enables quantitative visualization of otherwise inaccessible internal transport phenomena.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.19888v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Global anomalies of Green's function zeros</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08093</link><description>arXiv:2405.08093v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study global anomalies of nonlocal effective theories proposed to describe symmetry-preserving Luttinger surfaces, i.e., the momentum-space manifolds of Green's function zeros (GFZs) at zero energy, in strongly interacting fermionic systems. In particular, we focus on simplest possible cases associated with a gapless Dirac zero, which is the counterpart of the gapless Dirac quasiparticle in weakly interacting systems. These theories may be derived by integrating out low-energy degrees of freedom that do not couple to the relevant gauge field. We discuss the global anomaly, the bulk-boundary correspondence, and the constraint on phases consistent with the anomaly, such as non-Fermi liquids and emergent gapless quasiparticles on Luttinger surfaces. Failing to avoid a spontaneous symmetry breaking in the thermodynamical limit inevitably leads unstable GFZs. We also provide some perspectives on why the related nonlocal fermionic effective theory studied recently is not a suitable starting point for a symmetrically gapped phase.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2405.08093v5</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Lecture Notes on Quantum Many-Body Theory: A Pedagogical Introduction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09229</link><description>arXiv:2507.09229v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: We investigate the Sagnac and Mashhoon effects in graphene, taking into account both the pseudospin and intrinsic spin of electrons, within a simplified model of a rotating nanotube or infinitesimally narrow ring. Based on considerations of the relativistic phase of the wave function and employing the effective Larmor theorem, we demonstrate that the Sagnac fringe shift retains a form analogous to that for free electrons, governed by the electron's vacuum mass. In the case of a narrow ring, an additional $\pi$-phase shift arises due to the Berry phase associated with the honeycomb graphene lattice. The Mashhoon fringe shift retains its conventional form, with its dependence on the Fermi velocity.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.07718v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Magnon squeezing near a quantum critical point in a cavity-magnon-qubit system</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24295</link><description>arXiv:2509.24295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preparing magnon nonclassical states is a central topic in the study of quantum magnonics. Here we propose to generate magnon squeezed states in a hybrid cavity-magnon-qubit system by engineering an effective Rabi-type magnon-qubit interaction. This is achieved by adiabatically eliminating the cavity mode and driving the qubit with two microwave fields, of which the driving frequencies and amplitudes are properly selected. By operating the system around the critical point associated with the ground-state superradiant phase transition in the normal phase, a magnon parametric amplification-like interaction is induced, leading to a dynamical magnon squeezing. We further analyze the effects of the dissipation, dephasing, and thermal noise on the magnon squeezing. Our results indicate that a moderate degree of squeezing can be produced using currently available parameters in the experiments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.24295v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] How to Build Anomalous (3+1)d Topological Quantum Field Theories</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24834</link><description>arXiv:2510.24834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic framework for constructing (3+1)-dimensional topological orders or topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) that realize specified anomalies of finite symmetries, as encountered in gauge theories with fermions or in fermionic lattice systems. Our approach generalizes the symmetry-extension construction to the fermionic setting, and is grounded in recent advances in the categorical classification of anomalous TQFTs in (3+1)d. In this framework, symmetry-extension data of a supercohomology theory are translated into a fusion 2-category, on which the anomalous TQFT is built. Building on this machinery, we demonstrate explicit calculations for various symmetry groups and their associated anomalies, with the help of a hastened Adams spectral sequence for computing supercohomology groups which we will detail in a planned sequel. Finally, we prove that all supercohomology anomalies can be realized by fermionic topological orders, whereas beyond-supercohomology anomalies cannot, resolving a question of C\'ordova--Ohmori for fermionic (3+1)d systems with finite symmetries.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.24834v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] IEPDYN: Integral-equation formalism of population dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09187</link><description>arXiv:2601.09187v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the integral-equation formalism of population dynamics (IEPDYN) to describe the population dynamics of distinct configurational states. According to classical reaction dynamics theory, the probability density associated with a given state obeys the Liouville equation, including influx from and efflux to neighboring states. By introducing a Markov approximation for the crossing of boundaries separating the states, tractable integral equations governing the state populations are derived. Once the time-dependent quantities appearing in these equations are evaluated, the population dynamics on long timescales can be obtained. Because these quantities depend only on a few states in the local neighborhood of a given state, they can be computed using a set of short-timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The IEPDYN method is formulated in continuous time and therefore does not rely on a coarse-grained timescale (lag time). Consequently, kinetic quantities obtained from IEPDYN are free from lag-time dependence, which has been discussed as a limitation in other approaches. We apply the IEPDYN method to the binding and unbinding kinetics of CH$_4$/CH$_4$, Na$^+$/Cl$^-$, and 18-crown-6-ether (crown ether)/K$^+$ in water. For both kinetics, the time constants estimated from the IEPDYN method are almost comparable to those obtained from brute-force MD simulations. The required timescale of each MD trajectory in the IEPDYN method is approximately two orders of magnitude shorter than that in the brute-force MD approach in the crown ether/K$^+$ system. This reduction in the trajectory timescale enables applications to complex binding and unbinding systems whose characteristic timescales are far beyond those directly accessible by brute-force MD simulations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09187v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Interconnect-Aware Logic Resynthesis for Multi-Die FPGAs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19720</link><description>arXiv:2602.19720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-die FPGAs enable device scaling beyond reticle limits but introduce severe interconnect overhead across die boundaries. Inter-die connections, commonly referred to as super-long lines (SLLs), incur high delay and consume scarce interposer interconnect resources, often dominating critical paths and complicating physical design. To address this, this work proposes an interconnect-aware logic resynthesis method that restructures the LUT-level netlist to reduce the number of SLLs. The resynthesis engine uses die partitioning information to apply logic resubstitutions, which simplifies local circuit structures and eliminates SLLs. By reducing the number of SLLs early in the design flow, prior to physical implementation, the proposed method shortens critical paths, alleviates pressure on scarce interposer interconnect resources, and improves overall physical design flexibility. We further build a tool flow for multi-die FPGAs by integrating the proposed resynthesis method with packing and placement. Experimental results on the EPFL benchmarks show that, compared with a state-of-the-art framework, the proposed method reduces the number of SLLs by up to 24.8% for a 2-die FPGA and up to 27.38% for a 3-die FPGA. On MCNC benchmarks, our tool flow achieves an average SLL reduction of 1.65% while preserving placement quality. On Koios benchmarks, where fewer removable SLLs exist, several designs still exhibit considerable inter-die edge reductions. Overall, the results confirm that reducing inter-die connections at the logic level is an effective approach for multi-die FPGAs.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.19720v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Hardware-Friendly Randomization: Enabling Random-Access and Minimal Wiring in FHE Accelerators with Low Total Cost</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19550</link><description>arXiv:2602.19550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ring-Learning With Errors (RLWE) problem forms the backbone of highly efficient Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) schemes. A significant component of the RLWE public key and ciphertext of the form $(b,a)$ is the uniformly random polynomial $a \in R_q$ . While essential for security, the communication overhead of transmitting $a$ from client to server, and inputting it into a hardware accelerator, can be substantial, especially for FHE accelerators aiming at high acceleration factors. A known technique in reducing this overhead generates $a$ from a small seed on the client side via a deterministic process, transmits only the seed, and generates $a$ on-the-fly within the accelerator. Challenges in the hardware implementation of an accelerator include wiring (density and power), compute area, compute power as well as flexibility in scheduling of on-the-fly generation instructions. This extended abstract proposes a concrete scheme and parameters wherein these practical challenges are addressed. We detail the benefits of our approach, which maintains the reduction in communication latency and memory footprint, while allowing parallel generation of uniformly distributed samples, relaxed wiring requirements, unrestricted randomaccess to RNS limbs, and results in an extremely low overhead on the client side (i.e. less than 3%) during the key generation process. The proposed scheme eliminates the need for thick metal layers for randomness distribution and prevents the power consumption of the PRNG subsystem from scaling prohibitively with the acceleration factor, potentially saving tens of Watts per accelerator chip in high-throughput configurations.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.19550v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] QiMeng-CodeV-R1: Reasoning-Enhanced Verilog Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24183</link><description>arXiv:2505.24183v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained via reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) have achieved breakthroughs on tasks with explicit, automatable verification, such as software programming and mathematical problems. Extending RLVR to electronic design automation (EDA), especially automatically generating hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog from natural-language (NL) specifications, however, poses three key challenges: the lack of automated and accurate verification environments, the scarcity of high-quality NL-code pairs, and the prohibitive computation cost of RLVR. To this end, we introduce CodeV-R1, an RLVR framework for training Verilog generation LLMs. First, we develop a rule-based testbench generator that performs robust equivalence checking against golden references. Second, we propose a round-trip data synthesis method that pairs open-source Verilog snippets with LLM-generated NL descriptions, verifies code-NL-code consistency via the generated testbench, and filters out inequivalent examples to yield a high-quality dataset. Third, we employ a two-stage "distill-then-RL" training pipeline: distillation for the cold start of reasoning abilities, followed by adaptive DAPO, our novel RLVR algorithm that can reduce training cost by adaptively adjusting sampling rate. The resulting model, CodeV-R1-7B, achieves 68.6% and 72.9% pass@1 on VerilogEval v2 and RTLLM v1.1, respectively, surpassing prior state-of-the-art by 12~20%, while even exceeding the performance of 671B DeepSeek-R1 on RTLLM. We have released our model, training code, and dataset to facilitate research in EDA and LLM communities.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.24183v5</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] The landscape of tissue-resident microbiota across normal, polyp, and colorectal cancer tissues</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69705-5</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 24 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69705-5"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-69705-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Colorectal cancer has been associated with changes in tissue-resident microbiota.

Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging, we compared the effects of isoflurane, propofol, and ketamine—administered at equivalent sedative depth based on behavioral reflex suppression—on excitatory neurons and inhibitory interneuron subtypes (PV and SST) in the mouse somatosensory cortex. All anesthetics suppressed excitatory and inhibitory neuronal activity at the population level.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00515-8?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Association between adipokine and metabolic dysfunction-related fatty liver disease in plateau-dwelling populations</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00513-4?rss=yes</link><description>Previous research on the relationship between adipokines and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease(MASLD) has predominantly focused on low-altitude populations, despite the well-documented impact of environmental stressors on adipokine expression. This study sought to explore the relationship between adipokines and MASLD across various metabolic subtypes, and to develop a predictive model for MASLD screening in high-altitude regions. This study included 750 indigenous plateau residents from the China Multi-Ethnic Cohort (CMEC).</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid

Abstract: Scale invariance is a central organizing principle in physics, underlying phenomena that range from critical behaviour in statistical mechanics to transport and chaos in nonlinear dynamical systems. Here we present a unified and physically motivated exploration of scaling concepts, emphasizing how invariance under rescaling transformations emerges across systems of increasing dynamical complexity. Rather than adopting a purely abstract approach, we combine simple geometrical constructions, analytical arguments, and prototypical dynamical models to build physical intuition. We begin with elementary, easily reproducible examples governed by a single control parameter, showing how power-law behaviour naturally arises when characteristic scales are absent. We then extend the discussion to nonlinear dynamical systems exhibiting local bifurcations, where two scaling variables control the relaxation toward stationary states. In this context, scaling invariance manifests through critical exponents, crossover phenomena, and critical slowing down, allowing systems of different dimensionality to be grouped into universality classes. Finally, we address continuous phase transitions in chaotic dynamical systems, including transitions from integrability to non-integrability and from bounded to unbounded diffusion. By drawing on concepts traditionally associated with statistical mechanics, such as order parameters, susceptibilities, symmetry breaking, elementary excitations, and topological defects, we show how these transitions can be interpreted within a coherent scaling framework. Taken together, the examples discussed here demonstrate that scaling invariance provides a unifying language for understanding structure, transport, and criticality in nonlinear systems, bridging deterministic dynamics and nonequilibrium statistical physics in a transparent and physically intuitive manner.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.17839v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Microwave Imaging of Edge Conductivity in Graphene at Charge Neutrality and Quantum Hall States</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17906</link><description>arXiv:2602.17906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report local conductivity imaging of edge states in monolayer graphene by millikelvin microwave impedance microscopy (MIM). At the charge-neutrality point, as the magnetic field increases, the local conductivity at the edge drops to zero more slowly than in the bulk. This behavior is consistent with the calculated spatial profile of the charge gap in the canted antiferromagnetic phase. For comparison, we also perform microwave imaging of integer quantum Hall states away from neutrality, which host dissipationless chiral edge channels. The evolution of the edge signal as a function of the bulk gap is fundamentally different between the Landau level filling factor $\nu = 0$ and $|\nu| \ge 1$ integer quantum Hall states, which can be qualitatively explained by numerical simulations and theoretical analysis. Our results provide a comprehensive microscopic picture of the edge and bulk states as the Fermi level moves across the unique Landau-level spectrum of graphene.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.17906v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Method for real-time monitoring of paramagnetic reactions using spin relaxometry with fluorescent nanodiamonds</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17965</link><description>arXiv:2602.17965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin relaxometry using fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) has been applied successfully to sense numerous paramagnetic target molecules such as free radicals and metalloproteins. However, despite their high sensitivity, T1 spin relaxation measurements are often hampered by their slow acquisition speed. Here, we demonstrate a method that allows for real-time monitoring of paramagnetic chemical reactions. We demonstrate T1 spin relaxometry from thousands of FNDs using an optimised cuvette-based system integrating an avalanche photodiode operated in linear mode, and a fast, fieldprogrammable gate array (FPGA) for data collation. We demonstrate chemical monitoring of the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) ions in-solution with a 15 second integration using an optimised T1 sensing protocol. Our method achieves more than two orders of magnitude speed up with an order of magnitude reduction in cost when compared with traditional techniques. With further technical improvements, we believe this in-solution method could be extended to sense the sub-second chemical kinetics of paramagnetic molecules in solution.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.17965v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Second-Coordination-Sphere Cation Substitution as a Tool for Controlling Phase Transitions and Performance of the Luminescence Thermometry</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18167</link><description>arXiv:2602.18167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the exceptionally high relative sensitivities achieved by luminescent thermometers based on first-order structural phase transitions, their principal limitation lies in the inherently narrow thermal operating range associated with the transition temperature. In this work, we demonstrate that partial substitution of Li+ by Na+ ions in the second coordination sphere of Eu3+ ions in LiYO2 enables a substantial shift of the phase transition temperature, thereby allowing controlled optimization of the thermometric performance. This approach represents a significantly more cost-effective and efficient strategy for tuning the phase transition temperature compared with the previously proposed substitution of Y3+ by other lanthanide ions. Importantly, we show that lowering the transition temperature through Na+ incorporation simultaneously introduces static compositional disorder and local lattice strain. As a consequence, the enthalpy difference between the competing structural phases decreases, and the cooperativity of the lattice distortion is reduced, indicating a gradual weakening of the first-order character of the phase transition. Our results demonstrate that such structural modifications, while effective in shifting the transition temperature, inevitably lead to a reduction in the relative sensitivity of phase-transition-based luminescent thermometers.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.18167v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Magnetic Force Imaging of 2D Topological Insulators</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18281</link><description>arXiv:2602.18281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators are central to our understanding of the connection between topological symmetries in a material and its band electronics. Within this class of materials, a breadth of complex quantum behaviors, such as persistent spin-polarized current states in the presence of a broken time reversal symmetry, and temperature-independent topological protection of quantum states, are thought to exist. However, current studies using photoemission and spectroscopic analyses or transport experiments fail to provide insight into the interplay between the physical 2D manifold and the band topology itself, since they do not provide spatial resolution of the phenomena to be understood. In this work, we develop a methodology for applying magnetic force microscopy to such systems to address this issue. Using well-characterized 2D crystallites of bismuth telluride ($Bi_2$$Te_3$), we image the magnetic signal directly associated with topological edge states. The observed phase contrast is remarkably robust at a temperature of 25{\deg}C and occurs across crystallite sizes and shapes. A detailed analysis of the magnetic imaging suggests that the current observed is composed of two parts: the first is a persistent current ($I_{Persistent}$) as predicted by theory, and the second is due to Faraday induction, $I_{Faraday}$. Damping dynamics of the cantilever during imaging further suggest that this Faraday EMF is established by spin accumulation along the 1D edge channel of the crystal, which then converts to a charge current in the presence of time reversal symmetry breaking, creating a novel form of rectification in the channel. This unexpected result can prompt new ideas for topology-based circuit elements with extremely low losses and power consumption.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.18281v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Toroidal Fermi-surface geometry and phonon-limited transport in nodal-line semimetals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18303</link><description>arXiv:2602.18303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nodal-line semimetals (NLSs) can display unconventional quasiparticle dynamics and charge transport properties due to their extended band degeneracy and the peculiar geometry of their Fermi surface. We consider electron-acoustic phonon scattering as the dominant relaxation mechanism and compute the quasiparticle decay rate and dc conductivity by solving the linearized semiclassical Boltzmann equation in a minimal model of a doped circular NLS. We find that the toroidal geometry of the Fermi surface gives rise to two parametrically distinct Bloch-Gr\"uneisen temperatures, associated with momentum transfers along the poloidal and toroidal directions, respectively. As a result, an intermediate temperature window opens between these two scales, in which the decay rate follows $\Gamma\propto T^2$, while the conductivity follows $\sigma\propto T^{-2}$. We also obtain the low- and high-temperature asymptotic behaviors, and discuss implications for ARPES and transport measurements in candidate NLS materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.18303v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Responsive Disorder in a Metal-Organic Framework Enables Solid-State Reservoir Computing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18335</link><description>arXiv:2602.18335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex systems with nonlinear response mechanisms can be applied as reservoir computers for energy-efficient machine learning tasks. Historically explored at the macro- and meso-scale, physical reservoir computing has recently been extended to the atomic scale via chemical mixtures with strong and dynamic heterogeneity. Here we explore the possibility that configurational degeneracy within disordered materials might form the basis for solid-state atomic-scale reservoirs. Our proof-of-concept uses the disordered metal-organic framework DUT-8, which undergoes a series of disorder-disorder transitions on exposure to different guest species. We show that variations in X-ray diffuse scattering associated with these transitions function as suitable readouts for machine learning applications. A combination of nonlinearity and memory effects in the DUT-8 response allows the system to carry out both classification and time-series machine learning tasks with accuracies comparable to those of mesoscale physical reservoir computers. Our results suggest a new avenue for exploiting correlated disorder in solid phases whenever the nature of that disorder can be modulated through external perturbations-a phenomenon we term `responsive disorder'.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.18335v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Phase-field simulations of nucleation, growth, and coarsening of $\beta_1$ precipitates in Mg-Nd alloys</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18430</link><description>arXiv:2602.18430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial distribution and morphology of precipitates formed during aging are key factors that determine the precipitation hardening response of various magnesium-rare earth alloys. In recent years, the use of high-performance computing clusters and massively parallel frameworks has enabled quantitative simulations of the evolution of individual and multiple precipitates at relevant length and time scales. However, predictive modeling of precipitate evolution remains challenging, in part because many key thermodynamic and kinetic parameters governing the underlying physics are either unknown or have a high degree of uncertainty. In this work, we developed a workflow in which experimental data were used to parameterize a phase-field model to perform two-dimensional (2D) simulations of concurrent nucleation and evolution of $\beta_1$ precipitates in magnesium-neodymium alloy during aging. Matrix composition and precipitate number density at different aging times were obtained from atom probe tomography and transmission electron microscopy measurements, respectively. We applied a stereological method to estimate the three-dimensional (3D) number densities from experimental cross-sectional transmission electron micrographs. The estimated 3D number density data were then converted to effective 2D number densities. The effective 2D number density and composition data were used to determine the required model parameters by minimizing the discrepancy between simulation and experimental results. The parameterized model allows for quantitative phase-field simulations of nucleation and growth of $\beta_1$ precipitates, which can be employed to optimize aging time to achieve a target number density of precipitates. This work highlights an approach to overcome the challenges associated with parameterizing a coupled phase-field and nucleation model.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.18430v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Phase diagram of a lattice fermion model with symmetric mass generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18360</link><description>arXiv:2602.18360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phase structure of a model containing two flavors of massless staggered fermions interacting through two independent four-fermion couplings, UI and UB, formulated on a three-dimensional Euclidean space-time lattice. At UB = 0, this model is known to exhibit a direct second-order quantum phase transition between a massless fermion (MF) phase and a phase in which fermions acquire masses through the mechanism commonly referred to as symmetric mass generation (SMG). We demonstrate that introducing a small nonzero value of UB qualitatively alters this structure: the single exotic transition at UB = 0 splits into two distinct, conventional transitions, separated by an intermediate phase in which fermion masses arise through the standard mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). The first of these is a Gross-Neveu transition separating the MF phase from the SSB-induced massive phase, while the second is a three-dimensional XY transition between the SSB phase and the SMG phase. Using the fermion-bag Monte Carlo method, we verify that the critical exponents associated with both transitions are consistent with the literature, thereby yielding a quantitative characterization of the resulting phase structure of the model.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.18360v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Ori-Sense: origami capacitive sensing for soft robotic applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18379</link><description>arXiv:2602.18379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces Ori-Sense, a compliant capacitive sensor inspired by the inverted Kresling origami pattern.

Using dissolvable-core molding, we fabricated a monolithic silicone structure with embedded conductive TPU electrodes, forming an integrated soft capacitor. Mechanical characterization revealed low stiffness and minimal impedance, with torque values below 0.01 N mm for axial displacements between -15 mm and 15 mm, and up to 0.03 N mm at 30 degrees twist under compression. Finite-element simulations confirmed localized stresses along fold lines and validated the measured torque-rotation response. Electrical tests showed consistent capacitance modulation up to 30%, directly correlated with the twist angle, and maximal sensitivity of S_theta ~ 0.0067 pF/deg at 5 mm of axial deformation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.18379v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Snapping Actuators with Asymmetric and Sequenced Motion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18421</link><description>arXiv:2602.18421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Snapping instabilities in soft structures offer a powerful pathway to achieve rapid and energy-efficient actuation. In this study, an eccentric dome-shaped snapping actuator is developed to generate controllable asymmetric motion through geometry-induced instability. Finite element simulations and experiments reveal consistent asymmetric deformation and the corresponding pressure characteristics. By coupling four snapping actuators in a pneumatic network, a compact quadrupedal robot achieves coordinated wavelike locomotion using only a single pressure input. The robot exhibits frequency-dependent performance with a maximum speed of 72.78~mm/s at 7.5~Hz. These findings demonstrate the potential of asymmetric snapping mechanisms for physically controlled actuation and lay the groundwork for fully untethered and efficient soft robotic systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.18421v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Twisted bilayer graphene as a terahertz plasmonic crystal</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03781</link><description>arXiv:2509.03781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study surface plasmons in minimally-twisted gapped bilayer graphene that contains a triangular network of partial dislocations (or AB-BA domain walls) hosting topologically protected one-dimensional electronic states. We show that this system behaves as a plasmonic crystal and we calculate its band structure by solving classical equations of motion for charge dynamics on the network links with impedance boundary conditions at the network nodes. The plasmon dispersion exhibits several notable features such as multiple gapless branches, flat bands, and dissipationless modes at high-symmetry points. We compare our network-based formalism with the conventional random phase approximation and discuss when each approach is valid.

Abstract: The response of a MoRe-based superconducting resonator operating near 5 K to pulsed infrared irradiation is investigated, and the underlying physical mechanisms are analyzed. The device exhibits a pronounced nonlinear response dominated by nonequilibrium quasiparticle dynamics rather than uniform thermal heating. Infrared pulses produce strong distortions of the resonance curve and a transient decrease in the resonance frequency, consistent with increased kinetic inductance caused by quasiparticle generation. The frequency shift scales approximately linearly with absorbed power, whereas the dissipation response saturates at higher powers, indicating the formation of a nonequilibrium steady-state quasiparticle population. These observations demonstrate a transition from a linear pair-breaking regime to a saturated dissipation regime, likely associated with a quasiparticle relaxation bottleneck or partial suppression of the smaller superconducting gap in MoRe. The results highlight the relevance of nonequilibrium processes in MoRe and confirm its potential for microwave kinetic-inductance detector applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.23090v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Exploring the Thermodynamic, Elastic, and Optical properties of LaRh2X2 (X = Al, Ga, In) low Tc Superconductors through First-Principles Calculations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01300</link><description>arXiv:2601.01300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LaRh2X2 (X = Al, Ga, In) compounds crystallize in a tetragonal layered ThCr2Si2-type structure and belong to a family of low critical temperature superconductors. Using first-principles density functional theory calculations implemented in the CASTEP code, we systematically investigated their structural, mechanical, elastic, electronic, vibrational, thermophysical, and optical properties for the first time. The optimized structural parameters show good agreement with available experimental data. The Born stability criteria and negative formation energies confirm the mechanical and thermodynamic stability of these materials. Poisson and Pugh ratios indicate a ductile nature, while low Debye and melting temperatures together with low Vickers hardness suggest that the compounds are relatively soft. The electronic band structures and density of states reveal metallic behavior. Charge density distribution and Mulliken population analysis indicate mixed covalent, ionic, and metallic bonding. The calculated Fermi surfaces contain both hole-like and electron-like sheets, suggesting possible multiband characteristics. Phonon dispersion analysis confirms the dynamical stability of LaRh2Al2 and LaRh2Ga2, while LaRh2In2 shows dynamical instability associated with a possible structural phase transition. Optical property analysis indicates that these superconductors may be promising candidates for high-density optical data storage applications. The estimated electron-phonon coupling constant of about 0.56 indicates that LaRh2X2 compounds are weakly coupled low critical temperature superconductors.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01300v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A gradient flow perspective on McKean-Vlasov equations in econophysics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05696</link><description>arXiv:2411.05696v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Gini coefficient of economic inequality is a Lyapunov functional for a class of nonlinear, nonlocal integro-differential equations arising at the intersection of mathematics, economics, and statistical physics. Next, a novel Riemannian geometry is imposed on a subset of probability densities such that the evolutionary dynamics are formally driven by the Gini coefficient functional as a gradient flow. Thus in the same way that classical 2-Wasserstein theory connects heat flow and the Second Law of Thermodynamics by way of Boltzmann entropy, the work here gives rise to a principle of econophysics that is much of the same flavor but for the Gini coefficient.
  The noncanonical Onsager operators associated to the metric tensors are derived and some transport inequalities proven. The new metric relates to the dual norm of a second-order Sobolev-like factor space, in a similar way to how the classical 2-Wasserstein metric linearizes as the dual norm of a first-order, homogeneous Sobolev space.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.05696v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Expediting quantum state transfer through the long-range extended XY model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16196</link><description>arXiv:2501.16196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Going beyond short-range interactions, we explore the role of long-range interactions in the extended XY model for transferring quantum states through evolution. In particular, employing a spin-1/2 chain with interactions decaying as a power law, we demonstrate that long-range (LR) interactions significantly enhance the efficiency of a quantum state transfer (QST) protocol, improving the achievable fidelity, mitigating its slow decline as compared with the nearest-neighbor setting, associated with increasing system-size. Our study identifies the LR regime as providing an optimal balance between interaction range and transfer efficiency, outperforming the protocol with the short-range interacting model. Our detailed analysis reveals the impact of system parameters, such as anisotropy, magnetic field strength, and coordination number, on QST dynamics. Specifically, we find that intermediate coordination numbers lead to a faster and more reliable state transfer, while extreme values diminish performance. Furthermore, we exhibit that the presence of LR interactions considerably reduces the minimum time required to achieve fidelity beyond the classical limit.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.16196v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Topological Magneto-optical Kerr Effect without Spin-orbit Coupling in Spin-compensated Antiferromagnet</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09493</link><description>arXiv:2507.09493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE), the differential reflection of oppositely circularly polarized light, has traditionally been associated with relativistic spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which links a particle's spin with its orbital motion. In ferromagnets, large MOKE signals arise from the combination of magnetization and SOC, while in certain coplanar antiferromagnets, SOC-induced Berry curvature enables MOKE despite zero net magnetization. Theoretically, large MOKE can also arise in a broader class of magnetic materials with compensated spins, without relying on SOC - for example, in systems exhibiting real-space scalar spin chirality. The experimental verification has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate such a SOC- and magnetization-free MOKE in the noncoplanar antiferromagnet Co1/3TaS2. Using a Sagnac interferometer microscope, we image domains of scalar spin chirality and their reversal. Our findings establish experimentally a new mechanism for generating large MOKE signals and position chiral spin textures in compensated magnets as a compelling platform for ultrafast, stray-field-immune opto-spintronic applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.09493v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Inhomogeneous SSH models and the doubling of orthogonal polynomials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15527</link><description>arXiv:2511.15527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models using the doubling method for orthogonal polynomial sequences. This approach yields the analytical spectrum and exact eigenstates of the models. We demonstrate that the standard SSH model is associated with the doubling of Chebyshev polynomials. Extending this technique to the doubling of other finite sequences enables the construction of Hamiltonians for inhomogeneous SSH models which are exactly solvable. We detail the specific cases associated with Krawtchouk and $q$-Racah polynomials. This work highlights the utility of polynomial-doubling techniques in obtaining exact solutions for physical models.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.15527v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] J3DAI: A tiny DNN-Based Edge AI Accelerator for 3D-Stacked CMOS Image Sensor</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15316</link><description>arXiv:2506.15316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents J3DAI, a tiny deep neural network-based hardware accelerator for a 3-layer 3D-stacked CMOS image sensor featuring an artificial intelligence (AI) chip integrating a Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based accelerator. The DNN accelerator is designed to efficiently perform neural network tasks such as image classification and segmentation. This paper focuses on the digital system of J3DAI, highlighting its Performance-Power-Area (PPA) characteristics and showcasing advanced edge AI capabilities on a CMOS image sensor. To support hardware, we utilized the Aidge comprehensive software framework, which enables the programming of both the host processor and the DNN accelerator. Aidge supports post-training quantization, significantly reducing memory footprint and computational complexity, making it crucial for deploying models on resource-constrained hardware like J3DAI. Our experimental results demonstrate the versatility and efficiency of this innovative design in the field of edge AI, showcasing its potential to handle both simple and computationally intensive tasks. Future work will focus on further optimizing the architecture and exploring new applications to fully leverage the capabilities of J3DAI. As edge AI continues to grow in importance, innovations like J3DAI will play a crucial role in enabling real-time, low-latency, and energy-efficient AI processing at the edge.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.15316v2</guid></item><item><title>[Nature] Music is not a universal language — but it can bring us together when words fail</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00565-1</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature, Published online: 23 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00565-1"&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-026-00565-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Societies, animals and even machines have music in common.

Using benchmark regression and a mediating effect model, this study explores how new quality productivity (NQP) impacts carbon emissions from cultural consumption. Findings reveal a non-linear "first promoting, then inhibiting" effect of NQP on such emissions. It is worth noting that cultural innovation (CI) serves as a transmission mechanism through which NQP exert an inverted U-shaped relationship on the HCT in cultural consumption.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00414-1?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] A MOF-Lanthanide Theranostic Agent with Bidirectional Near-Infrared Photon Conversion for Tumor-Responsive Therapy and Real-Time Imaging</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c21676</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c21676/asset/images/medium/ja5c21676_0007.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c21676&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2026 19:54:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c21676</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] MSA-2 Loaded Three-Dimensional Metal Covalent Organic Framework for Synergistic Radiosensitization and Innate Immune Activation</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c19020</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c19020/asset/images/medium/ja5c19020_0007.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c19020&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2026 19:41:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c19020</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] C–H Nucleophilic Substitution for the Diversity-Oriented Modification of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c20219</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c20219/asset/images/medium/ja5c20219_0007.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c20219&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2026 19:09:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c20219</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Revealing the Full Potential of Glycolated Mixed Ionic-Electronic Semiconductors – Symmetric Monomer Polymerization to Boost Electrochemical Transistor Performance</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c19024</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c19024/asset/images/medium/ja5c19024_0008.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c19024&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2026 18:55:04 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c19024</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Aqueous Magnesium-Ion Battery Anode with 75,000 Cycles Lifespan</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c21656</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c21656/asset/images/medium/ja5c21656_0006.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c21656&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2026 18:42:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c21656</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Nano Energy] Mechanistic insight into mechanically-driven catalysis through modulation of surface electrostatics in high-entropy perovskites</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211285526000601?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: April 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;

Abstract: Chirality in polymeric systems enables a wide range of emergent optical, mechanical, and transport phenomena, yet a unified framework that quantitatively connects molecular-scale geometry to chiral behavior remains lacking. Existing theoretical descriptions typically emphasize either continuum models, such as the helical wormlike chain (HWLC), which neglect intermolecular interactions, or mesophase-level theories, which obscure the role of molecular geometry. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive framework for quantifying chirality in helical polymers by extending the Kremer-Grest bead-spring model to explicitly map intrinsic curvature and torsion onto bond angle and dihedral potentials. We establish direct theoretical relationships between helical parameters such as pitch and radius, and connect them to a normalized, dimensionless chirality characteristic, $\chi$ that captures local geometric correlations absent from conventional HWLC descriptions. Furthermore, using molecular dynamics simulations, we systematically quantify the influence of excluded volume interactions and thermal fluctuations on helical geometry and chirality, dispelling the common assumption that monotonic increases in chirality are associated only with decreasing pitch. Finally, we present a coarse-graining procedure that facilitates a direct comparison between experimental helical polymers and the Kremer-Grest helical chain, demonstrating quantitative agreement across a diverse set of polymer classes. This unified geometric and particle-based description provides a predictive roadmap for selecting and engineering chiral Kremer-Grest models and offers a general platform for designing polymeric materials with controlled and tunable chirality.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.16912v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Vibrational Instabilities in Charge Transport through Molecular Nanojunctions: The Role of Anharmonic Nuclear Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17207</link><description>arXiv:2602.17207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current-induced vibrational dynamics is a key factor determining the stability of molecular nanojunctions. Beyond conventional Joule heating, a different mechanism caused by nonconservative current-induced forces has been predicted for models with multiple vibrational modes, leading to vibrational instabilities already at low bias voltages. So far, this mechanism has only been investigated in models with harmonic nuclear potentials. Consequently, a natural question is whether this effect can also be observed in more realistic models containing anharmonic nuclear potentials, and, if so, whether it has a measurable impact on observables such as the junction dissociation probability. In this work, we apply a mixed quantum-classical approach based on electronic friction and Langevin dynamics to various anharmonic two-mode systems. By performing Langevin simulations of the vibrational dynamics, we investigate the influence of anharmonicity on instabilities arising from nonconservative forces and the corresponding dissociation dynamics of the junction, as well as steady-state observables, such as the electronic current.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.17207v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Low-Field Ferroelectric Switching realised by Forced Harmonic Oscillation of Domain Walls</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17266</link><description>arXiv:2602.17266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventionally, dc fields are used for switching dipole orientations in ferroelectrics. Such fields tilt the potential surface experienced by domain walls and thereby lower activation energies for their movement: escape from tilted potential wells is then realised by thermal excitation, allowing a "creep" process of pinning and depinning to develop. Borrowing ideas of domain wall resonance from the magnetic racetrack community, we show that ac fields, applied at the right frequency, can cause switching at much lower field magnitudes than dc ones (by factors of 4-5). Ferroelectric wall motion appears to be overdamped in the system studied (relaxor strontium barium niobate) and so the maximum in switching efficacy observed, at ~100 kHz, cannot be associated with resonant amplification, which needs an underdamped environment. Instead, in this high viscosity system, the frequency at which the maximum switching efficacy occurs seems to represent a compromise between the attempt frequency for wall depinning (which increases with frequency) and the extent to which energy is transferred to the wall within each field cycle (which decreases with frequency). Notwithstanding the absence of true resonance, the observation that ac excitation can dramatically reduce the bias levels needed for ferroelectric switching could still have significant ramifications for low energy memory technology.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.17266v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Measuring spectral functions of doped magnets with Rydberg tweezer arrays</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17600</link><description>arXiv:2602.17600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic measurements of single-particle spectral functions provide crucial insight into strongly correlated quantum matter by resolving the energy and spatial structure of elementary excitations. Here we introduce a spectroscopic protocol for single-charge injection with simultaneous spatial and energy resolution in a Rydberg tweezer array, effectively emulating scanning tunneling microscopy. By combining this protocol with single-atom-resolved imaging, we go beyond conventional spectroscopy by not only measuring the single-particle spectral function but also directly imaging the microscopic structure of the excitations underlying spectral resonances in frustrated $tJ$ Hamiltonians. We reveal resonances associated with the formation of bound magnetic polarons -- composite quasiparticles consisting of a mobile hole bound to a magnon -- and directly extract their binding energy, spatial extent, and spin character. Finally, by exploiting the spatial tunability of our platform, we measure the local density of states across different lattice geometries. Our work establishes Rydberg tweezer arrays as a powerful platform for spectroscopic studies of strongly correlated models, offering microscopic control and direct real-space access to emergent quasiparticles in engineered quantum matter.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.17600v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Phonon-enhanced strain sensitivity of quantum dots in two-dimensional semiconductors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17212</link><description>arXiv:2602.17212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional semiconductors have attracted considerable interest for integration into emerging quantum photonic networks. Strain engineering of monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (ML-TMDs) enables the tuning of light-matter interactions and associated optoelectronic properties, and generates new functionalities, including the formation of quantum dots (QDs). Here, we combine spatially resolved micro-photoluminescence ($\mu$-PL) spectroscopy from cryogenic (4$\text{-}$94 K) to room temperature with micro-Raman spectroscopy at room temperature to investigate the strain-dependent emission energies of thousands of individual QDs in ML-WS$_2$ and ML-WSe$_2$, integrated across multiple heterostructures and a piezoelectric device. Compared with delocalized excitons, QDs in both materials exhibit enhanced strain sensitivities of their emission energies $-$ approximately fourfold in WS$_2$ and twofold in WSe$_2$ $-$ leading to pronounced broadening of the ensemble emission linewidth. Temperature-dependent $\mu$-PL spectroscopy combined with dynamic strain tuning experiments further reveal that the enhanced strain sensitivity of individual QDs originates from strengthened interactions with low-energy phonons induced by quantum confinement. Our results demonstrate a versatile strain-engineering approach with potential for spectral matching across solid-state, atomic, and hybrid quantum photonic networks, and provide new insights into phonon-QD interactions in two-dimensional semiconductors.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.17212v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Weyl semimetallic state with antiferromagnetic order in Rashba-Hubbard model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02131</link><description>arXiv:2402.02131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the phase diagram of Rashba-Hubbard model by employing the Hartree-Fock meanfield theory, and thereby establish the existence of an antiferromagnetically ordered Weyl semimetallic state with in-plane magnetic moments. This phase is found to be sandwiched in between the antiferromagnetic insulator and Rashba metal in the interaction vs spin-orbit coupling phase diagram. The antiferromagnetically-ordered topological semimetallic state exists in the presence of combined time-reversal and inversion symmetry though individually both are broken. The study of the static magnetic susceptibility indicates the robustness of the antiferromagnetic order within a realistic range of interaction and spin-orbit coupling parameters. In addition to the edge states associated with the Weyl points, we also investigate the spin-resolved quasiparticle interference, which provides important insight into the possible spin texture of the bands especially in the vicinity of Weyl points.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2402.02131v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Magnetic moment of electrons in systems with spin-orbit coupling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10956</link><description>arXiv:2503.10956v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic effects originating from spin-orbit coupling (SOC) have been attracting major attention. However, SOC contributions to the electron magnetic moment operator are conventionally disregarded. In this work, we analyze relativistic contributions to the latter operator, including those of the SOC-type: in vacuum, for the semiconductor 8 band Kane model, and for an arbitrary system with two spectral branches. In this endeavor, we introduce a notion of relativistic corrections to the operation $\partial/\partial\boldsymbol B$, where $\boldsymbol B$ is an external magnetic field. We highlight the difference between the magnetic moment and $-\partial H/\partial\boldsymbol B$, where $H$ is the system Hamiltonian. We suggest to call this difference the abnormal magnetic moment. We demonstrate that the conventional decomposition of the total magnetic moment into the spin and orbital parts becomes ambiguous when relativistic corrections are taken into account. The latter also jeopardize the "modern theory of orbital magnetization" in its standard formulation. We derive a linear response Kubo formula for the kinetic magnetoelectric effect projected to individual branches of a two branch system. This allows us, in particular, to identify a source of this effect that stems from noncommutation of the position and $\partial/\partial\boldsymbol B$ operators' components. This is an analog of the contribution to the Hall conductivity from noncommuting components of the position operator. We comment on the relation between such contributions and the Berry curvature theory. We also report several additional observations related to the electron magnetic moment operator in systems with SOC and other relativistic corrections.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.10956v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Weyl Magnons in the Non-Coplanar Antiferromagnet MnTe$_2$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18534</link><description>arXiv:2512.18534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a combination of band representation analysis, inelastic neutron scattering (INS), magneto-Raman spectroscopy measurements, and linear spin wave theory, we establish that the non-coplanar antiferromagnet MnTe$_2$ is a tunable Weyl magnon material, hosting symmetry-protected topological nodal lines in its magnon band structure, protected by the the non-coplanar nature of the antiferromagnetic ordering, that transition into Weyl magnons upon the application of symmetry-breaking perturbations using an external magnetic field. By constructing a spin model that reproduces the observed INS magnon spectra and field-dependence of the Raman $\Gamma$-magnons, we directly probe the topological magnon nodal lines and observe their associated signature of non-trivial topology through the pseudo-spin winding of the scattering intensity in angular scans near the nodal lines. Finally, we discuss how to induce Weyl magnons in the spectrum through an external magnetic field, shedding light on future in-field INS and thermal Hall experiments. This work establishes a clear magnonic analog to Weyl electrons, enabling further exploration of topological behavior in bosonic systems and highlighting the interplay between magnetic order and band topology in non-coplanar antiferromagnets.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.18534v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Thermodynamic assessment of the Ba-La-S and Ga-La-S systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11899</link><description>arXiv:2601.11899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the first thermodynamic assessment of binary and pseudo-binary phase diagrams in the Ba--La--S and Ga--La--S systems by means of the CALPHAD method. Experimental phase diagram equilibrium data and thermodynamic properties available from the literature were critically reviewed and assessed using thermodynamic models for the Gibbs energies of individual phases. The associated solution model was used to describe the short-range ordering behavior of the liquid phases. To supplement the limited experimental data reported in the literature, ab initio molecular dynamics calculations were employed to derive mixing enthalpies of the liquid phases in the binary subsystems. The resulting phase diagrams and calculated thermodynamic properties show good agreement with available literature within the investigated compositional ranges of binary and pseudo-binary systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11899v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Advancing Universal Deep Learning for Electronic-Structure Hamiltonian Prediction of Materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19877</link><description>arXiv:2509.19877v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has offered significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT methods, yet the diversity of atomic types, structural patterns, and the high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians pose substantial challenges to the generalization performance. In this work, we contribute on both the methodology and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC, comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.19877v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Refined half-integer condition on RG flows</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12085</link><description>arXiv:2602.12085v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Renormalization group flows are constrained by symmetries. Traditionally, we have made the most of 't Hooft anomalies associated to the symmetries. The anomaly is mathematically part of the data for the monoidal structure on symmetry categories. The symmetry categories sometimes admit additional structures such as braiding. It was found that the additional structures give further constraints on renormalization group flows. One of these constraints is the half-integer condition. The condition claims the following. Braidings are characterized by conformal dimensions. A symmetry object $c$ in a braided symmetry category surviving all along the flow thus has two conformal dimensions, one in ultraviolet $h_c^\text{UV}$ and the other in infrared $h_c^\text{IR}$. In a renormalization group flow with a renormalization group defect, they add up to a half-integer $h_c^\text{UV}+h_c^\text{IR}\in\frac12\mathbb Z$. We find a necessary condition for the sum to be half-integer. We solve some flows with the refined half-integer condition.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12085v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Low-Cost IoT-Enabled Tele-ECG Monitoring for Resource-Constrained Settings: System Design and Prototype</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17114</link><description>arXiv:2602.17114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the availability of automation machinery and its superiority, are being slothful and inviting many diseases to invade them. The world still has so many places where people lack basic health facilities. Due to early detection and intervention, CDV can be cured to an extreme extent. It heavily reduces travel and associated costs. A remote ECG monitoring system enables community health workers to support and empower patients through telemedicine. However, there remains some financial and logistical burden. Heart disease cannot be taken lightly. These patients require regular health check-ups and the attention of health personnel in a short period if their health deteriorates suddenly and rapidly. Chronic diseases are extremely variable in their symptoms and evolution of treatment. Some, if not treated early, will end the patient's life. The trend of the INTERNET OF THINGS, IoT, is spreading massively. This paper focuses on the three main: the operator, the doctor, and the server over which the data is being sent.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.17114v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] A Data-Driven Dynamic Execution Orchestration Architecture</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17119</link><description>arXiv:2602.17119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain-specific accelerators deliver exceptional performance on their target workloads through fabrication-time orchestrated datapaths. However, such specialized architectures often exhibit performance fragility when exposed to new kernels or irregular input patterns. In contrast, programmable architectures like FPGAs, CGRAs, and GPUs rely on compile-time orchestration to support a broader range of applications; but they are typically less efficient under irregular or sparse data. Pushing the boundaries of programmable architectures requires designs that can achieve efficiency and high-performance on par with specialized accelerators while retaining the agility of general-purpose architectures.
  We introduce Canon, a parallel architecture that bridges the gap between specialized and general purpose architectures. Canon exploits data-level and instruction-level parallelism through its novel design. First, it employs a novel dynamic data-driven orchestration mechanism using programmable Finite State Machines (FSMs). These FSMs are programmed at compile time to encode high-level dataflow per state and translate incoming meta-information (e.g., sparse coordinates) into control instructions at runtime. Second, Canon introduces a time-lapsed SIMD execution in which instructions are issued across a row of processing elements over several cycles, creating a staggered pipelined execution. These innovations amortize control overhead, allowing dynamic instruction changes while constructing a continuously evolving dataflow that maximizes parallelism. Experimental evaluation shows that Canon delivers high performance across diverse data-agnostic and data-driven kernels while achieving efficiency comparable to specialized accelerators, yet retaining the flexibility of a general-purpose architecture.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.17119v1</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Social status and the relationship between income rank and well-being in 109 nations</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69729-x</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 20 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69729-x"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-69729-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Higher incomes are associated with higher well-being.

Despite artificial intelligence (AI) providing opportunities while also posing risks, empirical evidence of its impact on urban resilience remains limited. Using panel data from 266 prefecture-level cities in China for the period between 2011 and 2022, this study examined the impact of AI development on urban resilience and elucidated the underlying mechanisms based on the technology–organization–environment framework.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00458-X?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Adaptation-dependent modulation of coordinated muscle activities in human gait adaptation as revealed by tensor decomposition</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00407-4?rss=yes</link><description>Extensive research has explored muscle synergies as a strategy for managing motor redundancy and motor adaptation as a process for adjusting to novel environments. However, the relationship between these two fundamental concepts remains unclear. To address this gap, we analyzed muscle activity during split-belt treadmill walking adaptation using tensor decomposition. Our results reveal that two specific synergies—one associated with the fast limb and the other with the slow limb—are strongly recruited at the onset of adaptation and decline over time.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid

Here, the authors take a microscopic look at Andreev reflection by reducing the interface down to a single molecule. Intriguingly, they find that the Andreev interconversion process is altered at the intramolecular length scale, which the authors associate with the spatial orbital texture of the molecule. These results may become relevant for miniaturized low-dissipation circuitry in future computer architectures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height="" src="https://cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/PRB/key_images/10.1103/lybh-5fn2.png" width="200" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Phys.

Abstract: In one-dimensional systems, spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) states are fragile by nature, as the injection of a non-zero energy density above the ground state is expected to restore the symmetry. This instability implies that local perturbations can lead to macroscopic correlation profiles, a breaking of clustering properties and even macroscopic quantum superpositions. In this work, we investigate the effect of interaction on this phenomenology by considering an interacting model with conserved domain wall number, that possesses a ferromagnetic ground state breaking the Z2 symmetry of the Hamiltonian. We first show that a local quench in this system amplifies quantum interferences, producing a macroscopic magnetisation profile that directly reflects the scattering phase of the model. Then, we use two asymmetry measures, namely the Entanglement Asymmetry (EA) and Quantum Fisher Information (QFI), to characterise the quantum coherence associated with the fluctuations of the magnetisation. By focusing on subsystems comparable in size to the light-cone of the perturbation, we confirm the emergence of macroscopic quantum coherence throughout the whole perturbed region. Finally, we discuss the link between EA and QFI and show that the variance/EA inequality for pure state can be generalised to a QFI/EA inequality for mixed states.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.15969v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Transition between one- and two-dimensional topology in a Chern insulator of finite width</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16411</link><description>arXiv:2602.16411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology in quantum systems is typically considered in infinite crystals in one, two, or higher integer dimensions. Here, we show that one can continuously transform a system between a topological phase associated with one dimension and a topological phase associated with two dimensions without closing the energy gap. In this process, the dimension of the system itself changes. Concretely, we investigate a modified version of the Qi-Wu-Zhang model and develop a procedure to smoothly shrink the width of the system in one direction. By tracking gaps which remain open throughout the modulation, we establish a smooth transition from a two-dimensional to a one-dimensional topological insulator. In between the system exhibits both one- and two-dimensional topology, and the way the system accomplishes the transition is by making the one-dimensional topology more robust as the width decreases, while the two-dimensional topology becomes less robust. Finally, we show how the gaps arise from hybridization of edge states due to the finite width.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.16411v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Exceptional horns in $n$-root graphene and Lieb photonic ring lattices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16670</link><description>arXiv:2602.16670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic construction of non-Hermitian tight-binding lattices whose Bloch spectra are $n$th roots of those of Hermitian parent two-dimensional (2D) lattices, namely graphene and the Lieb lattice. The $n$-roots of these models are constructed from connecting loop modules of unidirectional couplings whose geometrical arrangements match that of the corresponding parent system. Their energy spectrum is shown to consist of $n$ rotated and equivalent branches in the complex energy plane, each matching the real spectrum of the parent model when raised to the $n$th power, together with extra zero-energy flat bands (FBs) accounted for by the generalized index theorem. We show how the low-energy Dirac cones of the parent models translate, for an appropriate choice of phase configuration for the couplings of the $n$-root lattices, as what we call an "exceptional horn" appearing at each branch, with the central Dirac point (DP) converted into zero-energy exceptional points (EPs) of order $n$ or higher at high-symmetry momenta. These exceptional horns reflect the behavior of low-lying excitations that scale with momentum as $E\sim\vert \mathbf{q}\vert^{\frac{1}{n}}$, with $n\geq 3$, as opposed to the linear massless modes that characterize a Dirac cone. Moreover, we derive analytic expressions for the associated Landau levels (LLs), whose energies scale with magnetic flux as $E\sim\phi^{\frac{1}{2n}}$. For the case of the $n$-root Lieb lattice, the zeroth LL is shown to be exceptional. These results are analytically derived for both $n$-root models and numerically demonstrated for certain values of $n$. Finally, we propose a realistic photonic implementation based on coupled ring resonators with a split configuration of optical gain and loss.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.16670v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] $p$-wave magnet driven field-free Josephson diode effect</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16677</link><description>arXiv:2602.16677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the superconducting diode effect (SDE), characterized by unequal critical currents in opposite directions, has been observed experimentally and predicted theoretically in models of bulk superconductors and Josephson junctions (JJs). In this work, we construct a Josephson junction using a recently discovered unconventional coplanar magnet, the $p$-wave magnet (PM), with proximity-induced superconductivity, and demonstrate the emergence of a Josephson diode effect (JDE). The barrier region is formed by another unconventional collinear magnet, namely an altermagnet (AM). We illustrate that apart from time-reversal and inversion symmetries, the mirror operation $M_{yz}$ emerges as the key symmetry constraint. Also, unlike earlier models that realize the JDE using unconventional magnets, this setup does not require Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) or different superconductors across the junction. Moreover, we demonstrate that the realization of the JDE in this framework requires only minimal conditions while maintaining high performance. The effect remains robust across a broad parameter regime, and thus making the system particularly promising for applications in quantum circuits and computing technologies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.16677v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Graphical model for factorization and completion of relatively high rank tensors by sparse sampling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17886</link><description>arXiv:2510.17886v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider tensor factorizations based on sparse measurements of the components of relatively high rank tensors. The measurements are designed in a way that the underlying graph of interactions is a random graph. The setup will be useful in cases where a substantial amount of data is missing, as in completion of relatively high rank matrices for recommendation systems heavily used in social network services. In order to obtain theoretical insights on the setup, we consider statistical inference of the tensor factorization in a high dimensional limit, which we call as dense limit, where the graphs are large and dense but not fully connected. We build message-passing algorithms and test them in a Bayes optimal teacher-student setting in some specific cases. We also develop a replica theory to examine the performance of statistical inference in the dense limit based on a cumulant expansion. The latter approach allows one to avoid blind usage of Gaussian ansatz which fails in some fully connected systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.17886v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Bit-Width-Aware Design Environment for Few-Shot Learning on Edge AI Hardware</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16024</link><description>arXiv:2602.16024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose an implementation methodology of real-time few-shot learning on tiny FPGA SoCs such as the PYNQ-Z1 board with arbitrary fixed-point bit-widths. Tensil-based conventional design environments limited hardware implementations to fixed-point bit-widths of 16 or 32 bits. To address this, we adopt the FINN framework, enabling implementations with arbitrary bit-widths. Several customizations and minor adjustments are made, including: 1.Optimization of Transpose nodes to resolve data format mismatches, 2.Addition of handling for converting the final reduce mean operation to Global Average Pooling (GAP). These adjustments allow us to reduce the bit-width while maintaining the same accuracy as the conventional realization, and achieve approximately twice the throughput in evaluations using CIFAR-10 dataset.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.16024v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Energy-Efficient p-Bit-Based Fully-Connected Quantum-Inspired Simulated Annealer with Dual BRAM Architecture</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16143</link><description>arXiv:2602.16143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic bits (p-bits) offer an energy-efficient hardware abstraction for stochastic optimization; however, existing p-bit-based simulated annealing accelerators suffer from poor scalability and limited support for fully connected graphs due to fan-out and memory overhead. This paper presents an energy-efficient FPGA architecture for stochastic simulated quantum annealing (SSQA) that addresses these challenges. The proposed design combines a spin-serial and replica-parallel update schedule with a dual-BRAM delay-line architecture, enabling scalable support for fully connected Ising models while eliminating fan-out growth in logic resources. By exploiting SSQA, the architecture achieves fast convergence using only final replica states, significantly reducing memory requirements compared to conventional p-bit-based annealers. Implemented on a Xilinx ZC706 FPGA, the proposed system solves an 800-node MAX-CUT benchmark and achieves up to 50% reduction in energy consumption and over 90\% reduction in logic resources compared with prior FPGA-based p-bit annealing architectures. These results demonstrate the practicality of quantum-inspired, p-bit-based annealing hardware for large-scale combinatorial optimization under strict energy and resource constraints.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.16143v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] KANEL\'E: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Efficient LUT-based Evaluation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12850</link><description>arXiv:2512.12850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-latency, resource-efficient neural network inference on FPGAs is essential for applications demanding real-time capability and low power. Lookup table (LUT)-based neural networks are a common solution, combining strong representational power with efficient FPGA implementation. In this work, we introduce KANEL\'E, a framework that exploits the unique properties of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for FPGA deployment. Unlike traditional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), KANs employ learnable one-dimensional splines with fixed domains as edge activations, a structure naturally suited to discretization and efficient LUT mapping. We present the first systematic design flow for implementing KANs on FPGAs, co-optimizing training with quantization and pruning to enable compact, high-throughput, and low-latency KAN architectures. Our results demonstrate up to a 2700x speedup and orders of magnitude resource savings compared to prior KAN-on-FPGA approaches. Moreover, KANEL\'E matches or surpasses other LUT-based architectures on widely used benchmarks, particularly for tasks involving symbolic or physical formulas, while balancing resource usage across FPGA hardware. Finally, we showcase the versatility of the framework by extending it to real-time, power-efficient control systems.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.12850v2</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] PAN2 maintains mRNA poly(A) tail homeostasis and regulates translation during spermiogenesis in mice</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69639-y</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 19 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69639-y"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-69639-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;PAN2-PAN3 complexes trim poly(A) tails of mRNAs.

Traditional estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) is commonly used to manage estrogen deficiency related conditions, such as vulvovaginal atrophy during menopause, but its systemic effects pose notable risks. This study introduces OptoER, an optogenetic tool engineered to precisely modulate ER-mediated genomic pathways through light-induced transcription regulation, offering spatial-temporal control over ER-dependent gene expression.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00480-3?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Experience-dependent modulation of prosocial touch in mice</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00477-3?rss=yes</link><description>Prosocial behaviors that benefit others are vital for social cohesion and collective well-being. How prior experiences shape future prosocial actions remains a critical open question. Mice can respond to distressed social partners with prosocial touch (allogrooming), alleviating stress in recipients. We show that mice that previously received prosocial contact following stress subsequently exhibited enhanced allogrooming toward stressed partners, and the amount of allogrooming previously received predicted the amount later displayed toward others.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid

Abstract: We study the effects of uncorrelated quenched disorder to the phase diagram and continuous transitions of three-dimensional lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge Higgs models. For this purpose, we consider two types of quenched disorder, associated with the sites and plaquettes of the cubic lattice. In both cases, for sufficiently weak disorder, the phase diagram remains similar to that of the pure system, showing two different phases (one of them being a topologically ordered phase), separated by two different continuous transition lines. However, the quenched disorder changes the universality classes of the critical behaviors along some of the transition lines. The random-plaquette disorder turns out to be relevant along the topological ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge transition line, so the critical behaviors belong to the different random-plaquette $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge (RP${\mathbb Z}_2$G) universality class with length-scale exponent $\nu=\nu_{\rm rp}\approx 0.82$; on the other hand, it turns out to be irrelevant along the other Ising$^\times$ transition line (a variant of the Ising transitions with a gauge-dependent order parameter), leaving unchanged its asymptotic critical behaviors with $\nu=\nu_{\cal I}\approx 0.63$. The random-site disorder leads to a substantially different scenario: it destabilizes the Ising$^\times$ critical behaviors of the pure model, changing them into those of the randomly-dilute Ising$^{\times}$ (RDI$^{\times}$) universality class with $\nu=\nu_{\rm rdi}\approx 0.68$, while the critical behaviors along the other ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge topological transition line remains stable, with $\nu=\nu_{\cal I}\approx 0.63$.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.15418v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Temperature-dependent photoionization thresholds of alkali-metal nanoparticles reveal thermal expansion and the melting transition</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15434</link><description>arXiv:2602.15434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A precision measurement of the photoionization of pure sodium and potassium nanoparticles isolated in a beam enabled an accurate determination of their work functions as a function of temperature. In addition to resolving and quantifying the initial gradual decrease of the work function with temperature, which is associated with thermal expansion, the experiment revealed that the work function then undergoes a distinct drop both in magnitude and in slope that signifies the onset of nanoparticle melting. This establishes that a structural phase transition can be detected via a high-resolution measurement of the photoemission threshold. The melting temperature of nanoparticles with diameters of 7-9 nm is reduced by nearly 100 K relative to the bulk value. This suppression aligns with predictions from the Gibbs-Thomson equation which describes finite-size phase transitions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.15434v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Ambipolar doping-induced surface in-gap state on Mott-insulating Ca$_2$RuO$_4$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15610</link><description>arXiv:2602.15610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an x-ray photoemission spectroscopy study of Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ surface-dosed with Cs alkali atoms and C$_{60}$ molecules. Due to its small ionization energy (large electron affinity), deposited Cs atoms (C$_{60}$ molecules) are expected to provide a solid surface with electrons (holes). Upon dosing the dopants to Mott-insulating Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, we found a new Ru $3d$ photoemission peak emerging on the lower binding-energy side, suggesting the creation of a core-hole screening channel associated with coherent Ru $4d$ states around the Fermi level. For both the Cs and C$_{60}$ dosing, this change occurred without an appreciable chemical potential jump. The coherent state, therefore, develops within the Mott gap through hybridization with the impurity level of the dopants. The present work highlights the flexibility of Mott-insulator surfaces as a playground for metal-insulator transitions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.15610v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Revealing 3D Strain and Carbide Architectures in Additively Manufactured Ni Superalloys</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15729</link><description>arXiv:2602.15729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast directional solidification during Laser Additive Manufacturing (LAM) produces a complex microstructure in nickel-based superalloys, comprising columnar grains with cellular sub-grain structures and carbides. Using non-destructive Scanning 3D X-ray Diffraction (S3DXRD), we reveal spatially complex orientation and intergranular strain relationships that couple strongly to processing-induced cellular sub-grain networks and a primary cubic metal carbide (MC) phase. We have examined 3D orientation and elastic strain tensor fields across 82 $\gamma$ grains together with the spatial distribution of over 37,000 MC carbides in an ABD-900AM alloy sample manufactured by the Directed Energy Deposition (DED) LAM process. Carbides are spatially associated with the cellular sub-grain network with a weak but present orientation relationship with their parent $\gamma$ grains. The MC carbides, known to be Ti, Ta and Nb rich, form in regions of high solute segregation, resulting in a significant volumetric lattice parameter patterning in the associated $\gamma$ phase regions. These chemically distinct solute-rich regions possess a higher associated elastic modulus compared to intercellular regions and determine the local residual stress patterning. These results provide the first non-destructive 3D study of the relationship between rapid solidification-induced segregation, deformation heterogeneity and carbide architectures in an additively manufactured Ni-based superalloy. The insights provide crucial detail to rationalise LAM process parameter optimisation and the coupled spatially governed structural performance.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.15729v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Full-Field Damage Monitoring in Architected Lattices Using In situ Electrical Impedance Tomography</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15048</link><description>arXiv:2602.15048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) enables non-invasive, spatially continuous reconstruction of internal conductivity distributions, providing full field sensing beyond conventional point measurements. Here, we report the first in situ implementation of EIT within a tunable architected lattice materials framework, enabling systematic exploration across a broad lattice design space while achieving real time monitoring of damage evolution, including early stage, prefracture events, in 3D printed multifunctional lattice composites. Lattices are designed via Voronoi based branch trunk branch motifs inspired by 2D wallpaper symmetries and fabricated using CNT infused photocurable resins, with nanoscale filler dispersion confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscopy. Sixteen electrodes distributed along the lattice periphery enable EIT measurements during quasi static tensile loading. Conductivity maps reconstructed using adjacent and across current injection schemes resolve sequential ligament fracture with high temporal resolution, with localised conductivity loss quantitatively coinciding with fracture sites, including regions remote from electrodes. Architectural tunability allows systematic control of EIT imaging sensitivity to early stage damage, while pronounced resistance discontinuities at failure further corroborate spatial localisation; global end to end resistance measurements complement macroscopic stress strain responses. Collectively, these results establish in situ EIT as a scalable, full field sensing modality for architected multifunctional materials, providing an experimentally validated pathway toward autonomous, intelligent materials and data rich material states that can inform digital twin frameworks for structural, biomedical, and energy related applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.15048v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Exact Solutions to Matrix Models and String Theories: The Local Construction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15101</link><description>arXiv:2602.15101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exact nonperturbative solutions to hermitian one-matrix models, their topological string duals, as well as their double-scaling limits to multicritical and minimal string theories, may be obtained via the use of resurgent transseries. These solutions are generically resonant, entailing both eigenvalues and anti-eigenvalues, or, equivalently, both D-branes and negative-tension D-branes -- but are otherwise intricate to write down, having been previously addressed on a case-by-case approach. This work shows how there is a general and rather compact way to write down all these exact and fully nonperturbative transseries solutions in closed-form, immediately starting from the spectral geometry of the matrix model or string theory at hand, in the form of a discrete Fourier or Zak transform for their partition functions. This structure is inherently associated to the existence of anti-eigenvalues or negative-tension D-branes. The validity of these solutions is testable across all values of the parameters -- from weak to strong 't Hooft coupling, from small to large N; equivalently, from semi-classical to deeply quantum regimes -- and many such nonperturbative tests are performed against diverse examples ranging from matrix models to non-critical strings, fully validating our analytical and exact expressions. In particular, anti-eigenvalues or negative-tension D-branes are absolutely required to find sharp numerical matches. In order to study these solutions globally across their phase diagrams, however, complete non-linear Stokes data is still needed -- which will be addressed in a complementary follow-up paper.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.15101v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Generalized GMP Algebra for Three-Dimensional Quantum Hall Fluids of Extended Objects</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15664</link><description>arXiv:2602.15664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a geometric framework for three-dimensional quantum Hall fluids of extended objects (quasi-strings) in the presence of a strong three-form background field associated with a bundle gerbe. In the strong-field regime, fast internal dynamics is frozen and the low-energy kinematics is governed by generalized guiding-center variables consisting of vectorial and tensorial coordinates. We show that these guiding-center variables obey a noncommutative geometry giving rise to a three-dimensional generalization of the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman (GMP) algebra for projected density operators. Moreover, we relate this algebra to the canonical quantization of a topological BF+BB theory whose level is identified with the Dixmier-Douady invariant. Our results clarify the structure of incompressible quantum Hall-type phases and their geometric and topological features in three spatial dimensions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.15664v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Temperley-Lieb modules and local operators for critical ADE models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15742</link><description>arXiv:2602.15742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate critical restricted solid-on-solid models associated to Dynkin diagrams of type $A$, $D$ and $E$, with fixed, periodic and twisted periodic boundary conditions. These models are endowed with an action of the diagrams of the Temperley-Lieb category. For each model, we obtain the decomposition of the state space as a direct sum of irreducible modules over the Temperley-Lieb algebra $\mathsf{TL}_N(\beta)$ or its periodic incarnation $\mathsf{\mathcal EPTL}_N(\beta)$. This allows us to recover the known conformal partition functions for these models in the continuum scaling limit.
  For each irreducible factor arising in the decompositions, we define an associated local operator on the lattice, which behaves like a connectivity operator. Using knowledge from the Temperley-Lieb representation theory at roots of unity, we show that these operators satisfy certain linear difference relations, which are lattice counterparts of the singular-vector relations in conformal field theory.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.15742v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Electropolishing-Induced Topographic Defects in Niobium: Insights and Implications for Superconducting Radio Frequency Applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25423</link><description>arXiv:2509.25423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electropolishing is the premier surface preparation method for high-Q, high-gradient superconducting RF cavities made of Nb. This leaves behind an apparently smooth surface, yet the achievable peak magnetic fields fall well below the superheating field of Nb, in most cases. In this work, the ultimate surface finish of electropolishing was investigated by studying its effect on highly polished Nb samples. Electropolishing introduces high slope angle sloped-steps at grain boundaries. The magnetic field enhancement and superheating field suppression factors associated with such a geometry are calculated in the London theory. Despite the by-eye smoothness of electropolished Nb, such defects compromise the stability of the low-loss Meissner state, likely limiting the achievable peak accelerating fields in superconducting RF cavities. Finally, the impact of surface roughness on impurity diffusion is investigated which can link surface roughness to the effectiveness of heat treatments like low-temperature baking or nitrogen infusion in the vortex nucleation or hydride hypotheses. Surface roughness tends to decrease the effective dose of impurities as a result of the expansion of impurities into regions with greater internal angle. The effective dose of impurities can be protected by minimizing slope angles and step heights, ensuring uniformity.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.25423v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Field-induced states and thermodynamics of the frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14380</link><description>arXiv:2601.14380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state and finite-temperature properties of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice in the presence of an external magnetic field. We focus on the highly frustrated regime around $J_2 \approx J_1/2$. The $h$-$T$ phase diagram is investigated with particular emphasis on the finite-temperature transition into the "up-up-up-down" state that is stabilized by thermal and quantum fluctuations and manifests itself as a plateau at one half of the saturation magnetization in the quantum case. We also discuss the enhanced magnetocaloric effect associated to the ground-state degeneracy that arises at the saturation field for $J_2=J_1/2$. For reference, we first study the classical case by classical Monte Carlo simulations. Then we turn to the extreme quantum limit of spin-1/2 where we perform zero- and finite-temperature Lanczos calculations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14380v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interplay between non-Fermi liquid and non-Hermiticity: A multi-method study of non-Hermitian multichannel Kondo model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13749</link><description>arXiv:2602.13749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian multichannel Kondo problems host both non-Fermi liquid and non-Hermitian physics, which provide a prototypical model to explore exotic collective quantum phenomena driven by the two different ingredients. Here, we first propose an experimental setup that realizes this model with exact channel symmetry as well as a controllable PT symmetry. Then, we perform a multi-method study of this model, focusing on the low-energy spectrum, the thermodynamic quantities, and the transport properties associated with different fixed points. Using the Bethe ansatz approach, we identify existence of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov-like state previously found in the non-Hermitian single-channel Kondo model. Then, based on non-Hermitian numerical renormalization group calculations, we reveal clear numerical signatures of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov state emerging in the relatively strong non-Hermiticity regime of the PT-asymmetric model. Furthermore, our boundary conformal field theory, which is found to be applicable for the PT-symmetric model, uncovers an anomalous temperature dependence of the Kondo conductance, which is beyond conventional Hermitian Kondo systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.13749v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Self-similar inverse cascade from generalized symmetries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07781</link><description>arXiv:2501.07781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of generalized symmetries in driving non-equilibrium and non-linear phenomena, specifically focusing on turbulent systems. While conventional turbulence studies have revealed inverse cascades driven by conserved quantities integrated over the entire space, such as helicity in three spatial dimensions, the influence of higher-form symmetries, whose conserved charges are defined by integration over subspaces, remains largely unexplored. We demonstrate a novel mechanism where higher-form symmetries naturally induce a self-similar inverse cascade. Taking axion electrodynamics with non-linear topological interaction as a paradigmatic example, we show that the conserved charge associated with its 1-form symmetry drives the system toward large-scale coherent structures through a universal scaling behavior characterized by analytically determined scaling exponents. Our findings suggest that higher-form symmetries can provide a fundamental organizing principle for understanding non-equilibrium phenomena and the emergence of coherent structures in turbulent systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.07781v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] On the principal eigenvectors of random Markov matrices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01608</link><description>arXiv:2505.01608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the invariant distributions of continuous-time and discrete-time random walks on randomly weighted complete digraphs. These distributions correspond to the principal left eigenvectors of the associated random Markov generators and kernels, viewed as random matrices. While much is known about the spectra of these matrices, relatively little is known about the principal left eigenvectors, which are delicate random objects for which no explicit form is known. We consider a broad class of such matrices obtained by associating random weights to the vertices and edges of the complete digraph. Our main result concerns the total variation distance between the invariant distribution of the continuous-time random walk and the distribution that is inversely proportional to the vertex weights. It states that, if the edge weights are i.i.d. with a finite $p$-th moment for some $p&gt;4$, then this distance a.s. converges to zero as the number of vertices grows large, even when the vertex weights are heavy-tailed. We further answer a question of Bordenave, Caputo, and Chafa\"i by showing that, despite the dependence of the entries in the corresponding Markov kernel, its invariant distribution is asymptotically uniform a.s., so long as the edge weights have a finite second moment.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.01608v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Fundamentals of Trapped Ions and Quantum Simulation of Chemical Dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20412</link><description>arXiv:2505.20412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trapped atomic ions are among the most advanced platforms for quantum simulation, computation, and metrology, offering long coherence times and precise, individual control over both internal and motional degrees of freedom. In this review, we present a pedagogical introduction to trapped-ion systems, covering the physics of ion trapping, qubit encodings, and laser-ion interactions. We explain how spin-dependent forces generated by light fields enable both analog and digital quantum simulations of spin and spin-boson models, as well as high-fidelity quantum logic gates. We then highlight an emerging frontier in the simulation of chemical dynamics, summarizing recent experiments that demonstrate the capability of trapped ions to simulate vibronic models and excitation-transfer processes. Finally, we outline future directions in quantum simulation and discuss open challenges in scaling up trapped-ion architectures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.20412v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Graphical model for factorization and completion of relatively high rank tensors by sparse sampling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17886</link><description>arXiv:2510.17886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider tensor factorizations based on sparse measurements of the components of relatively high rank tensors. The measurements are designed in a way that the underlying graph of interactions is a random graph. The setup will be useful in cases where a substantial amount of data is missing, as in completion of relatively high rank matrices for recommendation systems heavily used in social network services. In order to obtain theoretical insights on the setup, we consider statistical inference of the tensor factorization in a high dimensional limit, which we call as dense limit, where the graphs are large and dense but not fully connected. We build message-passing algorithms and test them in a Bayes optimal teacher-student setting in some specific cases. We also develop a replica theory to examine the performance of statistical inference in the dense limit based on a cumulant expansion.

Simplicial and cell complexes are ideal higher-order network representations for investigating higher-order topological dynamics where dynamical variables are not only associated with nodes, but also with edges, triangles, and higher-order simplices and cells. Global Topological Synchronization (GTS) refers to the dynamical state in which identical oscillators associated with higher-dimensional simplices and cells oscillate in unison. On standard unweighted and undirected complexes this dynamical state can be achieved only under strict topological and combinatorial conditions on the underlying discrete support. In this work we consider generalized higher-order network representations including directed and hollow complexes. Based on an in depth investigation of their topology defined by their associated algebraic topology operators and Betti numbers, we determine under which conditions GTS can be observed. We show that directed complexes always admit a global topological synchronization state independently of their topology and structure. However, we demonstrate that for directed complexes this dynamical state cannot be asymptotically stable. While hollow complexes require more stringent topological conditions to sustain global topological synchronization, these topologies can favor both the existence and the stability of global topological synchronization with respect to undirected and unweighted complexes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09715v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Refined half-integer condition on RG flows</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12085</link><description>arXiv:2602.12085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Renormalization group flows are constrained by symmetries. Traditionally, we have made the most of 't Hooft anomalies associated to the symmetries. The anomaly is mathematically part of the data for the monoidal structure on symmetry categories. The symmetry categories sometimes admit additional structures such as braiding. It was found that the additional structures give further constraints on renormalization group flows. One of these constraints is the half-integer condition. The condition claims the following. Braidings are characterized by conformal dimensions. A symmetry object $c$ in a braided symmetry category surviving all along the flow thus has two conformal dimensions, one in ultraviolet $h_c^\text{UV}$ and the other in infrared $h_c^\text{IR}$. In a renormalization group flow with a renormalization group defect, they add up to a half-integer $h_c^\text{UV}+h_c^\text{IR}\in\frac12\mathbb Z$. We find a necessary condition for the sum to be half-integer. We solve some flows with the refined half-integer condition.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12085v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Deconfinement from Thermal Tensor Networks: Universal CFT signature in (2+1)-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13124</link><description>arXiv:2602.13124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks offer a sign-problem-free approach to study lattice gauge theories, but extracting precise universal information associated with the deconfinement transition remains challenging. In this work, we study the deconfinement transition of (2+1)-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories at finite temperature using a thermal tensor network approach, where the partition functions at finite temperature are formulated as three-dimensional tensor networks. These tensor networks are first contracted in the temporal direction, and the subsequent coarse-graining in the spatial directions yields a renormalized transfer matrix, the spectrum of which directly encodes the universal conformal field theory data. In particular, by numerically extracting the central charge and scaling dimensions, we verify that the universality class of the thermal deconfinement transition matches the prediction of the Svetitsky-Yaffe conjecture for $N=2,3,5$. Moreover, we show that the $\mathbb{Z}_5$ theory at finite temperature exhibits an intermediate phase with an emergent U(1) symmetry. Critical couplings are determined via Gu-Wen ratios and agree with existing Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, extrapolating these critical couplings at finite temperature enables us to determine the deconfinement transition points for $N=2,3$ at zero temperature.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.13124v2</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Food Additive Lens: An on-device AI application for real-time science-based consumer education on food additives using retrieval-augmented generation</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00444F</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, Accepted Manuscript&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00444F, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY-NC.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;YIHANG FENG, Yi Wang, Xinhao Wang, Bo  Zhao, Jinbo Bi, Song  Han, Yangchao Luo&lt;br /&gt;Consumer concerns about food additives have intensified amid widespread misinformation, with the 2024 IFIC survey revealing that 35% of consumers actively avoid artificial ingredients despite authoritative safety data existing in...&lt;br /&gt;The content of this RSS Feed (c) The Royal Society of Chemistry&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00444F</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Previous studies have suggested that liquid-like cation motion associated with fast ionic transport can disrupt crystalline symmetry, thereby lifting Raman selection rules. Here, we exploit the resulting low-frequency, diffusive Raman scattering as a spectral signature of fast ionic conduction and develop a machine learning (ML)-accelerated computational pipeline to identify promising solid electrolytes based on this feature. By overcoming the steep computational barriers to calculating Raman spectra of strongly disordered materials at finite temperatures, we achieve near-ab initio accuracy and demonstrate the predictive power of our approach for sodium-ion conductors, revealing clear Raman signatures of liquid-like ion conduction. This work highlights how ML can bridge atomistic simulations and experimental observables, enabling data-efficient discovery of fast-ion conductors.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae411a</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Here, we show that a single sulfonium capping layer of dimethyl(phenethyl)sulfonium iodide (DMPESI) simultaneously mitigates both loss pathways, enabling stable operation from bright (1000 lux) to ultra-dim (50 lux) white light-emitting diode illumination. DMPESI-passivated indoor photovoltaic cells exhibit a stabilized power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 31.8% and an open-circuit voltage (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;VOC&lt;/span&gt;) approaching 1 V at 1000 lux, sustain 27.5% PCE at 200 lux, and still deliver 21.9% PCE with &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;VOC&lt;/span&gt; ≈ 0.85 V at 50 lux. Across this range, the hysteresis index declines by ≈25%–40%. Transient photovoltage reveals ∼60% longer carrier lifetimes; impedance spectroscopy shows a ≈40% increase in recombination resistance, and capacitance–frequency spectra display a two- to threefold reduction in capacitance at 10 Hz, collectively confirming the simultaneous suppression of trap-assisted recombination and ion migration. An ultrathin sulfonium interlayer (DMPESI) enables stable, low-hysteresis indoor operation across 1000/200/50 lux (IEC TS 62607-7-2:2023). A combined SCLC–IS–KPFM analysis shows a reduction in trap density, suppressed low-frequency ionic response, and a higher perovskite surface work function consistent with enhanced hole extraction. A stabilized 31.8% PCE at 1000 lux is achieved for the 1.6 eV triple-cation CsMAFA-Pb. This approach paves the way for self-powered IoT devices with significantly reduced battery replacement needs, helping to ease the environmental burden of electronic waste.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/7/073304/3380394/Sulfonium-based-passivation-suppresses-trap</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Optoelectronic synaptic devices based on TMD alloys for image memory and processing</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/7/073305/3380392/Optoelectronic-synaptic-devices-based-on-TMD</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Optoelectronic synaptic devices emulate the parallel processing and low-power characteristics of biological neural systems, enabling real-time image processing and dynamic object tracking. These advancements address the limitations of conventional von Neumann architectures. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have become important candidate materials for synaptic devices due to their excellent optoelectronic properties, and the trapping effect of defects in TMDs on photogenerated carriers enables this possibility. However, current synaptic devices based on TMDs face the challenges associated with unstable defect effects, relying on complex heterojunctions and device structures to achieve neural synapse function, which limits their widespread application. In this work, the alloying strategy of TMDs is adopted to address this issue. The large-scale growth and composition gradient control of monolayer MoS&lt;sub&gt;2(1−x)&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;2x&lt;/sub&gt; are achieved under the guidance of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;ab initio&lt;/span&gt; molecular dynamics. Based on the defect effect in MoS&lt;sub&gt;2(1−x)&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;2x&lt;/sub&gt; through the synergistic effect of S atom vacancies and substitutions, synaptic devices with dual-terminal structure are constructed, which have photoresponsivity of 0.23 A/W and pair-pulse facilitation ratio of 147%. An imaging system is also built to demonstrate the imaging memory and processing functions of the devices. The defect effect engineered through alloying offers a promising pathway for the development of synaptic devices.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/7/073305/3380392/Optoelectronic-synaptic-devices-based-on-TMD</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Oral Microbiome Diversity Shapes the Association Between Leisure-Time Physical Activity and Cognitive Function Among Older Adults</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00461-X?rss=yes</link><description>Regular leisure-time physical activity and the composition of the oral microbiome may influence late-life cognition, but their combined effects are unclear. We studied 575 US adults aged 60–69 years from a nationally representative survey with oral microbiome sequencing, self-reported leisure-time physical activity, and four standard cognitive tests of memory, verbal fluency, and processing speed. Higher weekly physical activity and meeting current guideline levels were associated with better memory and processing speed scores after multivariable adjustment.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00461-X?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] CMV seropositivity associates with poor clinical outcome in triple negative breast cancer</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00456-6?rss=yes</link><description>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection modifies immune fitness and T-cell subset distribution in healthy donors. We analyzed a recent prospective cohort of 240 patients bearing triple negative breast cancer for CMV serology status and T-cell subsets and assessed recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). CMV seropositivity was significantly associated with worse RFS (HR=2.6, 95%CI=1.2–5.7) and OS (HR=3.0, 95%CI=1.2–7.4) in multivariable analyses. A prognostic model incorporating CMV status alongside tumor and nodal stage improved risk stratification.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00456-6?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] A fully differentiable pore network for digital reconstruction of porous media</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2026/DD/D5DD00455A</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/image/GA?id=D5DD00455A" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2026, Advance Article&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00455A, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Michael McKague, Mohammad Mehrnia, Mohammad Amin Sadeghi, Jeff Gostick&lt;br /&gt;This work highlights a fully differentiable framework for constructing pore networks from porosimetry and anisotropic permeability data.

Abstract: Metastability, i.e., partial relaxation to long-lived, quasi-stationary states before true asymptotic equilibrium sets in, emerges ubiquitously in classical and quantum dynamical systems as a result of timescales separation. In open quantum systems, an intrinsically nonequilibrium analogue, dynamical metastability, can originate from the spectral geometry of a non-Hermitian operator. In noninteracting models, this mechanism produces boundary-sensitive anomalous relaxation, transient amplification, and topologically mandated long-lived edge modes, all of which are enhanced as system size grows. Here we extend dynamical metastability into the nonlinear, interacting regime and identify magnetic heterostructures as a natural platform for its exploration. We introduce an interacting spin Lindbladian whose linearized magnon dynamics map onto a dynamically metastable Hatano-Nelson chain, and show that dynamical metastability in the noninteracting limit seeds genuinely nonlinear phenomena, including size-dependent spin dipping and anomalous attraction to unstable equilibria. Long-lived edge states associated to topologically mandated Dirac bosons persist under nonlinearities and disorder. We further analyze the magnetization dynamics in magnetic multilayers within the classical Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski framework, identifying Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, nonlocal damping, and spin-transfer torque as control parameters governing bulk-boundary stability mismatch and band topology. While all the distinctive dynamical phenomena previously identified reappear in this experimentally relevant setting, the LLGS framework also supports multistability and limit cycles that are absent in the quantum model. Our results constitute the first systematic study of dynamical metastability in nonlinear dynamics, directly relevant to spin-torque oscillator arrays, magnonic devices, and beyond.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.13390v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interplay between non-Fermi liquid and non-Hermiticity: A multi-method study of non-Hermitian multichannel Kondo model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13749</link><description>arXiv:2602.13749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian multichannel Kondo problems host both non-Fermi liquid and non-Hermitian physics, which provide a prototypical model to explore exotic collective quantum phenomena driven by the two different ingredients. Here, we first propose an experimental setup that realizes this model with exact channel symmetry as well as a controllable PT symmetry. Then, we perform a multi-method study of this model, focusing on the low-energy spectrum, the thermodynamic quantities, and the transport properties associated with different fixed points. Using the Bethe ansatz approach, we identify existence of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov-like state previously found in the non-Hermitian single-channel Kondo model. Then, based on non-Hermitian numerical renormalization group calculations, we reveal clear numerical signatures of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov state emerging in the relatively strong non-Hermiticity regime of the PT-asymmetric model. Furthermore, our boundary conformal field theory, which is found to be applicable for the PT-symmetric model, uncovers an anomalous temperature dependence of the Kondo conductance, which is beyond conventional Hermitian Kondo systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.13749v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Relativistic spin-momentum locking in ferromagnets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13768</link><description>arXiv:2602.13768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relativistic spin-momentum locking has been proven in time-reversal-breaking classes of materials with zero net magnetization in the non-relativistic limit, such as altermagnets and other non-collinear magnets. Using density functional theory calculations, we aim to show relativistic spin-momentum locking in ferromagnets, focusing on a broad class of ferromagnetic materials with magnetic sites connected by rotational symmetry, and compare with fcc Ni. In SrRuO3, the antisymmetric exchange interaction produces a spin canting orthogonal to the easy axis, while in all other cases, spin canting is forbidden. Even when the canted magnetic moment in real space is forbidden, relativistic spin-momentum locking shows sizable contributions in k-space. Using prototypical ferromagnets such as orthorhombic SrRuO3, hexagonal CrTe and CrAs with the NiAs crystal structure, half-Heusler MnPtSb, and fcc Ni, we demonstrate that relativistic spin-momentum locking can generate strong effects in ferromagnets. Subdominant components of centrosymmetric ferro-magnetic materials with magnetic sites connected by rotational symmetry host spin-momentum locking similar to altermagnets, while noncentrosymmetric MnPtSb hosts relativistic p-wave due to the spin-orbit coupling. Fcc Ni shows a more complex behavior with a combination of two spin-momentum locking patterns characteristic of altermagnets. Because ferromagnets typically have larger bandwidths than altermagnets, they provide a promising platform for observing even-wave relativistic spin-momentum locking and associated emergent phenomena. From an application standpoint, relativistic spin-momentum locking governs symmetry-allowed spin Hall currents, spin photocurrents, and other momentum-dependent spin responses in k-space.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.13768v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine Learning-integrated Multiscale Simulation Framework: Bridging Scales in Associative Polymer-Colloid Suspensions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13911</link><description>arXiv:2602.13911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the rheological behavior of associative polymers bridging colloidal particles into transient networks is fundamentally challenging because the coupled spatiotemporal scales prevent efficient molecular-fidelity modeling. We address this through a novel, unified multiscale simulation framework for telechelic polymer-colloid suspensions integrating: explicit-chain Brownian dynamics resolving polymer-particle association kinetics; active learning metamodels compressing kinetics into efficient surrogates; and Population Balance-Brownian Dynamics (Pop-BD) computing network-scale dynamics from metamodel predictions. Validated against explicit-chain Brownian dynamics, our framework accurately reproduces time-and frequency-dependent stress relaxation moduli, enabling simulations of larger systems over longer timescales. Systematic investigations reveal that network connectivity exhibits critical transitions at specific chain-to-particle ratios, with bond density and lifetime correlating to enhanced relaxation times and moduli. Higher particle volume fractions yield more persistent bonds and slower relaxation. This framework connects chain-level dynamics to macroscopic rheology, enabling computationally efficient rational design of associative colloidal materials for waterborne coatings and soft-matter applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.13911v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Bulk-boundary correspondence in topological two-dimensional non-Hermitian systems: Toeplitz operators and singular values</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13916</link><description>arXiv:2602.13916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast to eigenvalue-based approaches, we formulate the bulk-boundary correspondence for two-dimensional non-Hermitian quadratic lattice Hamiltonians in terms of Toeplitz operators and singular values, which correctly capture the stability, localization, and scaling of edge and corner modes. We show that singular values, rather than eigenvalues, provide the only stable foundation for topological protection in non-Hermitian systems because they remain robust under translational-symmetry-breaking perturbations that destabilize the eigenvalue spectrum, rendering it unsuitable for topological classification. Building on Toeplitz operator theory, we establish general results for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians defined on half and quarter planes, relating the topological indices of the associated Toeplitz operators to the number of finite-size singular values that are separated from the bulk singular-value spectrum and vanish in the thermodynamic limit. This yields a precise bulk-boundary correspondence for edge and corner modes, including higher-order topological phases, without requiring crystalline symmetries. We illustrate our general results with detailed examples exhibiting topologically protected families of edge states, coexisting edge and corner modes, and phases with both gapped bulk and edges supporting only stable corner modes. The latter is exemplified by a non-Hermitian generalization of the Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.13916v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Self-Viscophoresis: Autonomous Motion by Biasing Thermal Fluctuations via Self-Generated Viscosity Asymmetry</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14475</link><description>arXiv:2602.14475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microscale transport often relies on ubiquitous yet intrinsically random thermal fluctuations. Understanding how such fluctuations can be biased into directed motion has long been a central theme of nonequilibrium physics. Here, we introduce self-viscophoresis, a mechanism of autonomous motion based on the rectification of thermal fluctuations in a self-generated nonequilibrium viscosity field. Asymmetric colloidal particles dispersed in a thermoresponsive polymer solution induce local heating under uniform illumination, producing a spatially asymmetric viscosity profile around the particle and resulting in persistent directed motion. To elucidate the physical origin of this behavior, we develop a minimal Langevin model coupling isotropic thermal fluctuations to a dynamically updating temperature-viscosity field. The model shows that viscosity asymmetry anisotropically damps stochastic dynamics, effectively biasing thermal fluctuations into a net drift. It thus reproduces the observed directed motion without invoking deterministic propulsion terms associated with effective potentials or environmental fluid flows. Our results distinguish self-viscophoresis from conventional self-propulsion mechanisms and establish it as a general framework enabling reversible control of both the direction and dimensionality of motion.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.14475v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Antiferromagnetic Barkhausen noise induced by weak random-field disorder</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14713</link><description>arXiv:2602.14713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study numerically investigates magnetisation reversal processes driven by an external magnetic field in three-dimensional antiferromagnetic spin models with weak random field disorder. Considering an extremely weak disorder and low temperature, we observe a step-wise hysteresis loop and the appearance of short magnetisation bursts of a characteristic triangular shape; the number of bursts increases with disorder, indicative of Barkhausen-type noise. These phenomena are attributed to the simultaneous reversal at a given external field of segments composed of spins with identical neighbourhoods. A local random field orients one or more spin neighbours, resulting in small, ferromagnetic-like clusters distributed throughout the system. As disorder increases, these clusters may merge to form a labyrinthine structure within the antiferromagnetic background, facilitating brief avalanche propagation. The results demonstrate that, compared with familiar random-field ferromagnets, the observed antiferromagnetic Barkhausen noise and the related avalanche sequence have a profoundly different structure, organised into peaks associated with the transition between magnetisation plateaus. They exhibit prominent cyclical trends and disorder-dependent multifractal fluctuations, with the singularity spectrum quantifying the degree of disorder. The activity avalanches exhibit scale invariance resembling that recently found in experiments with disordered ferr\textit{i}magnets and martensites, as well as in quantum Barkhausen noise, which are associated with active geometric regions rather than individual-spin dynamics. The observed scaling behaviour is interpreted in terms of self-organised critical dynamics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.14713v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Strongly correlated Josephson junction: proximity effect in the single-layer Hubbard model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14796</link><description>arXiv:2602.14796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the proximity effect in the Hubbard model coupled to BCS superconductors describing a single-layer strongly correlated electron system in a phase-biased Josephson junction. We find two distinct gapped solutions, one Mott-like insulating (M-phase) and one proximitized superconducting phase (S-phase), separated by first-order transition with hysteresis. In the M-phase the large correlation charge gap strongly suppresses the critical current, while the S-phase behaves as a $0$-junction, with a proximitized gap that closes for $\phi=\pi$ to yield a correlated metal. Phase bias and junction transparency can thus serve as tuning knobs to switch between conducting and insulating regimes. Working within the dynamical mean field theory using the numerical renormalization group as the impurity solver, we associate M- and S-phase solutions with the doublet and singlet fixed points of the underlying superconducting Anderson impurity problem. We obtain detailed insight into the spectral structure on all energy scales. In the M-phase, the self-energy has sub-gap resonances symmetrically located around the Fermi level resulting from the splitting of the ''mid-gap pole'' found in Mott insulators; this structure accounts for phase insensitivity.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.14796v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Drift-Diffusion Matching: Embedding dynamics in latent manifolds of asymmetric neural networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14885</link><description>arXiv:2602.14885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) provide a theoretical framework for understanding computation in biological neural circuits, yet classical results, such as Hopfield's model of associative memory, rely on symmetric connectivity that restricts network dynamics to gradient-like flows. In contrast, biological networks support rich time-dependent behaviour facilitated by their asymmetry. Here we introduce a general framework, which we term drift-diffusion matching, for training continuous-time RNNs to represent arbitrary stochastic dynamical systems within a low-dimensional latent subspace. Allowing asymmetric connectivity, we show that RNNs can faithfully embed the drift and diffusion of a given stochastic differential equation, including nonlinear and nonequilibrium dynamics such as chaotic attractors. As an application, we construct RNN realisations of stochastic systems that transiently explore various attractors through both input-driven switching and autonomous transitions driven by nonequilibrium currents, which we interpret as models of associative and sequential (episodic) memory. To elucidate how these dynamics are encoded in the network, we introduce decompositions of the RNN based on its asymmetric connectivity and its time-irreversibility. Our results extend attractor neural network theory beyond equilibrium, showing that asymmetric neural populations can implement a broad class of dynamical computations within low-dimensional manifolds, unifying ideas from associative memory, nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, and neural computation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.14885v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Deterministic Switching of the N\'{e}el Vector by Asymmetric Spin Torque</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10786</link><description>arXiv:2506.10786v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: N\'eel vector, the order parameter of collinear antiferromagnets, serves as a state variable in associated antiferromagnetic (AFM) spintronic devices to encode information. A deterministic switching of N\'eel vector is crucial for the write-in operation, which, however, remains a challenging problem in AFM spintronics. Here we demonstrate, based on analytical derivation and macro-spin simulations, that N\'eel vector switching can be generally achieved via a current-induced spin torque, provided the spin accumulations responsible for this torque are non-identical between opposite sublattices. This condition occurs widely in AFM films, as symmetry equivalence between sublattice-dependent spin accumulations is usually absent, allowing unequal spin accumulations induced by Edelstein effect or a spin current. Unlike previously studied spin torques induced by uniform or staggered spin accumulations -- where either the field-like or damping-like component dominates exclusively -- the asymmetric spin torque features cooperative contributions from both components, leading to N\'eel vector dynamics that are fundamentally distinct from previous expectations. Crucially, the static states stabilized by the asymmetric spin torque enable versatile N\'eel vector switching strategies -- field-free spin-transfer torque switching during current application, as well as field-free or field-assisted spin-orbit torque switching after the current pulse -- demonstrating that established spin torque techniques from ferromagnetic spintronics can be directly adapted to AFM systems, a capability absent in previous theoretical frameworks. Our work establishes a general mechanism for current-induced N\'eel vector switching, which is in principle feasible for all collinear antiferromagnets, and thus paves the route to realize efficient writing in AFM spintronics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.10786v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Kinetic energy in random recurrent neural networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04983</link><description>arXiv:2508.04983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-dimensional chaotic dynamics can emerge in a large random recurrent neural network when the synaptic gain crosses a threshold. Recent works showed that the kinetic energy of neural activity links the chaotic dynamics and the supporting unstable fixed points (equilibria) in the phase space. Here, we investigate the kinetic-energy-centric properties of random recurrent neural networks by combining dynamical mean-field theory with extensive numerical simulations. We find that the average kinetic energy shifts continuously from zero to a positive value at a critical value of coupling variance (synaptic gain) and exhibits a cubic scaling behavior near the critical point from above. This scaling behavior is supported by numerical simulations and provides a quantitative characterization of how fast the dynamics change during the onset of chaos. The steady-state activity distribution is further calculated by the theory and compared with simulations on finite-size systems from the kinetic-energy optimization perspective as well. The activity distribution is also analyzed in a geometric angle, establishing a relationship between the original chaotic dynamics and the gradient dynamics of the kinetic energy. The trajectory length on the chaotic manifold can be derived from the stationary kinetic energy, and the associated stationary behavior is analyzed as well. This study provides a kinetic-energy-centric route toward understanding the dynamics landscape of recurrent neural networks, which may provide insights for reservoir computing and even for internal synaptic learning.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.04983v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Coherent-state path integrals in quantum thermodynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11547</link><description>arXiv:2511.11547v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In these notes, we elucidate some subtle aspects of coherent-state path integrals, focusing on their application to the equilibrium thermodynamics of quantum many-particle systems. These subtleties emerge when evaluating path integrals in the continuum, either in imaginary time or in Matsubara-frequency space. Our central message is that, when handled with due care, the path integral yields results identical to those obtained from the canonical Hamiltonian approach. We illustrate this through a pedagogical treatment of several paradigmatic systems: the bosonic and fermionic harmonic oscillators, the single-site Bose-Hubbard and Hubbard models, the weakly-interacting Bose gas with finite-range interactions, and the BCS superconductor with finite-range interactions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.11547v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Random planting with harvest: A statistical-mechanical analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16858</link><description>arXiv:2512.16858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a statistical-mechanical description of a recently introduced random planting model in which plants are represented by growing hard disks. Seedlings of negligible size are introduced at random positions in a field, grow at a prescribed rate, and are harvested upon reaching a fixed maturity diameter. Planting attempts that would lead to an overlap at any time during growth are rejected. Starting from an empty field, this simple dynamical rule drives the system to a nonequilibrium steady state in which the mean planting and harvesting rates coincide. We show that the steady state can be mapped onto a nonadditive polydisperse hard-disk fluid and exploit this mapping to develop analytical predictions based on a low-density virial expansion and on scaled particle theory. The resulting description yields an effective adsorption isotherm for the steady-state plant density as a function of the planting rate and compares favorably with numerical simulations over a wide range of parameters. At large planting rates, the density approaches the optimal value achieved by desynchronized regular planting, and the data are consistent with an algebraic approach to this limit with an exponent close to 1/3. Beyond density and yield, we show that the spatial organization of the field at high planting rates exhibits clear signatures of the same underlying geometric constraints that characterize optimal desynchronized planting. This connection is revealed through both the conventional radial distribution function and a radius-resolved pair correlation g(z,r) which highlights strong size correlations associated with parent-child seeding events and whose structure can be interpreted as a dynamically broadened precursor of the corresponding ideal mixe--size lattice. Finally, we extend the theory to sigmoidal growth laws and compute the associated virial coefficient.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.16858v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A Purely Magnetic Route to High-Harmonic Spin Pumping</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20777</link><description>arXiv:2601.20777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin pumping provides a fundamental route for dynamical spin transport, yet in its conventional form it produces only linear spin responses at the driving frequency. Recent studies have shown that spin-orbit coupling (SOC) can lift these restrictions and enable strongly nonlinear spin and charge currents. Here we propose a distinct mechanism for high-harmonic spin pumping that operates independently of spin-orbit interactions. We demonstrate that purely magnetic structures can sustain high-harmonic spin currents when an additional static magnetic order parameter is introduced perpendicular to the cone axis of a precessing magnetization. This secondary magnetic order qualitatively reshapes the dynamical response, giving rise to a cascade of higher harmonics in the pumped spin current in the absence of SOC. Our results establish a SOC-independent route to ultrafast and nonlinear spin pumping rooted solely in magnetic structure and dynamics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20777v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dynamical Phases of Higher Dimensional Floquet CFTs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00099</link><description>arXiv:2504.00099v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamical phases of Floquet Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) in space-time dimensions greater than two. Building upon our previous work [1] which introduced quaternionic representations for studying Floquet dynamics in higher dimensional CFTs, we now explore more general square pulse drive protocols that go beyond a single SU(1,1) subgroup. We demonstrate that, for multi-step drive protocols, the system exhibits distinct dynamical phases characterized by the nature of the eigenvalues of the quaternionic matrix representing time evolution in a single cycle, leading to different stroboscopic responses. Our analysis establishes a fundamental geometric interpretation where these dynamical phases directly correspond to the presence or absence of Killing horizons in the base space of the CFT and in a higher dimensional AdS space on which a putative dual lives. The heating phase is associated with a non-extremal horizon, the critical phase with an extremal horizon which disappears in the non-heating phase. We develop perturbative approaches to compute the Floquet Hamiltonians in different regimes and show, how tuning drive parameters can lead to horizons, providing a geometric framework for understanding heating phenomena in driven conformal systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.00099v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Independent e- and m-anyon confinement in the parallel field toric code on non-square lattices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03512</link><description>arXiv:2504.03512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kitaev's toric code has become one of the most studied models in physics and is highly relevant to the fields of both quantum error correction and condensed matter physics. Most notably, it is the simplest known model hosting an extended, deconfined topological bulk phase. To this day, it remains challenging to reliably and robustly probe topological phases, as many state-of-the-art order parameters are sensitive to specific models and even specific parameter regimes. With the emergence of powerful quantum simulators which are approaching the regimes of topological bulk phases, there is a timely need for experimentally accessible order parameters. Here we study the ground state physics of the parallel field toric code on the honeycomb, triangular and cubic lattices using continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo. By extending the concept of experimentally accessible percolation-inspired order parameters (POPs) we show that electric and magnetic anyons are independently confined on the honeycomb and triangular lattices, unlike on the square lattice. Our work manifestly demonstrates that, even in the ground state, we must make a distinction between topological order and (de-)confinement. Moreover, we report multi-critical points in the aforementioned confinement phase diagrams. Finally, we map out the topological phase diagrams on the honeycomb, triangular and cubic lattices and compare the performance of the POPs with other topological order parameters. Our work paves the way for studies of confinement involving dynamical matter and the associated multi-critical points in contemporary quantum simulation platforms for $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.03512v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Geometry of Chord Intertwiner, Multiple Shocks and Switchback in Double-Scaled SYK</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19013</link><description>arXiv:2506.19013v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the bulk Hilbert space interpretation of chords in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model and introduce a notion of intertwiner that constructs bulk states from states with fixed boundary conditions. This leads to an isometric map that factorizes the one-particle bulk Hilbert space into a tensor product of two boundary Hilbert spaces without particle insertion. The map enables a systematic derivation of a family of correlation functions with arbitrary finite amount of matter insertions, relevant for capturing the switchback effect-a feature of holographic complexity. We further develop a path integral framework that describes multiple shockwave configurations in the semiclassical limit. For the two-body scattering processes in semi-classical regime, we show it exhibits sub-maximal chaos at finite temperature, consistent with the scramblon dynamics associated with the "fake disk" geometry. The effective "fake temperature" governing this behavior emerges from the semiclassical limit of the quantum $6 j$-symbol associated with the out-of-time-order correlator. We further analyze multi-shockwave configurations and derive precise conditions under which the switchback effect is realized, both in terms of the total chord number and the Krylov complexity of precursor operators. Our results clarify the structure of correlation functions with multiple operator insertions, their bulk interpretation in terms of shockwave geometries in the semiclassical regime, and provide a microscopic derivation of the switchback effect in the DSSYK model.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.19013v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] TrackCore-F: Deploying Transformer-Based Subatomic Particle Tracking on FPGAs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26335</link><description>arXiv:2509.26335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Transformer Machine Learning (ML) architecture has been gaining considerable momentum in recent years. In particular, computational High-Energy Physics tasks such as jet tagging and particle track reconstruction (tracking), have either achieved proper solutions, or reached considerable milestones using Transformers. On the other hand, the use of specialised hardware accelerators, especially FPGAs, is an effective method to achieve online, or pseudo-online latencies. The development and integration of Transformer-based ML to FPGAs is still ongoing and the support from current tools is very limited or non-existent. Additionally, FPGA resources present a significant constraint. Considering the model size alone, while smaller models can be deployed directly, larger models are to be partitioned in a meaningful and ideally, automated way. We aim to develop methodologies and tools for monolithic, or partitioned Transformer synthesis, specifically targeting inference. Our primary use-case involves two machine learning model designs for tracking, derived from the TrackFormers project. We elaborate our development approach, present preliminary results, and provide comparisons.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.26335v2</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

This work demonstrates direct, spatially resolved &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;zT&lt;/span&gt; measurements within a powder-sintered bulk ruthenium-doped Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; specimen, allowing quantitative mapping of its spatial distribution. Three 3 × 3 × 5 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; specimens, equipped with thin-film Ti/Cu electrodes, were randomly selected from the same bulk. Impedance and transient-resistance responses were measured at 300 K under high-vacuum and temperature-stabilized conditions. The TDIS method achieved a &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;zT&lt;/span&gt; uncertainty below 1.5% and quantitatively resolved spatial variations ranging from 0.413 ± 0.005 to 0.475 ± 0.007 over a distance of 5 mm, providing experimental evidence that intrinsic transport-defined &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;zT&lt;/span&gt; inhomogeneity is manifested as spatial &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;zT&lt;/span&gt; variations in powder-sintered bulk materials. Distinct local variations in thermoelectric properties (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;zT&lt;/span&gt; and resistivity) were detected even within nominally homogeneous powder-sintered bulk materials. Electrode geometry also affected the observed distribution, with point electrodes exhibiting larger fluctuations (approximately 7%) than strip electrodes (&amp;lt;3%). These results demonstrate the presence of measurable spatial &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;zT&lt;/span&gt; variation within a single specimen and highlight the importance of accounting for material inhomogeneity when evaluating thermoelectric performance.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid

Abstract: We discuss electronic and magnetic properties of Na$_x$Fe$_{1/2}$Mn$_{1/2}$O$_2$, a promising Na-ion battery cathode material. Using x-ray Compton scattering, SQUID magnetometry, and density-functional-theory based modeling, we probe how electrons and spins evolve during sodiation. By comparing Compton profiles of sodiated and desodiated samples, we show that oxygen 2$p$ orbitals drive the redox process, while transition-metal 3$d$ electrons become more delocalized, explaining the metallic phase at $x=2/3$. These profile differences define a quantitative descriptor for the sodiation range associated with improved conductivity. Electron holes on oxygen, reflected in oxygen magnetization, confirm the important role of oxygen in the electrochemical activity of the cathode.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12378v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Symmetries of Spin-Splitting Induced by Spin-Orbit Coupling in Non-magnetic Crystals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12396</link><description>arXiv:2602.12396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) leads to splitting of otherwise spin-degenerate bands in noncentrosymmetric materials, even if time-reversal symmetry is present. While this gives rise to well-known phenomena such as the Rashba and Dresselhaus effects, various other terms are allowed based on the point group of the crystal and the electronic Hamiltonian. In this study, we utilize point group representations to illustrate that four different types of SOC terms (Rashba, Dresselhaus, Weyl, and Ising) can emerge in periodic solids. We construct reciprocal space energy expressions for each type of SOC-induced splitting of opposite spin bands, and follow a similar procedure to also obtain minimal tight-binding models that capture all types of spin-splittings for subgroups of the cubic parent group $m\bar{3}m$. Furthermore, we also obtain a complete list of nodal features in the electronic band structure in these systems, distinguishing between crystallographic-symmetry-imposed nodal lines and those imposed by time-reversal-symmetry only. Finally, we conclude by presenting a list of materials that host each type of inversion-breaking SOC effects. Our classification of the spin-splitting symmetries in non-magnetic systems with SOC is the counterpart of the recent classification of spin-splitting symmetries in unconventional magnetic systems without SOC, such as altermagnets and odd-parity magnets. More broadly, our work provides a basis for studying superconductivity and other collective electronic phenomena that are impacted by SOC-induced band splittings in noncentrosymmetric materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12396v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Mechanism-driven CO2 Capture and Activation on Two-dimensional Transition-metal Diborides</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12562</link><description>arXiv:2602.12562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The urgent need to mitigate rising atmospheric CO2 levels motivates the search for stable, efficient, and tunable adsorbent materials. In this study, we employ first-principles density functional theory to investigate the adsorption of CO2 molecules on two-dimensional hexagonal transition-metal diboride monolayers, M2B2 (M = Sc, Y, Ti, Zr, Nb). The adsorption energies, structural distortions, and bonding characteristics are systematically analyzed to understand how the metal center governs CO2 activation. The calculated adsorption energies range from -1.84 to -2.16 eV (or -1.98 to -4.42 eV), with Ti2B2 and Sc2B2 exhibiting the strongest CO2 binding, while Y2B2, Zr2B2, and Nb2B2 show moderately strong chemisorption. Adsorption induces significant molecular activation, evidenced by elongated C-O bonds (1.27-1.29 Angstrom) and bent O-C-O angles (129-132 degrees), compared to the linear gas-phase configuration (1.17 Angstrom, 180 degrees). Charge analysis further reveals substantial electron transfer from the monolayer to CO2, consistent with strong chemisorption and structural deformation. Correspondingly, the shift toward less negative IpCOHP(Ef) values indicates a pronounced weakening of the internal C-O bonds, reflecting increased population of antibonding pi* orbitals. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations show that the activated CO2 species is thermally sensitive: while most M2B2 surfaces retain stable adsorption at 300 K, Ti2B2 drives spontaneous CO2 dissociation into CO and O, revealing a temperature-assisted activation pathway. These findings highlight how the choice of transition metal tunes electronic interactions, adsorption energetics, and activation pathways on M2B2 surfaces. Overall, this work identifies two-dimensional transition-metal diborides as promising candidates for next-generation CO2 capture and activation technologies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12562v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Magnetoplasmons in $N$-layer structures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12722</link><description>arXiv:2602.12722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a systematic framework to investigate the magnetoplasmons of multilayer two-dimensional electron systems by using the Kac--Murdock--Szeg\H{o} (KMS) Toeplitz matrix to consider interlayer Coulomb interactions. In the absence of interlayer tunneling, we show that the single-layer magnetoplasmon branch splits into $N$ collective modes -- one in-phase mode and $N-1$ out-of-phase modes -- and derive their asymptotic behaviors in the long-wavelength limit, as well as in the limit of large layer separation and strong magnetic fields. When interlayer tunneling is present, we clarify the magnetoplasmon dispersion, both qualitatively and quantitatively, by identifying the magnetoplasmon mode associated with each interband transition, as well as tunneling magnetoplasmons arising from interband transitions with the same Landau level index. Our study presents the hybridization between the modes governed by underlying symmetries, along with an enhanced tunneling magnetoplasmon gap exceeding the associated interband gap. The KMS-based analytic formalism thus provides a comprehensive physical understanding of magnetoplasmons in multilayer structures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12722v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Investigating Disordered Granular Matter via Ordered Geometric Fragmentation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12803</link><description>arXiv:2602.12803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of occupied volume under progressive fragmentation of granular matter is studied using a purely geometric model. Rather than modeling disorder directly, properties of disordered granular assemblies are investigated by analyzing an associated family of highly ordered reference configurations that provide sharp upper bounds on accessible volume. Grains are idealized as fragments derived from a hypothetical elongated parent prism with square cross section, sequentially sliced and reassembled into configurations that maximize the enclosed volume.
  Analytic expressions are derived for the maximal attainable volume at each fragmentation stage. The volume evolution is non-monotonic: initial fragmentation produces structures whose volume exceeds that of the original object, while further fragmentation leads to monotonic decrease converging to a limiting value of 5/4 times the initial volume, independent of the total number of fragments.
  The model reveals pairs of reassembled configurations built from geometrically indistinguishable building blocks yet enclosing different volumes. These conjugate configurations constitute purely geometric analogues of distinct phases connected by rearrangement-induced transitions. Explicit relations link the idealized construction to experimentally measurable grain parameters. Comparison with experimental data on cylindrical rods shows the predicted upper bound falls within the observed packing density range, demonstrating that the model captures essential geometric features despite its simplicity.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12803v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Turing patterns in Matrix-Weighted Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13080</link><description>arXiv:2602.13080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-driven instability is a fundamental mechanism underlying pattern formation in spatially extended systems. In almost all existing works, diffusion across the links of the underlying network is modeled through scalar weights, possibly complemented by cross-diffusion terms that are homogeneous across links. In this work, we investigate the emergence of Turing patterns on Matrix Weighted Networks (MWNs), a recently introduced framework in which each edge is associated with a matrix weight. Focusing on the class of coherent MWNs, we provide a novel characterization of coherence in terms of node-dependent orthonormal matrices, showing that link transformations can be written as relative rotations between nodes. This representation allows us to deal with coherent MWNs of any size and to introduce an orthonormal change of variables capable to reduce diffusion on a coherent MWN to diffusion on a standard weighted network with scalar weights. Building on this, we extend the classical Turing instability analysis to MWNs and derive the conditions under which a homogeneous equilibrium of the local dynamics loses stability due to matrix-weighted diffusion. Our results show how network topology, scalar weights, and inter-node transformations jointly shape pattern formation, and provide a constructive framework to analyze and design Turing patterns on matrix-weighted and higher-order networked systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.13080v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Physics-Informed Glass-Structure Descriptors for Assessing the Intrinsic Reactivity of Mixed Amorphous-Crystalline Precursors in Alkali-Activated Materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13101</link><description>arXiv:2602.13101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid and reliable assessment of the intrinsic reactivity of amorphous aluminosilicates is critical for their application in alkali-activated materials (AAMs) and blended cements. Although physics-informed glass-structure descriptors have demonstrated strong structure-reactivity relationships for predominantly amorphous systems, their extension to heterogeneous precursors with mixed crystalline-amorphous phases has been limited. Here, quantitative X-ray diffraction combined with bulk compositional analysis was used to reconstruct the effective amorphous compositions of five fly ashes (FAs) and three ground granulated blast-furnace slags (GGBSs). These compositions served as inputs for molecular dynamics simulations employing a melt-and-quench approach to generate atomic-scale structural models of the glassy phases. Based on these structures, the previously introduced descriptors, i.e., average metal oxygen dissociation energy and average metal oxygen bond strength, were refined to cover a broader compositional space spanning SiO2-Al2O3-TiO2-Fe2O3-CaO-MgO-MnO-Na2O-K2O. The refined descriptors exhibit strong inverse correlations with multiple independent reactivity indicators, including cumulative heat release from isothermal calorimetry, bound water content from thermogravimetric analysis, and compressive strength, for both single precursors and binary FA-GGBS blends activated with NaOH. These results demonstrate that physics-informed glass-structure descriptors can be extended from ideal amorphous systems to heterogeneous mixed-phase precursors and capture relative intrinsic reactivity trends in alkaline solutions. The proposed framework provides a transferable, structure-informed basis for comparative assessment of precursor reactivity that complements experimental testing and may inform precursor screening and mix designs for AAM and blended cement systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.13101v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Symmetric Gapped States and Symmetry-Enforced Gaplessness in 3-dimension</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12335</link><description>arXiv:2602.12335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a comprehensive framework for characterizing the infrared (IR) phases of a fermionic quantum theory in three spatial dimensions, based on its quantum anomalies associated with a finite symmetry. We uncover a fundamental dichotomy among these anomalies: the first class of anomalies can always be realized by symmetric gapped states, while the second class can never be realized by gapped states without breaking the given symmetry, establishing the phenomenon of symmetry-enforced gaplessness in these settings. Moreover, using the construction of symmetry extension, we construct the candidate gapped states that theories with the first class of anomalies can flow to in the IR. As an application, we provide concrete predictions of the candidate IR phases of (3+1)-dimensional gauge theories based on our results. Our results also suggest that systems with discrete chiral anomalies cannot be gapped out by adding arbitrary bosonic degrees of freedom.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12335v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Deconfinement from Thermal Tensor Networks: Universal CFT signature in (2+1)-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13124</link><description>arXiv:2602.13124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks offer a sign-problem-free approach to study lattice gauge theories, but extracting precise universal information associated with the deconfinement transition remains challenging. In this work, we study the deconfinement transition of (2+1)-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories at finite temperature using a thermal tensor network approach, where the partition functions at finite temperature are formulated as three-dimensional tensor networks. These tensor networks are first contracted in the temporal direction, and the subsequent coarse-graining in the spatial directions yields a renormalized transfer matrix, the spectrum of which directly encodes the universal conformal field theory data. In particular, by numerically extracting the central charge and scaling dimensions, we verify that the universality class of the thermal deconfinement transition matches the prediction of the Svetitsky-Yaffe conjecture for $N=2,3,5$. Moreover, we show that the $\mathbb{Z}_5$ theory at finite temperature exhibits an intermediate phase with an emergent U(1) symmetry. Critical couplings are determined via Gu-Wen ratios and agree with existing Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, extrapolating these critical couplings at finite temperature enables us to determine the deconfinement transition points for $N=2,3$ at zero temperature.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.13124v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] An Always-Accepting Algorithm for Transition Path Sampling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13130</link><description>arXiv:2602.13130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a one-way shooting algorithm for transition path sampling that accepts every proposed trajectory yet samples the correct transition path ensemble for systems with overdamped stochastic dynamics. The method is based on two key elements: a procedure to propose trajectories that are always reactive, and a reweighting scheme that corrects for the bias introduced by always accepting the proposed paths. This approach significantly improves the efficiency of transition path sampling by eliminating the cost associated with generating trajectories that are then rejected. We demonstrate the algorithm by investigating the formation of CO$_2$ clathrate hydrates along different reaction mechanisms, showing that the increased efficiency allows proper sampling of the formation of crystalline hydrates at temperatures and pressures that are difficult to access with conventional algorithms.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.13130v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Generation of wave turbulence in dipolar gases driven across their phase transitions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14123</link><description>arXiv:2410.14123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultracold quantum gases with long-range anisotropic interactions host novel exotic phases of matter, such as supersolids, exhibiting both rigid and superfluid characteristics. The impact of this interplay on the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of dipolar gases, and in particular its connection with universal turbulent behavior, remains highly unexplored. Here, upon considering a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate of dysprosium atoms being dynamically driven across the supersolid-superfluid phase transition and vice versa, we unveil the emergence of a robust nonequilibrium quasi-steady state. This state displays self-similar momentum distributions exhibiting algebraic decay at large momenta, with scaling exponents supporting the existence of wave turbulence. We demonstrate that supersolidity sustaining higher-lying momenta, associated with the roton minimum, promotes the development of turbulence. Our results provide a stepping stone toward unraveling and exploiting turbulent and self-similar behavior in anisotropically long-range interacting quantum gases amenable in current experiments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.14123v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Real-time adaptive tracking of fluctuating relaxation rates in superconducting qubits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09576</link><description>arXiv:2506.09576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fidelity of operations on a solid-state quantum processor is fundamentally bounded by environmental decoherence. Characterizing environmental fluctuations is challenging because the acquisition time of nonadaptive experimental protocols limits temporal precision and can average out rapid features of the underlying dynamics. Here, we overcome this temporal-resolution limit by two orders of magnitude using a field-programmable gate-array (FPGA) powered classical controller that adaptively and continuously tracks the relaxation-time fluctuations of two fixed-frequency superconducting transmon qubits, which exhibit average relaxation times of approximately 0.17 ms and occasionally exceed 0.5 ms. We report events in which the relaxation time switches by nearly an order of magnitude over timescales of just tens of milliseconds, rather than minutes or hours as previously reported. Our real-time Bayesian estimation protocol estimates relaxation times within a few milliseconds, close to the decoherence timescale itself. Our statistical analysis further suggests that some of these fast fluctuations arise from two-level systems switching at rates up to 10 Hz, four orders of magnitude faster than earlier reports. These results redefine the timescales relevant for calibration in superconducting quantum processing units, establish a reference for rapid relaxation-rate characterization in device screening, and improve our understanding of fast relaxation dynamics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.09576v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Universal properties of the many-body Lanczos algorithm at finite size</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17424</link><description>arXiv:2507.17424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the universal properties of the Lanczos algorithm applied to finite-size many-body quantum systems.

The scaling associated with strong or approximate zero-modes is also discussed.

Abstract: We propose an effective field-theoretic framework for analyzing Transformer attention through a thermodynamic lens. By constructing a Lagrangian on the information manifold equipped with the Fisher metric, we show that, within the Shannon--Boltzmann entropy framework, the Softmax function arises as a stationary solution minimizing a Helmholtz free energy functional. This establishes a formal correspondence between scaled dot-product attention and canonical ensemble statistics. Extending this mapping to macroscopic observables, we define an effective specific heat associated with fluctuations of the attention energy landscape. In controlled experiments on the modular addition task ($p = 19$--$113$), we observe a robust peak in this fluctuation measure that consistently precedes the onset of generalization. While no asymptotic power-law divergence is detected in this finite-depth regime, the reproducible enhancement of energy variance suggests a critical-like crossover accompanying representational reorganization. Our framework provides a unified statistical-mechanical perspective on attention scaling, training dynamics, and positional encoding, interpreting the phenomena as emergent properties of an effective thermodynamic system rather than isolated heuristics. Although the present results indicate finite-size crossover behavior rather than a strict phase transition, they motivate further investigation into scaling limits of deep architectures through fluctuation-based observables.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.08216v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] CacheMind: From Miss Rates to Why -- Natural-Language, Trace-Grounded Reasoning for Cache Replacement</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12422</link><description>arXiv:2602.12422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cache replacement remains a challenging problem in CPU microarchitecture, often addressed using hand-crafted heuristics, limiting cache performance. Cache data analysis requires parsing millions of trace entries with manual filtering, making the process slow and non-interactive. To address this, we introduce CacheMind, a conversational tool that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable semantic reasoning over cache traces. Architects can now ask natural language questions like, "Why is the memory access associated with PC X causing more evictions?", and receive trace-grounded, human-readable answers linked to program semantics for the first time. To evaluate CacheMind, we present CacheMindBench, the first verified benchmark suite for LLM-based reasoning for the cache replacement problem. Using the SIEVE retriever, CacheMind achieves 66.67% on 75 unseen trace-grounded questions and 84.80% on 25 unseen policy-specific reasoning tasks; with RANGER, it achieves 89.33% and 64.80% on the same evaluations. Additionally, with RANGER, CacheMind achieves 100% accuracy on 4 out of 6 categories in the trace-grounded tier of CacheMindBench. Compared to LlamaIndex (10% retrieval success), SIEVE achieves 60% and RANGER achieves 90%, demonstrating that existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAGs) are insufficient for precise, trace-grounded microarchitectural reasoning. We provided four concrete actionable insights derived using CacheMind, wherein bypassing use case improved cache hit rate by 7.66% and speedup by 2.04%, software fix use case gives speedup of 76%, and Mockingjay replacement policy use case gives speedup of 0.7%; showing the utility of CacheMind on non-trivial queries that require a natural-language interface.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12422v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Arcalis: Accelerating Remote Procedure Calls Using a Lightweight Near-Cache Solution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12596</link><description>arXiv:2602.12596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern microservices increasingly depend on high-performance remote procedure calls (RPCs) to coordinate fine-grained, distributed computation. As network bandwidths continue to scale, the CPU overhead associated with RPC processing, particularly serialization, deserialization, and protocol handling, has become a critical bottleneck. This challenge is exacerbated by fast user-space networking stacks such as DPDK, which expose RPC processing as the dominant performance limiter. While prior work has explored software optimizations and FPGA-based offload engines, these approaches remain physically distant from the CPU's memory hierarchy, incurring unnecessary data movement and cache pollution. We present Arcalis, a near-cache RPC accelerator that positions a lightweight hardware engine adjacent to the last-level cache (LLC). Arcalis offloads RPC processing to dedicated microengines on receive and transmit paths that operate with cache-line latency while preserving programmability. By decoupling RPC processing logic, enabling microservice-specific execution, and positioning itself near the LLC to immediately consume data injected by network cards, Arcalis achieves 1.79-4.16$\times$ end-to-end speedup compared to the CPU baseline, while significantly reducing microarchitectural overhead by up to 88%, and achieves up to a 1.62$\times$ higher throughput than prior solutions. These results highlight the potential of near-cache RPC acceleration as a practical solution for high-performance microservice deployment.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12596v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] DPUConfig: Optimizing ML Inference in FPGAs Using Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12847</link><description>arXiv:2602.12847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogeneous embedded systems, with diverse computing elements and accelerators such as FPGAs, offer a promising platform for fast and flexible ML inference, which is crucial for services such as autonomous driving and augmented reality, where delays can be costly. However, efficiently allocating computational resources for deep learning applications in FPGA-based systems is a challenging task. A Deep Learning Processor Unit (DPU) is a parameterizable FPGA-based accelerator module optimized for ML inference. It supports a wide range of ML models and can be instantiated multiple times within a single FPGA to enable concurrent execution. This paper introduces DPUConfig, a novel runtime management framework, based on a custom Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent, that dynamically selects optimal DPU configurations by leveraging real-time telemetry data monitoring, system utilization, power consumption, and application performance to inform its configuration selection decisions. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that the RL agent achieves energy efficiency 95% (on average) of the optimal attainable energy efficiency for several CNN models on the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU102.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12847v1</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Bayesian diversity control for batch-based phase diagram determination</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00486A</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, Accepted Manuscript&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00486A, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY-NC.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Peiheng  Zou, Ryo Tamura, Koji Tsuda&lt;br /&gt;Machine learning methods are increasingly used in experimental design in phase diagram determination.

(GFRAL) is the exclusive receptor for growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) and plays distinct roles in various diseases. However, its impact on sarcopenia remains poorly understood. This study, comprising participants of White British and Chinese descent, demonstrated that elevated serum levels of GDF15 and its receptor GFRAL are associated with an increased risk of sarcopenia,

To explore alternative strategies, we developed a high-dimensional immune profiling framework using 40-marker spectral flow cytometry to characterize peripheral blood from healthy individuals and treatment-naïve PDAC patients across disease stages. This platform identified over 70 immune cell subsets and revealed stage-associated immune remodeling, including the expansion of effector and memory T-cell populations, accompanied by reductions in naïve and selected regulatory and innate compartments.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00409-8?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Distinct mutational signature and clonal evolution in constitutional mismatch repair deficiency-associated high-grade gliomas</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00404-9?rss=yes</link><description>Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (CMMRD) is a rare cancer-predisposing syndrome. Recent studies have advanced our understanding of the genomic and epigenomic features of this disease, however, the mutational signatures and clonal evolution of CMMRD-associated high-grade gliomas (HGGs) requires further investigation. Herein, we analyzed the mutational signature and clonal evolution of 25 CMMRD-associated HGGs.

Abstract: We introduce stratified symmetry operators and stratified anomalies in quantum lattice systems as generalizations of onsite symmetry operators and onsite projective representations. A stratified symmetry operator is a symmetry operator that factorizes into mutually independent subsystem symmetry operators; its stratified anomaly is defined as the collection of anomalies associated with these subsystem operators. We develop a cellular chain complex formalism for stratified anomalies of internal symmetries and show that, in the presence of crystalline symmetries, they give rise to Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) constraints. This includes LSM anomalies and SPT-LSM theorems. We apply this framework to modulated $G$ symmetries, which are symmetries whose total symmetry group is ${G_\mathrm{tot} = G \rtimes G_\mathrm{s}}$, with $G_\mathrm{s}$ the crystalline symmetry group. Notably, a nonzero stratified anomaly within a fundamental domain of $G_\mathrm{s}$ (e.g., a unit cell) does not always imply an LSM anomaly for modulated symmetries. Instead, the existence of an LSM anomaly also depends on how $G_\mathrm{s}$ acts on $G$. When $G_\mathrm{s}$ is the lattice translation group, we find an explicit criterion for when a stratified anomaly causes an LSM anomaly, and classify LSM anomalies using homology groups of $G_\mathrm{s}$-invariant cellular chains. We illustrate this through examples of exponential and dipole symmetries with stratified anomalies, both in ${(1+1)}$D and ${(2+1)}$D, and construct a stabilizer code model of a modulated SPT subject to an SPT-LSM theorem.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11266v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Jamming-controlled stochasticity in metal-insulator switching</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11302</link><description>arXiv:2602.11302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling phase transitions is a fundamental part of physics and has been central to many technological revolutions, from steam engines to field-effect transistors. At present, there is strong interest in materials with strongly coupled structural and electronic phase transitions, which hold promise for energy-efficient technologies. Utilizing a structural phase transition and controlling its plasticity naturally leads to built-in memory, a key feature for emulating neurons and synapses in neuromorphic technologies. Here, $\textit{operando}$ Bragg X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy is used to study the evolution of the nano-domain distribution at the micron-scale in neuromorphic devices made from the archetypal Mott insulator vanadium dioxide. It is found that after electrical switching, slow nano-domain reconfiguration occurs on timescales of thousands of seconds and that the domains undergo a jamming transition, offering control over switching stochasticity at the micron scale. More precisely, repetitive above-threshold currents plastically drive the system into a jammed/glassy state where switching becomes deterministic, while sub-threshold currents erase the short-term memory contained in the nano-domain distribution, recovering stochastic switching, thus offering a path for in-device learning. The results illustrate the importance of studying the nanoscale physics associated with phase transitions in strongly correlated materials, even for macroscopic devices, and offer guidance for future device operation schemes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11302v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Gaussian Expansion Method for few-body states in two-dimensional materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11386</link><description>arXiv:2602.11386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of trions in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) monolayers using the Gaussian Expansion Method (GEM) adapted to two-dimensional systems. Excitons and trions in monolayer TMDCs with the chemical composition MX$_2$ in the 2H phase are studied systematically. We computed the associated exciton and trion binding energies. We find in addition to the known $J = 0$ trion the existence of a bound state with orbital angular momentum $J = 1$. The results for $J = 0$ are benchmarked against existing calculations from the Stochastic Variational Method (SVM) and Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). Furthermore, we analyze the trion internal structure and geometry through their probability density distributions, accounting for the effects of different material shows that GEM -- widely used in studies of strongly interacting few-body systems -- is well adapted to allow comprehensive and computationally efficient investigations of trions and potentially other weakly bound few-body states in layered materials. In addition, we systematically exploit the effect of strain and dieletric environment in the $J = 1$ trion predictions, illustrated for the MoS$_2$ monolayer example.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11386v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Metastable Dynamical Computing with Energy Landscapes: A Primer</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11390</link><description>arXiv:2602.11390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smartphones, laptops, and data centers are CMOS-based technologies that ushered our world into the information age of the 21st century. Despite their advantages for scalable computing, their implementations come with surprisingly large energetic costs. This challenge has revitalized scientific and engineering interest in energy-efficient information-processing designs. One current paradigm -- dynamical computing -- controls the location and shape of minima in potential energy landscapes that are connected to a thermal environment. The landscape supports distinguishable metastable energy minima that serve as a system's mesoscopic memory states. Information is represented by microstate distributions. Dynamically manipulating the memory states then corresponds to information processing. This framing provides a natural description of the associated thermodynamic transformations and required resources. Appealing to bifurcation theory, a computational protocol in the metastable regime can be analyzed by tracking the evolution of fixed points in the state space. We illustrate the paradigm's capabilities by performing 1-bit and 2-bit computations with double-well and quadruple-well potentials, respectively. These illustrate how dynamical computing can serve as a basis for designing universal logic gates and investigating their out-of-equilibrium thermodynamic performance.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11390v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Krylov space perturbation theory for quantum synchronization in closed systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11431</link><description>arXiv:2602.11431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly interacting quantum many-body systems are expected to thermalize, however, some evade thermalization due to symmetries. Quantum synchronization provides one such example of ergodicity breaking, but previous studies have focused on open systems. Here, motivated by the problem of ergodicity breaking in closed systems and the study of non-trivial dynamics, we investigate synchronization in a closed disordered Heisenberg spin chain. In the presence of large random disorder, strongly breaking the permutation symmetry of the system, we observe the emergence of spatial synchronization, where spins lock into locally synchronized patches. This behavior can be interpreted as a fragmentation of the global dynamical symmetry $S^+$ into a collection of local dynamical symmetries, each characterized by a distinct frequency. In the weak-disorder regime, still without permutation symmetry, we show that the synchronization mechanism can be understood perturbatively within Krylov space. In the absence of disorder, the Krylov space associated with the dynamical symmetry $S^+$ is two-dimensional. Introducing disorder couples this subspace to the remainder of the Krylov space. This coupling leads only to a second-order correction to the frequency of the dynamical symmetry, thereby preserving coherent oscillations despite the presence of small disorder. At stronger disorder, the perturbation modifies $S^+$ so that it acquires a finite lifetime, providing an example of a transient dynamical symmetry.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11431v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Thermodynamics of Shastry-Sutherland Model under Magnetic Field</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11589</link><description>arXiv:2602.11589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent experimental discovery of the $T$-linear specific heat in pressurized and magnetized Shastry-Sutherland Mott insulator SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$, we perform the state-of-the-art thermal tensor-network computation on the Shastry-Sutherland model under a magnetic field. Our simulation results suggest the existence of a symmetric intermediate phase with $T$-linear specific heat at low temperature, occupying a large parameter space and separating the plaquette-singlet phase and antiferromagnetic phase at low fields and other symmetry-breaking phases at high fields before the system is fully polarized. Such an unexpected novel state bears an astonishing similarity to the experimental findings in the material. It opens the door to further investigations of the possible liberation of deconfined magnetized Dirac spinons by the competing interactions in this highly frustrated quantum magnet model, and by the combined effects of magnetic field and pressure in the the associated Shastry-Sutherland Mott insulator SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11589v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spin-Chain Incipient Magnetocaloric Effect and Rare-Earth Controlled Switching in the Haldane-Chain System, R2BaNiO5</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11634</link><description>arXiv:2602.11634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have experimentally investigated the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) of a prototype spin-frustrated one-dimensional spin-chain system, the famous Haldane-chain system, R2BaNiO5 (R = Nd, Gd, Er, Dy). The significant MCE is observed far above long-range ordering, even in the paramagnetic region, which is attributed to the change in magnetic entropy due to short-range spin correlation arising from (low-dimensional) magnetic frustration. Such a spin-chain incipient MCE above long-range ordering is rarely reported. Interestingly, multiple magnetocaloric switching from conventional to inverse MCE (and vice versa) are observed below long-range magnetic ordering, as a function of temperature and magnetic field, for the R = Nd, Dy, and Er members. However, such MCE switching is absent in the Gd member, which is an S-state atom (orbital moment L = 0). Our systematic investigation of this series demonstrates that the interplay between crystal-electric field (CEF), strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and rare earth anisotropy of R-ions play an important role in spin reorientation, leading to multiple MCE switching due to intriguing changes in magnetic and lattice entropy. The maximum change of entropy for Er, Gd, Dy and Nd is 7.8, 6.8, 4.0 and 1.0 J Kg-1 K-1 respectively. Our study presents a pathway for tuning MCE switching and the MCE effect over large temperature regions in d-f coupled spin-frustrated and spin-chain oxide systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11634v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] First-order phase transition in atom-molecule quantum degenerate mixtures with coherent three-body recombination</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11637</link><description>arXiv:2602.11637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We map the phase diagram of a two-mode atom-molecule Bose-Einstein condensate with Fano-Feshbach and coherent three-body recombination (cTBR) terms. The standard second order phase transition observed as the molecular energy is tuned through the Feshbach resonance, is replaced by a first order transition when cTBR becomes prominent, due to a double-well structure in the free energy landscape. This transition is associated with atom-molecule entanglement, bistability, and molecular metastability. Our results establish cTBR as a powerful knob for quantum state engineering and control of reaction dynamics in ultracold chemistry.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11637v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Ordered states of undoped AB bilayer graphene: bias induced cascade of transitions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11647</link><description>arXiv:2602.11647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using mean-field theory, we determine the electronic phase diagram of undoped AB-stacked bilayer graphene in the presence of a transverse electric field. In addition to multiple competing electronic instabilities characterized by excitonic order parameters, our framework incorporates the long-range Coulomb energy associated with interlayer polarization. This long-range interaction plays a crucial role, as it significantly influences both the structure and the relative energies of the competing ordered states. We derive a set of self-consistency equations and solve them both numerically and analytically. Our findings reveal that, as the bias field is varied, the bilayer undergoes a cascade of first-order transitions between several ordered insulating phases for which order-parameter structures are explicitly identified. Some of these phases are characterized by two inequivalent single-particle gaps, whose magnitudes depend on the valley and spin quantum numbers. Field-driven transitions are accompanied by discontinuous and non-monotonic variations of the single-electron gap. We relate our results to Hartree-Fock numerical calculations and to experimental research, including observations of fractional metallic phases that emerge upon doping the bilayer system.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11647v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Phase-Space Topology and Spectral Flow in Screened Magnetized Plasmas</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11763</link><description>arXiv:2602.11763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological wave phenomena in continuous media are fundamentally challenged by unbounded spectra and the absence of a compact Brillouin zone, which obstruct conventional bulk--interface formulations. We develop a unified phase-space framework for screened magnetized plasma based on a pseudo-Hermitian formulation with a positive-definite metric, enabling a generalized Schr\"odinger description and a Weyl-symbol analysis of the bulk generator. We show that the bulk symbol hosts isolated band degeneracies acting as Berry--Chern monopoles, including a higher-order spin-1 degeneracy with topological charge $+2$ that generically splits into two spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ Weyl points under symmetry breaking. To characterize topology in this noncompact setting, we introduce a strip-gap Chern number associated with finite real-frequency strips of the bulk spectrum, extending band Chern topology to continuum systems. This invariant governs the spectral flow of interface modes induced by spatial variations of the magnetic field and establishes a bulk--interface correspondence at the level of phase-space symbols. By solving the interface eigenvalue problem, we demonstrate that the net spectral flow across the strip gap is determined by the enclosed monopole charge. We further show that this correspondence persists under collisional damping, provided that a finite strip gap remains and no exceptional points enter it. Our results provide a systematic phase-space framework for topological wave transport in continuous media beyond compact-band and idealized Hermitian settings.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11763v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method with spin-orbit coupling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11866</link><description>arXiv:2602.11866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is incorporated into the phaseless plane-wave-based auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (pw-AFQMC) method. This integration is implemented using optimized multiple-projector norm-conserving pseudopotentials, which are derived from the fully-relativistic (FR) atomic all-electron Dirac-like equation. The inclusion of SOC enables accurate phaseless pw-AFQMC calculations that capture both electronic correlation and SOC effects concurrently, greatly improving the method's applicability for studying systems containing heavy atoms. We discuss the form of FR pseudopotentials and detail the corresponding formulations of phaseless pw-AFQMC with a two-component Hamiltonian in the spinor basis. The accuracy of our approach is demonstrated by computing the dissociation energy of molecule I2 and the cohesive energy of bulk Pb, highlighting the large influence of SOC in both. Subsequently, we determine the transition pressure of the III-V compound InP from its zinc-blende to rock-salt phase by constructing and analyzing their respective equations of state.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11866v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Thermodynamic Stability and Hydrogen Bonds in Mixed Halide Perovskites</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12031</link><description>arXiv:2602.12031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of mixed halide perovskites against phase separation is crucial for their optoelectronic applications, yet difficult to rationalize due to the interplay of enthalpic, configurational, and dynamical effects. Here we present a simple thermodynamic framework for multicomponent halide perovskites of composition FA$_{1-x}$MA$_{x-y}$Cs$_y$Pb(I$_{1-z}$Br$_z$)$_3$, based on \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics. By decomposing the free energy of mixing into enthalpic, configurational, and rotational entropic contributions, we show that although the enthalpy of mixing is generally positive, the solid solutions are thermodynamically stable against phase separation due to the large configurational entropy associated with random substitution on cation and halide sublattices. Mixing reduces the rotational entropy of the organic cations, partially offsetting the configurational stabilization. However, within our model, this rotational penalty is not sufficient to overcome the configurational driving force, and a curvature analysis within a regular-solution model does not predict a miscibility gap for any of the mixing channels considered. Analysis of hydrogen-bond dynamics shows that MA--Y (Y = I, Br) interactions are more persistent than FA--Y interactions, while the dominant FA-donated N$-$H$\cdots$I hydrogen bonds remain nearly composition-invariant. Cs-containing mixtures, in which Cs$^{+}$ forms no hydrogen bonds, can nevertheless be thermodynamically stable. These results demonstrate that hydrogen bonding does not control thermodynamic stability in mixed halide perovskites. Instead, phase stability is governed by the balance between strong configurational entropy and a smaller, systematically destabilizing rotational-entropy correction.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12031v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Markov State Models for Tracking Reaction Dynamics on Catalytic Nanoparticles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12037</link><description>arXiv:2602.12037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markov state models (MSMs) are a powerful tool to analyze and coarse-grain complex dynamical data into interpretable kinetic processes. This capability is particularly important in heterogeneous catalysis, where a medley of reactants and intermediates interact on surfaces that might simultaneously experience structural fluctuations. For these very complex systems, standard transition state theory (TST) approaches are no longer appropriate, motivating alternative approaches that can retain dynamical complexity while providing physical insight. With machine learned interatomic potentials being more and more ubiquitous, directly simulating complex catalytic systems with molecular dynamics (MD) is becoming increasingly feasible. Extending MSMs to dynamically coarse grain MD simulation data of catalytic processes, we analyze hydrogen dynamics on rhodium catalysts with slab and nanoparticle geometries over a range of hydrogen surface concentrations. Somewhat counterintuitively, nanoparticle features, such as corners and edges, effectively slow down the association/dissociation process, and the cooperative behavior of hydrogen-hydrogen interactions leads to a non-monotonic concentration dependence of the rates, which would not be predicted with standard TST.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12037v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A critical assessment of bonding descriptors for predicting materials properties</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12109</link><description>arXiv:2602.12109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most machine learning models for materials science rely on descriptors based on materials compositions and structures, even though the chemical bond has been proven to be a valuable concept for predicting materials properties. Over the years, various theoretical frameworks have been developed to characterize bonding in solid-state materials. However, integrating bonding information from these frameworks into machine learning pipelines at scale has been limited by the lack of a systematically generated and validated database. Recent advances in high-throughput bonding analysis workflows have addressed this issue, and our previously computed Quantum-Chemical Bonding Database for Solid-State Materials was extended to include approximately 13,000 materials. This database is then used to derive a new set of quantum-chemical bonding descriptors. A systematic assessment is performed using statistical significance tests to evaluate how the inclusion of these descriptors influences the performance of machine-learning models that otherwise rely solely on structure- and composition-derived features. Models are built to predict elastic, vibrational, and thermodynamic properties typically associated with chemical bonding in materials. The results demonstrate that incorporating quantum-chemical bonding descriptors not only improves predictive performance but also helps identify intuitive expressions for properties such as the projected force constant and lattice thermal conductivity via symbolic regression.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12109v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Charged moments and symmetry-resolved entanglement from Ballistic Fluctuation Theory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12185</link><description>arXiv:2602.12185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The charged moments of a reduced density matrix provide a natural starting point for deriving symmetry-resolved R\'enyi and entanglement entropies, which quantify how entanglement is distributed among symmetry sectors in the presence of a global internal symmetry in a quantum many-body system. In this work, we study charged moments within the framework of Ballistic Fluctuation Theory (BFT). This theory describes large-scale ballistic fluctuations of conserved charges and associated currents and, by exploiting the height-field formulation of twist fields, gives access to the asymptotic behaviour of their two-point correlation functions. In Del Vecchio Del Vecchio et al. $[1]$, this approach was applied to the special case of branch-point twist fields used to compute entanglement entropies within the replica approach. Here, we extend those results by applying BFT to composite branch-point twist fields, obtained by inserting an additional gauge field. Focusing on free fermions, we derive analytic expressions for charged R\'enyi entropies both at equilibrium, in generalized Gibbs ensembles, and out of equilibrium following a quantum quench from $U(1)$ preserving pair producing integrable initial states. In the latter case, our results agree with the conjecture arising from the quasiparticle picture.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12185v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A physics-informed data-driven framework for modeling hyperelastic materials with progressive damage and failure</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11414</link><description>arXiv:2602.11414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a two-stage physics-informed, data-driven constitutive modeling framework for hyperelastic soft materials undergoing progressive damage and failure. The framework is grounded in the concept of hyperelasticity with energy limiters and employs Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to separately learn the intact (undamaged) elastic response and damage evolution directly from data. In Stage I, GPR models learn the intact hyperelastic response through volumetric and isochoric response functions (or only the isochoric response under incompressibility), ensuring energetic consistency of the intact response and satisfaction of fundamental principles such as material frame indifference and balance of angular momentum. In Stage II, damage is modeled via a separate GPR model that learns the mapping between the intact strain energy density predicted by Stage I models and a stress-reduction factor governing damage and failure, with monotonicity, non-negativity, and complete-failure constraints enforced through penalty-based optimization to ensure thermodynamic admissibility. Validation on synthetic datasets, including benchmarking against analytical constitutive models and competing data-driven approaches, demonstrates high in-distribution accuracy under uniaxial tension and robust generalization from limited training data to compression and shear modes not used during training. Application to experimental brain tissue data demonstrates the practical applicability of the framework and enables inference of damage evolution and critical failure energy. Overall, the proposed framework combines the physical consistency, interpretability, and generalizability of analytical models with the flexibility, predictive accuracy, and automation of machine learning, offering a powerful approach for modeling failure in soft materials under limited experimental data.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11414v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Experimental challenges and prospects for quantum-enhanced energy conversion: Stationary Fano coherence in V-type qutrits interacting with polarized incoherent radiation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11695</link><description>arXiv:2602.11695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum coherence offers potential for energy conversion technologies. It influences light absorption and emission, affecting energy conversion limits and efficiency. As a result, quantum coherence is being harnessed to boost performance in quantum heat engines, photocells, and photosynthetic-inspired platforms. Of particular interest in this context is the generation of Fano coherences, i.e., the formation of quantum coherences due to the interaction with the continuum of modes characterizing an incoherent process. We aim to formalize mathematically the possibility of achieving steady-state Fano coherence in a V-type three-level quantum system using polarized incoherent radiation, without requiring the energy difference between the excited levels to tend to zero. We perform this analysis by deriving the Bloch-Redfield equation from first-principles by quantizing the incoherent radiation. The resulting reduced dynamics of the system are analysed, so as to determine the lifetime of Fano coherence and identify the conditions under which it becomes stationary. We characterise distinct dynamical regimes, ranging from weak to strong pumping, in which steady-state Fano coherence emerges, and we quantitatively determine its magnitude. For each regime, we analyse the generation of Fano coherence as a function of both the intensity of the incoherent pumping and the energy splitting between the excited levels. We also assess how obtaining Fano coherence is modified by symmetric or asymmetric decay rates. These findings indicate that a three-level quantum system driven by polarized incoherent light can act as a robust resource for coherence-assisted energy conversion and storage. Finally, we discuss the experimental challenges associated with the implementation of the proposed model using an ensemble of Rubidium atoms.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11695v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Refined half-integer condition on RG flows</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12085</link><description>arXiv:2602.12085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Renormalization group flows are constrained by symmetries. Traditionally, we have made the most of 't Hooft anomalies associated to the symmetries. The anomaly is mathematically part of the data for the monoidal structure on symmetry categories. The symmetry categories sometimes admit additional structures such as braiding. It was found that the additional structures give further constraints on renormalization group flows. One of these constraints is the half-integer condition. The condition claims the following. Braidings are characterized by conformal dimensions. A symmetry object $c$ in a braided symmetry category surviving all along the flow thus has two conformal dimensions, one in ultraviolet $h_c^\text{UV}$ and the other in infrared $h_c^\text{IR}$. In a renormalization group flow with a renormalization group defect, they add up to a half-integer $h_c^\text{UV}+h_c^\text{IR}\in\frac12\mathbb Z$. We find a necessary condition for the sum to be half-integer. We solve some flows with the refined half-integer condition.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.12085v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Superconductivity in overdoped cuprates can be understood from a BCS perspective!</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25767</link><description>arXiv:2510.25767v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We summarize key experimental studies of the low energy properties of overdoped cuprate high temperature superconductors and conclude that a theoretical understanding of the ``essential physics" is achievable in terms of a conventional Fermi-liquid treatment of the normal state, and a BCS mean-field treatment of the (d-wave) superconducting state. For this perspective to be consistent, it is necessary to posit that there is a crossover from a strongly correlated underdoped regime (where a different theoretical perspective is necessary) to the more weakly correlated overdoped regime. It is also necessary to argue that the various observed features of the overdoped materials that are inconsistent with this perspective can be attributed to the expected effects of the intrinsic disorder associated with most of the materials being solid state solutions (alloys). As a test of this idea, we make a series of falsifiable predictions concerning the expected behavior of an ``ideal" (disorder free) overdoped cuprate.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.25767v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Wigner Cat Phases: A finely tunable system for exploring the transition to quantum chaos</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22169</link><description>arXiv:2512.22169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A transition to quantum chaos is characterized by a finely tunable mixed random matrix ensemble. The {\it mixed Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (mGOE)} offers a pedagogically accessible framework for simulating {\it Many-Body Localization (MBL)} transitions. It can be tuned from chaotic to localized and heavy-tailed phases in a continuous fashion, providing an opportunity to explore new phases. We numerically study how the spectral properties of mGOE evolve across these transitions. Characterization of the transition to quantum chaos is computed and analyzed via empirical spectral density, nearest-neighbor spacing, and adjacent gap, with statistical uncertainty quantification that strengthens the robustness of the evidence for transitions. The transitions are identified as the {\it Wigner Cat Phases}, due to the shape of empirical spectral density, which depend on the tunable parameter. These simulated phases in mGOE provide a valuable framework to study the {\it Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH)} and its related transitions, representing a family of systems with tunable localization and disorder.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22169v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] MING: An Automated CNN-to-Edge MLIR HLS framework</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11966</link><description>arXiv:2602.11966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by the increasing demand for low-latency and real-time processing, machine learning applications are steadily migrating toward edge computing platforms, where Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are widely adopted for their energy efficiency compared to CPUs and GPUs. To generate high-performance and low-power FPGA designs, several frameworks built upon High Level Synthesis (HLS) vendor tools have been proposed, among which MLIR-based frameworks are gaining significant traction due to their extensibility and ease of use. However, existing state-of-the-art frameworks often overlook the stringent resource constraints of edge devices. To address this limitation, we propose MING, an Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR)-based framework that abstracts and automates the HLS design process. Within this framework, we adopt a streaming architecture with carefully managed buffers, specifically designed to handle resource constraints while ensuring low-latency. In comparison with recent frameworks, our approach achieves on average 15x speedup for standard Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) kernels with up to four layers, and up to 200x for single-layer kernels. For kernels with larger input sizes, MING is capable of generating efficient designs that respect hardware resource constraints, whereas state-of-the-art frameworks struggle to meet.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.11966v1</guid></item><item><title>[Nature] Is social media addictive for teens?

Here, we investigated the role of SFMBT2 promoter hypermethylation in colorectal cancer (CRC) development and its clinical relevance. Using CRC cell lines, FFPE tissues, plasma samples, and public datasets, we show that promoter hypermethylation is associated with transcriptional silencing of SFMBT2. SFMBT2 expression was high in normal intestinal mucosa but progressively reduced in advanced adenoma, primary CRC, and metastatic lesions, accompanied by increased promoter methylation.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00394-9?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Socio-economic and environmental sustainability of biomanufactured food and agricultural products: an integrated assessment framework</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02885-8?rss=yes</link><description>Biomanufacturing of food and agricultural products is increasingly seen as a transformative solution to sustainability challenges such as climate change, resource scarcity, and food security. Products such as precision-fermented ingredients, microbial proteins, and bio-based agricultural inputs offer notable benefits but may also bring sustainability challenges when commercialised. This study introduces a sustainability assessment framework based on a systematic review of 57 studies, identifying 20 key indicators across environmental, societal, governance, and economic domains.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid

Abstract: Cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) provides strong light-matter interactions that can be used for manipulating and detecting quantum states. The interaction can be enhanced by increasing the resonator's impedance, while approaching the quantum impedance ($h/e^2$) remains challenging. Edge plasmons emergent as chiral bosonic modes in the quantum Hall channels provide high quantized impedance of $h/ \nu e^2$ that can exceed 10 k$\Omega$ for the Landau-level filling factor $\nu \leq 2$, well beyond the impedance of free space. Here, we apply such a high-impedance plasmon mode in a quantum-Hall plasmon resonator to demonstrate dispersive detection of a nearby charge qubit formed in a double quantum dot. The phase shift in microwave transmission through the plasmon resonator follows the dispersive shift associated with the qubit state in agreement with the cQED theory. The high impedance allows us to perform dispersive detection of qubit spectroscopy with a plasmon resonator having a broad bandwidth. Leveraging these topological edge modes, our results establish two-dimensional topological insulators as a new platform of cQED.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.10472v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Antiferroaxial altermagnetism</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10641</link><description>arXiv:2602.10641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The antiferroaxial state is emerging as an important ferroic order in condensed matter systems. Here, we establish antiferroaxial altermagnetism as a broadly prevalent, generic, and microscopically grounded multiferroic mechanism, in which antiferroaxial counter-rotating distortions both induce altermagnetism and enable its deterministic and reversible switching. Within a unified Landau-theory and symmetry framework, we identify a symmetry-allowed trilinear invariant coupling the antiferroaxial order, the N\'{e}el vector, and the altermagnetic order, and derive general symmetry criteria for its occurrence. This coupling locks the induced altermagnetism to the antiferroaxial order, so that reversing the latter reverses the spin splitting and associated time-reversal-odd responses, such as anomalous Hall conductivity. We provide a practical spin group dictionary mapping N\'{e}el-vector representations to the resulting $d$-, $g$-, and $i$-wave antiferroaxial altermagnetism, validate the mechanism with ligand-rotation tight-binding models and first-principles calculations, and identify many candidate materials by screening the MAGNDATA and C2DB databases. Our results elevate antiferroaxiality to a universal ferroic control knob for structurally programmable altermagnetic spintronics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.10641v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Analytic Nonlinear Theory of Shear Banding in Amorphous Solids</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10677</link><description>arXiv:2602.10677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to offer an analytic theory of the shear banding instability in amorphous solids that are subjected to athermal quasi-static shear. To this aim we derive nonlinear equations for the displacement field, including the consequences of plastic deformation on the mechanical response of amorphous solids. The plastic events collectively induce distributed dipoles that are responsible for screening effects and the creation of typical length-scales that are absent in classical elasticity theory. The nonlinear theory exposes an instability that results in the creation of shear bands. By solving the weakly nonlinear amplitude equation we present analytic expressions for the displacement fields that is associated with shear bands, explaining the role of the elastic moduli that determine the width of a shear band from ductile to brittle characteristics. We derive an energy functional whose Hessian possesses an eigenvalue that goes to zero at the shear-banding instability, providing a prediction for the critical value of the accumulated stress that results in an instability.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.10677v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Field-driven Ion Pairing Dynamics in Concentrated Electrolytes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10257</link><description>arXiv:2602.10257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate ion pairing dynamics in electrolytes driven far from equilibrium using molecular simulations and nonequilibrium rate theory. Focusing on 0.5 M $\mathrm{LiPF_6}$ in water and acetonitrile under uniform electric fields, we compute transition path theory observables including reactive fluxes and mean first-passage times of ion pairing. Moreover, we introduce a dynamical proxy of free-ion population, where its field-induced change is strongly correlated with the nonlinear enhancement of conductivity, yielding an increase of $40 \ \%$ at 50 mV/{\AA} in acetonitrile, compared to less than $10 \ \%$ in aqueous electrolytes. Further kinetic analysis elucidates that Onsager's classical theory substantially overestimates field-induced enhancement of ion pair dissociation in molecular electrolytes. This discrepancy arises from solvent-mediated dynamical pathways and field-induced dielectric decrement that suppress ion pair dissociation within explicit solvents, highlighting that a faithful description of molecular details is essential. Our results provide a molecular interpretation of nonlinear electrolyte transport beyond continuum theories and establish a general framework for quantifying nonequilibrium reaction kinetics in condensed phase systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.10257v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Anomalous diffusion in convergence to effective ergodicity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08693</link><description>arXiv:1606.08693v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of diffusion is usually studied for particles or time-evolving systems. Similar in principle, such studies can be conducted by tracking how a given function of observable properties evolves over time-akin to the evolution of observable functions-referred to as functional-diffusion. This is not the same as the system's individual trajectories, but can be regarded as a meta-trajectory. Following this idea, we measure how the approach to ergodicity evolves over time for the observed magnetization of a full Ising model with an external field. We compute the diffusive behavior of the functional across a range of temperatures via Metropolis and Glauber single-spin-flip dynamics. The system's ensemble-averaged dynamics are computed using expressions from the exact solution. Power-law behavior in the approach to ergodicity provides a classification of anomalies in functional-diffusion, demonstrating nonlinear anomalous behavior over different temperature and field ranges. Studying the ergodicity convergence of these meta-trajectories can help validate and enhance the pedagogical understanding of nonequilibrium thermodynamic systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:1606.08693v5</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dielectric Properties of Single Crystal Calcium Tungstate</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21662</link><description>arXiv:2507.21662v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This investigation employed microwave whispering gallery mode (WGM) analysis to characterize the dielectric properties of a cylindrical, single-crystal sample of calcium tungstate (CaWO$_4$). Through investigation of quasi-transverse\hyp{}magnetic and quasi-transverse\hyp{}electric mode families, we can assess loss mechanisms and relative permittivity from room temperature down to cryogenic conditions. We report the biaxial permittivity values of $\epsilon_{||} = 9.029 \pm 0.009$ and $\epsilon_{\perp} = 10.761 \pm 0.01$ at $295$ K, and $\epsilon_{||} = 8.794 \pm 0.009$ and $\epsilon_{\perp} = 10.440 \pm 0.01$ at $4$ K. Components are denoted with respect to the c\hyp{}axis of the crystal unit cell. The parallel component agrees well with the published literature at MHz frequencies; however, the perpendicular component is $4.8$\% lower. The WGM technique offers greater precision, with accuracy limited primarily by the uncertainty in the crystal's dimensions. WGMs also serve as sensitive probes of lattice dynamics, enabling monitoring of temperature-dependent loss mechanisms. At room temperature, the measured loss tangents were $\tan\delta_{||}^{295,\mathrm{K}} = (4.1 \pm 1.4) \times 10^{-5}$ and $\tan\delta_{\perp}^{295,\mathrm{K}} = (3.64 \pm 0.92) \times 10^{-5}$. Upon cooling to 4 K, the loss tangents improved by approximately two orders of magnitude, reaching $\tan\delta_{||}^{4,\mathrm{K}} = (1.56 \pm 0.52) \times 10^{-7}$ and $\tan\delta_{\perp}^{4,\mathrm{K}} = (2.05 \pm 0.79) \times 10^{-7}$. These cryogenic values are higher than those reported in prior studies, likely due to a magnetic loss channel associated with an unidentified paramagnetic spin ensemble. These findings have implications for the use of CaWO$_4$ in applications such as spin-based quantum systems and cryogenic bolometry, highlighting the potential of WGMs for novel sensing applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.21662v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Magnetic field-induced momentum-dependent symmetry breaking in a kagome superconductor</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11341</link><description>arXiv:2512.11341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When multiple degrees of freedom share similar energy scales in quantum materials, intertwined electronic orders, which exhibit broken symmetries, are often strongly coupled. Recent studies on kagome superconductors such as CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ report rotational and time-reversal symmetry breaking linked to a charge density wave. Here, we observe a momentum-selective response of the electronic structure of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ to an external magnetic field. By performing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in a tuneable magnetic field, we demonstrate that the response of the electronic structure is compatible with piezomagnetism along with strong orbital selectivity. Our results show that the origin of the time-reversal symmetry breaking is associated with the vanadium Van Hove singularities at the onset of the charge density wave order. We also demonstrate the presence of fluctuations beyond the charge ordering temperature. Our results reveal that magnetic fields can be used as tuning knobs for disentangling intertwined orders in the momentum space for quantum materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.11341v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Topologically Protected Surface Altermagnetism on Antiferromagnets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10108</link><description>arXiv:2602.10108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnetism (AM) and its associated spin-transport phenomena are typically linked to spin-split electronic band structures in bulk materials. However, the crystal surface has a reduced symmetry with respect to the bulk, which can induce AM at the surface of conventional antiferromagnets (AFMs) $\unicode{x2013}$ a local effect which cannot be detected using bulk properties. In this work we define the symmetry conditions necessary for surface AM and show how it can be topologically protected, rendering it a robust effect. We provide a minimal model for one trivial and two topological examples of surface AM. We show that the spin spectral density, accessible by spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, can exhibit a $d$-wave-like altermagnetic character at the surface, even when the full band structure is completely spin degenerate. Our topological model describes the Dirac semimetal CuMnAs, which provides an existing realization of our theory. Our results identify crystal surfaces as a platform to realize robust, topology- and symmetry-driven unconventional magnetism beyond the bulk classification of magnetic materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.10108v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Two variants of the friendship paradox: The condition for inequality between them</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06176</link><description>arXiv:2511.06176v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The friendship paradox -- the observation that, on average, one's friends have more friends than oneself -- admits two common formulations depending on whether averaging is performed over edges or over nodes. These two definitions, the "alter-based" and "ego-based" means, are often treated as distinct but related quantities. This paper establishes their exact analytical relationship, showing that the difference between them is governed by the degree-degree covariance normalized by the mean degree. Explicit examples demonstrate the three possible cases of positive, zero, and negative covariance, corresponding respectively to assortative, neutral, and disassortative mixing patterns. The derivation further connects the covariance form to the moment-based expression introduced by Kumar, Krackhardt, and Feld [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 121, e2306412121 (2024)], which involves the (-1)st, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd moments of the degree distribution. The two formulations are shown to be equivalent, as they should be: the moment-based representation expands the same structural dependence that the covariance form expresses in its most compact and interpretable form. The analysis thus unifies node-level and moment-level perspectives on the friendship paradox, offering both a pedagogically transparent derivation and a direct bridge to recent theoretical developments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.06176v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Structural Theory of Information Backflow in Non-Markovian Relaxation: TC/TCL Formalism and Minimal Phase Diagrams</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09054</link><description>arXiv:2602.09054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a structural theory of information backflow in minimal non-Markovian relaxation processes within the framework of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. The approach is based on the time-convolution (TC) and time-convolutionless (TCL) projection-operator formalisms for reduced dynamics and on the doubling construction of non-equilibrium thermo field dynamics, which provides an embedding representation of dissipative evolution.
  We introduce a general backflow functional associated with a time-dependent information measure and derive generator-based sufficient conditions for the absence of backflow in terms of divisibility properties and effective relaxation rates. This allows a direct connection between memory kernels in generalized master equations and observable transient phenomena such as entropy overshoot and revival.
  Furthermore, we propose a decomposition of backflow into classical mixing and intrinsic contributions in the doubled representation, leading to a unified classification of transient regimes. Minimal classical and quantum two-state models are analyzed as analytically tractable examples, yielding explicit phase diagrams and recovering Mittag-Leffler-type fractional relaxation as a universal envelope of non-Markovian damping.
  The framework provides a constructive TC-to-TCL procedure for extracting effective rates and organizing memory-induced phenomena in a model-independent manner.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09054v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] ReLANCE: A Resource-Efficient Low-Latency Cortical Neural Acceleration Engine</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17392</link><description>arXiv:2510.17392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Cortical Neural Pool (CNP) architecture featuring a high-speed, resource-efficient CORDIC based Hodgkin-Huxley (RCHH) neuron model. Unlike shared CORDIC-based DNN approaches, the proposed neuron leverages modular and performance-optimised CORDIC stages with a latency-area trade-off. We introduce a novel Constraint-Aware Modular Parallelism (CAMP) with Precision &amp; Stability handling to leverage maximum speedup and utilisation of hardware through hardware software co-design. The FPGA implementation of the RCHH neuron shows 24.5% LUT reduction and 35.2% improved speed, compared to SoTA designs, with 70% better normalised root mean square error (NRMSE). Furthermore, the CNP exhibits 2.85x higher throughput (12.69 GOPS) than a functionally equivalent CORDIC-based DNN engine, with only a 0.35% accuracy drop relative to the DNN counterpart on the MNIST dataset. The overall results indicate that the design shows biologically accurate, low-resource spiking neural network implementations for resource-constrained edge AI applications.

As a result, the tandem STH efficiency of photoanodes connected in series with a perovskite solar cell (1.82 eV) reaches 7.23%. Most intriguingly, our work proposes a universal strategy for enhancing light absorption that could potentially benefit other photoanodes (e.g., Fe2O3, TiO2, and WO3).</description><author>Chem Catalysis</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/chem-catalysis/fulltext/S2667-1093(25)00344-6?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

As a major air pollutant, PM2.5 not only damages the respiratory and cardiovascular systems but is also closely associated with thyroid diseases. To gain a deeper understanding of the link between PM2.5 exposure and adverse thyroid outcomes, we analyzed published epidemiological studies, summarizing the effects of PM2.5 exposure on thyroid function, structure, and related diseases, as well as its potential mechanisms.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00397-4?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[APL Materials Current Issue] Revealing intrinsic strain and domain evolution across the pristine phase transition using PbTiO 3  epitaxial films with negligible residual strain</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apm/article/14/2/021105/3379363/Revealing-intrinsic-strain-and-domain-evolution</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Displacive ferroelectrics exhibit a strong coupling between lattice anisotropy and intrinsic structural distortions, and epitaxial constraints in thin films make it essential to directly monitor strain-driven structural responses under controlled conditions. Here, we report &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;in situ&lt;/span&gt; high-temperature x-ray diffraction of hydrothermally grown PbTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; epitaxial films with negligible residual strain on (100) Nb-doped SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; substrates, where minimized substrate-induced lattice and thermal strains during deposition enable ferroelectric-phase growth without a growth-induced phase transition. Upon heating, the films undergo a discontinuous ferroelectric-to-paraelectric transition, during which partial relaxation is enabled by thermally active defect migration, likely associated with misfit dislocations. Upon cooling, the structure evolves relatively continuously, with &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; domains nucleating at the transition temperature to relieve anisotropic misfit strain, followed by gradual relaxation through domain wall evolution. These findings highlight the importance of determining the strain relaxation mediated by domain formation and, together with theoretical predictions, offer a framework for distinguishing strain–structure relationships in epitaxial thin films from those in bulk counterparts.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Materials Current Issue</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apm/article/14/2/021105/3379363/Revealing-intrinsic-strain-and-domain-evolution</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] NPC2 Suppresses Osteolytic Metastasis in Lung Adenocarcinoma via the AKT/mTOR Pathway and Tumor-Osteoclast Crosstalk</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00392-5?rss=yes</link><description>The lysosomal-related protein NPC2 affects the occurrence and development of tumors in terms of stemness, gene mutational burden and microsatellite instability of tumor cells. Here, combing with our previous scRNA-seq data, we identified the protective role of NPC2 in bone metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Bone metastases exhibited lower NPC2 expression compared to primary tumors, and low NPC2 expression was associated with poorer LUAD patient survival. NPC2 knockdown LUAD cells exhibited enhanced migration capability, and their supernatant accelerated the osteoclasts differentiation and maturation.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Thu,

Abstract: The rotational diffusion of a rigid spherical body decorated with dimers in an explicit fluid environment is reported. This model acts as a simplified representation of an enveloped virus bearing peplomers immersed in a coarse-grained fluid. Using dissipative particle dynamics, we explicitly study the hydrodynamic effects on the rotational diffusion of this virus-inspired particle subjected to oscillatory shear flow and confined between two solid-like surfaces. Since the rotational response depends on the type of imposed flow, we first characterize the oscillatory shear, identifying distinct flow regimes in terms of the so-called P\'eclet number, $Pe$. Our findings indicate that, under confinement, the rotational diffusivity is strongly modulated by the oscillatory flow amplitude and only weakly affected by the number of peplomers, since their effect is mainly determined by their dimeric structure and associated effective size. For high $Pe$, the rotational diffusion coefficient, $D_{r}$, tends to decrease as the number of peplomers ($N_{s}$) increases, whereas at low $Pe$, rotational diffusion becomes weakly dependent on the number of peplomers. However, at intermediate values of $Pe$, the interplay between oscillatory forcing and thermal fluctuations prevents the emergence of a clear trend between $D_{r}$ and $N_{s}$. Our results provide a clear picture of how, in confined environments, the interplay between fluid flow and thermal fluctuations affects the rotational diffusion of spiked particles, thereby helping to explain how fluid conditions can modify the alignment of peplomers with their potential targets.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09301v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Nodal-Surface and Flat-Band Driven Large Anomalous Nernst Effect in Epitaxial Ferromagnetic Weyl Metal Fe5Si3</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09460</link><description>arXiv:2602.09460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic topological materials such as Weyl and Dirac magnets exhibit unconventional electronic properties arising from the interplay between magnetic order and band topology, leading to remarkable thermomagnetic and thermoelectric effects. Here, we investigate the ANE in epitaxial thin films of the Weyl ferromagnet candidate Fe5Si3. A pronounced transverse Nernst response exceeding approximately 1.50 microvolt per kelvin is observed at room temperature, together with a giant anomalous Nernst angle of about 0.56, indicating highly efficient conversion between thermal gradients and transverse electric fields. Beyond the anomalous contribution, a sizable topological Nernst signal of approximately 0.43 microvolt per kelvin persists above room temperature, suggesting the possible presence of real-space Berry curvature associated with nontrivial spin textures. First-principles density functional theory calculations combined with symmetry analysis reveal an unconventional electronic structure in which Weyl nodal lines, nodal surfaces, and nearly flat bands coexist near the Fermi level. This rare concurrence of multiple topological band features produces a strongly enhanced and sharply energy-dependent Berry curvature, which governs both the magnitude and temperature evolution of the observed Nernst response. The close quantitative agreement between calculated anomalous Nernst conductivity and experimental results establishes the topological electronic structure as the dominant origin of the observed thermomagnetic transport, highlighting Fe5Si3 as a chemically simple, low-cost binary topological magnet for exploring both real-space and momentum-space Berry-curvature-driven thermoelectric phenomena.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09460v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Competing magnetic states in a non-coplanar Kagome magnet</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09479</link><description>arXiv:2602.09479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-collinear Kagome antiferromagnets (AFMs) Mn3X (X = Sn, Ga, Ge, Ir, Pt) can generate an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) despite vanishing net magnetization, enabled by broken time-reversal and inversion symmetries. However, strong in-plane anisotropy has limited studies of the AFM-AHE and electronic applications to coplanar spin configurations. Non-coplanar spin textures in these systems have been realized only in low temperature spin-glass states or at interfaces with heavy metals. Here, we report an intrinsic non-coplanar spin configuration persisting up to 400 K in cubic-phase Mn3Ge, originating from coexisting symmetric and antisymmetric exchange interactions. Competing magnetic states associated with this non-coplanar spin configuration give rise to an unconventional AHE with a magnetic-field-induced sign reversal and a hump-like feature. Our findings establish a platform for non-coplanar magnetism in AFM spintronics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09479v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Optical conductivity signatures of strong correlations and multiband superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09567</link><description>arXiv:2602.09567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the discovery of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates, there have been extensive efforts to unravel their electronic structure and pairing mechanism. In particular, understanding how the electronic structure evolves with doping is essential for clarifying theoretical models of superconductivity in nickelates. Here we present studies of the optical conductivity of Nd1-xSrxNiO2 thin films spanning the full phase diagram 0.025 &lt; x &lt; 0.30 using spectroscopic ellipsometry. The data are consistent with a two-band Drude model, which allows the decomposition of the intraband response into distinct contributions. One is from a "narrow" Drude term which we associate with electron bands, and the other a "broad" Drude term linked to the hole band with strong correlations. Increasing Sr doping leads to an expansion of the hole band spectral weight, and a corresponding reduction in the electron band, indicative of the multiband electronic structure and a doping-dependent reconstruction of the Fermi surface. Both doping and temperature-dependent optical spectra display significant spectral weight transfer from high to low energy, a hallmark of strong electronic correlations. In the superconducting state at optimal doping (x = 0.15), both electron and hole bands contribute to the superconducting condensate, signifying multiband superconductivity.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09567v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Pressure-induced superconductivity beyond magnetic quantum criticality in a Kondo ferromagnet</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09654</link><description>arXiv:2602.09654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions are an established setting for emergent phenomena driven by strong electronic correlations, including strange metals and unconventional superconductivity. These have been explored extensively in Kondo lattice materials tuned to an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point (QCP), but superconductivity emerging near ferromagnetic quantum criticality is not yet observed, and the conditions under which it occurs in proximity to ferromagnetism are undetermined. Here, we report a new setting for superconductivity in the ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice material Ce5CoGe2, where there is a ferromagnetic ground state at ambient pressure, which evolves to antiferromagnetism under applied pressures. The antiferromagnetic transition is suppressed to a zero-temperature QCP, which is accompanied by strange-metal behavior. Superconductivity does not occur at the QCP, but instead appears at pressures beyond the magnetic instability. These findings suggest that Ce5CoGe2 represents a distinct class of correlated materials exhibiting a unique scenario for the emergence of superconductivity, likely associated with unconventional pairing mechanisms beyond spin-fluctuations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09654v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Direct Visualization of Room-temperature Stair-stepped Quantum Spin Hall States in Bi4Br4</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09660</link><description>arXiv:2602.09660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological insulators host exotic quantum phenomena such as the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect, which enables dissipationless one-dimensional edge conduction. Realizing such states at room temperature and on a macroscopic scale is essential for energy-efficient electronics and quantum technologies, yet remains a fundamental challenge due to material limitations. Here, using microwave impedance microscopy, we directly visualize robust QSH states persisting up to 300 K in {\alpha}-Bi4Br4 nanowires. This stability and scalability are enabled by a stair stepped stacking configuration, a multilayer geometry in which QSH edge states from individual layers remain spatially decoupled. This configuration circumvents the stringent alignment and layer number constraints of previous proposals, allowing robust stair-stepped QSH (SS-QSH) conduction in structures several micrometers long and hundreds of nanometers high. Magnetic field and temperature dependent measurements confirm their intrinsic topological nature. Crucially, the SS-QSH and bulk signals scale with nanowire height, verifying the stair stepped origin. Our results are also successfully reproduced by finite-element analysis simulations. This work establishes {\alpha} Bi4Br4 as a practical platform for high temperature topological electronics and demonstrates a generalizable stacking strategy for designing scalable QSH systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09660v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Toroidal Confinement and Beyond: Vorticity-Defined Morphologies of Dipolar $^{164}$Dy Quantum Droplets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09683</link><description>arXiv:2602.09683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation, stability, and dynamics of 3D ring-shaped and multipole vortical quantum droplets (QDs) in non-rotating dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates held in a toroidal trapping potential. The QD dynamics are investigated in the framework of the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which includes long-range dipole-dipole interactions (DDI) and the beyond-mean-field Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) term, revealing the emergence of self-bound states. Stable stationary solutions for multipole QDs with different values of the topological charge (vorticity $S$) are shaped as necklace-like modes, with the number of \textquotedblleft beads" (multipole's order) $n=2S$, up to $S=6$. The stability area of the multipoles shrinks with the increase of $S$. For higher values of $S$ the centrifugal effect associated with the phase winding destabilizes the annular density and drives the formation of fragmented multipole droplet states. The dependence of the chemical potential, total energy and peak density on the norm (number of particles) and $S$ is produced. These findings uncover the stabilizing effect of the LHY correction and DDI anisotropy in maintaining complex QD states in the non-rotating configurations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09683v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Orbital piezomagnetic polarizability of pure insulating altermagnets in two dimensions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10076</link><description>arXiv:2602.10076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distinctive symmetry properties of pure altermagnets make them natural candidates for piezomagnetism. Previous work motivated by the piezomagnetic properties of altermagnets has primarily focused on the spin magnetization response to applied strain. In this paper we study orbital piezomagnetic effects--the orbital magnetization response to applied strain--in minimal lattice models of pure insulating altermagnets in two dimensions. We obtain general microscopic expressions for the orbital magnetization in the presence of strain, as well as the orbital piezomagnetic polarizability, i.e., the defining response characteristic of pure altermagnets. We apply these expressions to three specific tetragonal lattice models, two corresponding to $d$-wave altermagnets and one describing a $g$-wave altermagnet. Whereas the $d$-wave altermagnets are associated with a linear piezomagnetic polarizability, the $g$-wave altermagnet exhibits a nonlinear piezomagnetic effect. Our analysis reveals how the polarizabilities are related to and determined by the Berry curvature of the occupied bands. Connections to materials of current interest are discussed.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.10076v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Topologically Protected Surface Altermagnetism on Antiferromagnets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10108</link><description>arXiv:2602.10108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism (AM) and its associated spin-transport phenomena are typically linked to spin-split electronic band structures in bulk materials. However, the crystal surface has a reduced symmetry with respect to the bulk, which can induce AM at the surface of conventional antiferromagnets (AFMs) -- a local effect which cannot be detected using bulk properties. In this work we define the symmetry conditions necessary for surface AM and show how it can be topologically protected, rendering it a robust effect. We provide a minimal model for one trivial and two topological examples of surface AM. We show that the spin spectral density, accessible by spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, can exhibit a $d$-wave-like altermagnetic character at the surface, even when the full band structure is completely spin degenerate. Our topological model describes the Dirac semimetal CuMnAs, which provides an existing realization of our theory. Our results identify crystal surfaces as a platform to realize robust, topology- and symmetry-driven unconventional magnetism beyond the bulk classification of magnetic materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.10108v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] TC/TCL and NETFD Correspondence Principles for Information Backflow: A Structural Monotonicity Theorem and Minimal Phase Diagrams</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09054</link><description>arXiv:2602.09054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a unified structural framework for information backflow in minimal non-Markovian relaxation processes. The central idea is to interpret non-Markovianity as an embedding phenomenon in which observable degrees of freedom exchange information with hidden auxiliary sectors. Our approach is based on two standard formalisms in nonequilibrium physics: (i) the time-convolution (TC) and time-convolutionless (TCL) projection-operator master equations, and (ii) the correspondence principle of non-equilibrium thermo field dynamics (NETFD), which provides a doubling construction equivalent to an embedding of density-operator dynamics into a vector evolution in an enlarged space. We define a general information-backflow functional N_I associated with an information quantity I(t) and derive sufficient conditions for the absence of backflow (N_I = 0) in terms of divisibility properties of the instantaneous TCL generator. We further introduce a decomposition of backflow into classical and intrinsic thermo-field entanglement contributions, leading to a classification of transient overshoot and revival phenomena in a model-independent manner. Minimal classical and quantum two-state models are discussed as analytically tractable examples, recovering Mittag-Leffler fractional relaxation as a universal envelope. We also provide a constructive TC-to-TCL algorithm for extracting effective rates and producing phase diagrams of backflow.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09054v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Volume-law protection of metrological advantage</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09086</link><description>arXiv:2602.09086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although entanglement can boost metrological precision beyond the standard quantum limit, the advantage often disappears with particle loss. We demonstrate that scrambling safeguards precision by dispersing information about the encoded parameter into many-body correlations. For Haar-random scrambling unitaries, we derive exact formulas for the average quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the reduced state after tracing out lost particles. The result exhibits a threshold; any remaining subsystem larger than $N/2$ recovers the full QFI, while smaller subsystems contain negligible information. We link this threshold to the scrambling-induced transition from area-law to volume-law entanglement and the associated growth of the Schmidt rank. We outline two realizations -- a brickwork circuit and chaotic XX-chain evolution -- and demonstrate the protection of one-axis-twisted probes against the loss of up to half of the particles.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09086v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Topology and higher-order global synchronization on directed and hollow simplicial and cell complexes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09715</link><description>arXiv:2602.09715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order networks encode the many-body interactions of complex systems ranging from the brain to biological transportation networks. Simplicial and cell complexes are ideal higher-order network representations for investigating higher-order topological dynamics where dynamical variables are not only associated with nodes, but also with edges, triangles, and higher-order simplices and cells. Global Topological Synchronization (GTS) refers to the dynamical state in which identical oscillators associated with higher-dimensional simplices and cells oscillate in unison. On standard unweighted and undirected complexes this dynamical state can be achieved only under strict topological and combinatorial conditions on the underlying discrete support. In this work we consider generalized higher-order network representations including directed and hollow complexes. Based on an in depth investigation of their topology defined by their associated algebraic topology operators and Betti numbers, we determine under which conditions GTS can be observed. We show that directed complexes always admit a global topological synchronization state independently of their topology and structure. However, we demonstrate that for directed complexes this dynamical state cannot be asymptotically stable. While hollow complexes require more stringent topological conditions to sustain global topological synchronization, these topologies can favor both the existence and the stability of global topological synchronization with respect to undirected and unweighted complexes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09715v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Symmetric preferences, asymmetric outcomes: Tipping dynamics in an open-city segregation model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09795</link><description>arXiv:2602.09795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schelling's model of segregation demonstrates that even in the absence of social or governmental interventions, individuals with mild in-group preferences can self-organize into strongly segregated neighborhoods. Many variants of this celebrated model have been proposed by assuming agents tend to increase their satisfaction. Complementary to this traditional, utility-based approach, we model residential moves using satisfaction-independent reaction rates in a spatially extended chemical reaction network. The resulting model exhibits a counter-intuitive phenomenon: despite symmetric in-group preferences, the system undergoes a tipping transition at a critical preference level, beyond which one agent type dominates. We characterize this asymmetric phase transition in details using mean-field analysis, numerical simulations and finite size scaling methods. We find that while the transition shares key features with the Ising universality class, such as $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking and similar exponent ratios, the full set of critical exponents does not match any known universality class.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09795v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Framework for (non-)adiabatic chiral state conversion: from non-Hermitian Hamiltonians to Liouvillians</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09881</link><description>arXiv:2602.09881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adiabatic chiral state conversion (CSC) is one of the many counterintuitive effects associated with non-Hermitian physics. In quantum systems, numerous works have demonstrated this phenomenon under both non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and Lindblad evolution. However, despite considerable progress, the physical mechanism behind it has been a subject of debate. In this work, we present a unified framework that explains CSC in any non-Hermitian system, encompassing non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, Lindblad, and hybrid settings. Our framework relies on perturbative, non-adiabatic corrections to adiabatic evolution and consistently predicts CSC with only the lowest-order corrections. We demonstrate its efficacy with models of single and coupled dissipative qubits, obtaining analytical solutions for the conversion fidelity. Our analysis further reveals the role of non-perturbative dynamics, which can be present even in apparently slow trajectories. We show that this property can be utilised to considerably enhance state conversion. Finally, we demonstrate that CSC can be observed in a model without the presence of exceptional points.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09881v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Intermediate scattering function of a gravitactic circle swimmer</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15192</link><description>arXiv:2411.15192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze gravitaxis of a Brownian circle swimmer by deriving and characterizing analytically the experimentally measurable intermediate scattering function (ISF). To solve the associated Fokker-Planck equation we use a spectral-theory approach and find formal expressions in terms of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the overdamped-noisy-driven-pendulum problem. We further perform a Taylor series of the ISF in the wavevector to read off the cumulants up to the fourth order. We focus on the skewness and kurtosis analyzed for four observation directions in the 2D-plane. Validating our findings involves conducting Langevin-dynamics simulations and interpreting the results using a harmonic approximation. The skewness and kurtosis are amplified as the orienting torque approaches the intrinsic angular drift of the circle swimmer from above, highlighting deviations from Gaussian behavior. Transforming the ISF to the comoving frame, again a measurable quantity, reveals gravitactic effects and diverse behaviors spanning from diffusive motion at low wavenumbers to circular motion at intermediate and directed motion at higher wavenumbers.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.15192v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Rare Trajectories in a Prototypical Mean-field Disordered Model: Insights into Landscape and Instantons</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00107</link><description>arXiv:2505.00107v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For disordered systems within the random first-order transition (RFOT) universality class, such as structural glasses and certain spin glasses, the role played by activated relaxation processes is rich to the point of perplexity. Over the last decades, various efforts have attempted to formalize and systematize such processes in terms of instantons similar to the nucleation droplets of first-order phase transitions. In particular, Kirkpatrick, Thirumalai, and Wolynes proposed in the late '80s an influential nucleation theory of relaxation in structural glasses. Already within this picture, however, the resulting structures are far from the compact objects expected from the classical droplet description. In addition, an altogether different type of single-particle hopping-like instantons has recently been isolated in molecular simulations. Landscape studies of mean-field spin glass models have further revealed that simple saddle crossing does not capture relaxation in these systems. We present here a landscape-agnostic study of rare dynamical events, which delineates the richness of instantons in these systems. Our work not only captures the structure of metastable states, but also identifies the point of irreversibility, beyond which activated relaxation processes become a fait accompli. An interpretation of the associated landscape features is articulated, thus charting a path toward a complete understanding of RFOT instantons.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.00107v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Magnetic-Field-Induced Geometric Response of Mean-Field Projectors: Streda Formula and Orbital Magnetization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07001</link><description>arXiv:2510.07001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the magnetic-field response of interacting electron systems within mean-field theory using perturbation theory. We show that the linear response of the mean-field density-matrix to a weak magnetic field is purely geometric: it depends only on wavefunction derivatives, the Berry connections linking the occupied and unoccupied subspaces, and is independent of the interaction potential and the quasiparticle dispersion. This leads to compact, gauge-invariant projector expressions for both the St\v{r}eda formula and the formula for orbital magnetization. Our calculation explicitly elucidates the role of exchange and self-consistency in defining current vertices for orbital magnetization calculations. Our work establishes a direct connection between mean-field theory, quantum geometry and the non-interacting topological band theory.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.07001v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The impact of spurious imaginary phonon modes on thermal properties of Metal-organic Frameworks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07295</link><description>arXiv:2602.07295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metal-organic Frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as potential candidates for direct air capture (DAC) of green house gases and water. Thermal properties of MOFs, such as their heat capacity, are used to determine the energy penalty associated with the adsorbent retrieval during the Temperature Swing Adsorption process. To aid exploration of the vast experimental design space of MOFs for such applications, computational methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT) or surrogate machine learning models trained on DFT data have been developed for obtaining phonon-derived heat capacities of MOFs. However, the high cost of explicit phonon computation in large and flexible nanoporous MOFs often necessitates the use of small supercells or lower convergence criteria which decrease predictive accuracy. These approximations often result in spurious imaginary phonon modes which are commonly ignored in practice. At present, there is no clear consensus in the literature on what magnitude of negative frequency or what fraction of imaginary modes can be considered acceptable. Here, we systematically demonstrate that spurious imaginary phonon modes can introduce substantial errors in heat capacity estimates, leading to incorrect ranking of MOFs in thermal-property-based screening. We further show that benchmarking machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) against DFT datasets containing spurious imaginary modes can misrepresent models that predict physically meaningful phonon spectra for dynamically stable MOFs. Finally, we introduce a simple, rapid post-processing workflow that can be applied to standard phonon calculations to effectively correct heat capacity estimates and account for spurious imaginary modes in MOFs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.07295v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum metrology through spectral measurements in quantum optics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04300</link><description>arXiv:2509.04300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuously monitored quantum systems are emerging as promising platforms for quantum metrology, where a central challenge is to identify measurement strategies that optimally extract information about unknown parameters encoded in the complex quantum state of emitted radiation. Different measurement strategies effectively access distinct temporal modes of the emitted field, and the resulting choice of mode can strongly impact the information available for parameter estimation. While a ubiquitous approach in quantum optics is to select frequency modes through spectral filtering, the metrological potential of this technique has not yet been systematically quantified. We develop a theoretical framework to assess this potential by modeling spectral detection as a cascaded quantum system, allowing us to reconstruct the full density matrix of frequency-filtered photonic modes and to compute their associated Fisher information. This framework provides a minimal yet general method to benchmark the performance of spectral measurements in quantum optics, allowing to identify optimal filtering strategies in terms of frequency selection, detector linewidth, and metrological gain accessible through higher-order frequency-resolved correlations and mean-field engineering. These results lay the groundwork for identifying and designing optimal sensing strategies in practical quantum-optical platforms.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.04300v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Accelerating Post-Quantum Cryptography via LLM-Driven Hardware-Software Co-Design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09410</link><description>arXiv:2602.09410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is crucial for securing data against emerging quantum threats. However, its algorithms are computationally complex and difficult to implement efficiently on hardware. In this paper, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate the hardware-software co-design process for PQC, with a focus on the FALCON digital signature scheme. We present a novel framework that leverages LLMs to analyze PQC algorithms, identify performance-critical components, and generate candidate hardware descriptions for FPGA implementation. We present the first quantitative comparison between LLM-driven synthesis and conventional HLS-based approaches for low-level compute-intensive kernels in FALCON, showing that human-in-the-loop LLM-generated accelerators can achieve up to 2.6x speedup in kernel execution time with shorter critical paths, while highlighting trade-offs in resource utilization and power consumption. Our results suggest that LLMs can minimize design effort and development time by automating FPGA accelerator design iterations for PQC algorithms, offering a promising new direction for rapid and adaptive PQC accelerator design on FPGAs.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09410v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Development of an Energy-Efficient and Real-Time Data Movement Strategy for Next-Generation Heterogeneous Mixed-Criticality Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09554</link><description>arXiv:2602.09554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial domains such as automotive, robotics, and aerospace are rapidly evolving to satisfy the increasing demand for machine-learning-driven Autonomy, Connectivity, Electrification, and Shared mobility (ACES). This paradigm shift inherently and significantly increases the requirement for onboard computing performance and high-performance communication infrastructure. At the same time, Moore's Law and Dennard Scaling are grinding to a halt, in turn, driving computing systems to larger scales and higher levels of heterogeneity and specialization, through application-specific hardware accelerators, instead of relying on technological scaling only. Approaching ACES requires this substantial amount of compute at an increasingly high energy-efficiency, since most use cases are fundamentally resource-bound. This increase in compute performance and heterogeneity goes hand in hand with a growing demand for high memory bandwidth and capacity as the driving applications grow in complexity, operating on huge and progressively irregular data sets and further requiring a steady influx of sensor data, increasing pressure both on on-chip and off-chip interconnect systems. Further, ACES combines real-time time-critical with general compute tasks on the same physical platform, sharing communication, storage, and micro-architectural resources. These heterogeneous mixed-criticality systems (MCSs) place additional pressure on the interconnect, demanding minimal contention between the different criticality levels to sustain a high degree of predictability. Fulfilling the performance and energy-efficiency requirements across a wide range of industrial applications requires a carefully co-designed process of the memory system with the use cases as well as the compute units and accelerators.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.09554v1</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Catalysis] Direct synthesis of phenyl isocyanate by carbonylation of nitrobenzene, catalyzed by palladium/phenanthroline complexes: promoting effect of phosphorus acids</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021951726000874?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: Available online 9 February 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of Catalysis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Doaa R.

T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data from UK Biobank (UKB) participants were utilized to develop a Three-Dimensional Vision Transformer (3D-ViT) model for predicting brain age and computing BAG, an imaging-derived indicator of biological aging. Causal BAG-CVD relationships were assessed through bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR). The results substantiated significant brain-heart interactions, revealing that Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) and Chronic Ischaemic Heart Disease (CIH) were associated with decelerated brain aging (OR=0.783; OR=0.847), while an elevated BAG correlated with a reduced risk of AMI and CIH (OR=0.954; OR=0.969).</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00362-7?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Parallel processing of distinct facial signals for the rapid evaluation of social agents.</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00353-6?rss=yes</link><description>The distributed model of primate face perception proposes that distinct facial signals, such as emotional valence and sex, are processed by separate neural mechanisms. A key prediction is that cues about a face’s emotion and sex are extracted at different processing stages. To test this, we decoded time-resolved patterns of brain activity evoked by a large set of unfamiliar, naturalistic faces. Behavioural ratings were first collected to characterise the perceived emotional valence and sex of 900 faces.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00353-6?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Foraging theory, which is rooted in ecology and evolutionary theory, has helped advance this pursuit but has largely focused on individual decision-making processes. In this article, we extend beyond individual agents and propose social foraging as a promising avenue to study social decisions. We synthesize key socio-cognitive elements of social interactions that are particularly amenable to study through foraging paradigms, such as social inference, coordination and collective behavior, especially in humans.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00315-9?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Enhancing molecular structure elucidation with reasoning-capable LLMs</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2026/DD/D5DD00359H</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/image/GA?id=D5DD00359H" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2026, Advance Article&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00359H, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY-NC.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Martin Priessner, Richard J.

Abstract: Metal-organic Frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as potential candidates for direct air capture (DAC) of green house gases and water. Thermal properties of MOFs, such as their heat capacity, are used to determine the energy penalty associated with the adsorbent retrieval during the Temperature Swing Adsorption process. To aid exploration of the vast experimental design space of MOFs for such applications, computational methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT) or surrogate machine learning models trained on DFT data have been developed for obtaining phonon-derived heat capacities of MOFs. However, the high cost of explicit phonon computation in large and flexible nanoporous MOFs often necessitates the use of small supercells or lower convergence criteria which decrease predictive accuracy. These approximations often result in spurious imaginary phonon modes which are commonly ignored in practice. At present, there is no clear consensus in the literature on what magnitude of negative frequency or what fraction of imaginary modes can be considered acceptable. Here, we systematically demonstrate that spurious imaginary phonon modes can introduce substantial errors in heat capacity estimates, leading to incorrect ranking of MOFs in thermal-property-based screening. We further show that benchmarking machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) against DFT datasets containing spurious imaginary modes can misrepresent models that predict physically meaningful phonon spectra for dynamically stable MOFs. Finally, we introduce a simple, rapid post-processing workflow that can be applied to standard phonon calculations to effectively correct heat capacity estimates and account for spurious imaginary modes in MOFs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.07295v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Theory of Integer Quantum Hall Effect in Irrational Magnetic Field</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07461</link><description>arXiv:2602.07461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conventional theory of the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) fails for irrational magnetic fields owing to the breakdown of magnetic translational symmetry. Here, based on the recently proposed incommensurate energy band (IEB) theory, we present a universal IQHE theory that does not rely on magnetic translation symmetry and is applicable to both rational and irrational magnetic fluxes. Using the square lattice as a paradigmatic example, we first show that the IEB framework provides a superior description of its energy spectrum in a magnetic field, as it explicitly reveals the momentum-space distribution of eigenstates. Key to our IQHE theory is that each gap in the IEB spectrum is intrinsically labeled by an integer pair (m,g), defined by the corresponding Bragg planes. When the Fermi energy lies within such a gap, the occupied electron states $N_{\text{occ}}$ is determined by the k-space volume enclosed by these Bragg planes, leading to the fundamental relation $N_{\text{occ}}/N_0 = m(\phi/\phi_0) + g$. Through St\v{r}eda formula, this leads directly to the quantized Hall conductance $\sigma_{xy} = m e^2/h$ under arbitrary magnetic fields. Our work resolves the long-standing problem of IQHE under irrational flux, and establishes a new paradigm for IQHE.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.07461v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Yielding behaviour of glasses under shear deformation at constant pressure</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07650</link><description>arXiv:2602.07650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer simulations of yielding of glasses under shear have typically been performed under constant volume, strain controlled protocols. However, volumetric effects, such as the dilatancy associated with plastic rearrangements, and the observed reduction of density in shear bands, make it interesting to consider constant pressure shear protocols. We present a computational investigation on the nature of yielding of glasses under constant-pressure conditions, for different pressures. For uniform shear, the stress-strain curves at different pressures differ only by the stress scale. We find stable shear bands under cyclic shear whose steady-state width increases with an increase in external pressure, with density within shear bands being lower compared to the average values reached. Cyclically sheared well annealed glasses yield with a discontinuous dilation at the yield point, whereas the poorly annealed glasses undergo compaction before yielding accompanied by dilation. The external pressure influences the quantitative mechanical response of the glasses, but the qualitative behaviour is similar at different pressures, and remains the same as that of yielding at the constant-volume strain-controlled conditions. We discuss directions along with further investigations may be pursued, based on the results presented.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.07650v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Engineering a Bound State in the Continuum via Quantum Interference</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07809</link><description>arXiv:2602.07809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanical interaction potentials typically support either localized bound states below the dissociation threshold or delocalized scattering states above it. While bound states are energetically isolated, scattering states embed a quantum system in a continuum of environmental modes, making dissipation and loss intrisic features of open quantum systems. A striking exception are bound states in the continuum (BICs), which remain localized despite lying within the scattering continuum due to destructive interference. It was predicted that such states can arise from the interference of two Feshbach resonances coupled to a common continuum, yet this mechanism has remained experimentally inaccessible in genuine quantum systems. Here we demonstrate the formation of such an interference-stabilized state in ultracold collisions of ${}^6$Li atoms by coherently coupling two tunable Feshbach resonances using Floquet engineering. At a critical parameter point, both elastic and inelastic coupling to the continuum vanish, yielding a molecular state above the dissociation threshold. Loss spectroscopy, quench dynamics, and rf-photoassociation directly reveal the resulting decoupling from scattering states. Our observations are quantitatively captured by full coupled-channel calculations and a minimal non-Hermitian model, identifying a Friedrich-Wintgen BIC. Our results establish quantum interference as a powerful mechanism for controlling openness in quantum matter and for engineering non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.07809v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Epitaxial lift-off of La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ membranes enabled by BaO sacrificial layers and restoration of the Curie temperature</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07831</link><description>arXiv:2602.07831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrathin complex-oxide membranes provide a powerful platform for strain engineering, interfacial control, and heterogeneous integration; however, their formation remains constrained by the availability and performance of suitable water-soluble sacrificial layers. This letter demonstrates that barium oxide (BaO) serves as a highly efficient and rapidly dissolving water-soluble sacrificial layer, enabling the epitaxial lift-off and transfer of ultrathin La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO) membranes onto SiO$_x$/Si substrates. LSMO membranes with a thickness of approximately 8 nm are released using a BaO sacrificial layer grown by molecular beam epitaxy, while high crystallinity is preserved and Ba interdiffusion is limited to a narrow interfacial region of approximately 0.5 nm. Post-transfer oxygen annealing at 600 ${}^\circ$C increases the Curie temperature ($T_C$) from 342 K to 346 K by eliminating Mn$^{2+}$ states associated with oxygen vacancies generated through oxygen extraction into the BaO layer. These results show that BaO provides a fast, scalable, and compositionally simple route for complex-oxide membrane release, while brief oxygen annealing is essential to restore the optimal Mn valence state and achieve the intrinsic high $T_C$.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.07831v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Direct Evidence of a Near-Ideal Jeff = 1/2 Ground State in Triangular-Lattice Na2BaCo(PO4)2</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08361</link><description>arXiv:2602.08361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the local Co 3d electronic structure of Na2BaCo(PO4)2 using polarization-dependent X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) in combination with full multiplet cluster calculations. We employed the line-fitting inverse partial fluorescence yield (IPFY) technique to obtain accurate XAS spectra from strong insulating materials. Our combined experimental and theoretical analysis reveals a very small effective trigonal distortion of only 11 meV in the CoO6 octahedra, indicating a close to ideal condition to render a ground state with the Jeff = 1/2 character. With our cluster model we were also able to simulate magnetic susceptibility measurements along different directions in the crystal. These findings highlight Na2BaCo(PO4)2 as a promising platform for exploring exotic magnetic phenomena associated with Jeff = 1/2 ground states on triangular lattices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.08361v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Precipitation induced recrystallisation (PIX) in a Ti-Fe-Mo bcc-superalloy driven by lattice misfit</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08572</link><description>arXiv:2602.08572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beta-Ti bcc-superalloys, comprising an A2 beta-Ti matrix reinforced by ordered intermetallic B2 beta-prime-TiFe precipitates, exhibit an unusual recrystallisation that occurs with no externally applied strain (i.e. no thermomechanical processing). Thermal ageing at 750 degrees Celsius for 72 h results in refinement of the grain size from 364 um to 30 um. This grain refinement is driven by discontinuous precipitation of beta-prime-TiFe lamellae with the beta-Ti matrix from grain/phase boundaries, which is associated with significant misorientation and increased dislocation density, attributed as precipitation induced recrystallisation (PIX).</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.08572v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Equilibrium-like statistical mechanics in space-time for a deterministic traffic model far from equilibrium</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08991</link><description>arXiv:2602.08991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by earlier numerical evidence for a percolation-like transition in space-time jamming, we present an analytic description of the transient dynamics of the deterministic traffic model elementary cellular automaton rule 184 (ECA184). By exploiting the deterministic structure of the dynamics, we reformulate the problem in terms of a height function constructed directly from the initial condition, and obtain an equilibrium statistical mechanics-like description over the lattice configurations. This formulation allows macroscopic observables in space-time, such as the total jam delay and jam relaxation time, as well as microscopic jam statistics, to be expressed in terms of geometric properties of the height function. We thereby derive the associated scaling forms and recover the critical exponents previously observed in numerical studies. We discuss the physical implications of this space-time geometric approach.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.08991v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] High-resolution numerical simulations of turbulent non-catalytic reverse water gas shift</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08365</link><description>arXiv:2602.08365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A green transition in aviation requires a drastic upscaling of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The power-to-liquid process for the production of CO2-neutral jet fuel via electricity, called e-SAF, directly replaces fossil jet fuel without having to change infrastructure, aeroplanes, or jet-engines. The process combines green hydrogen with industrial exhaust gas, or captured carbon dioxide, in a circular economy concept. A key element of the e-SAF production plant is the reactor where syngas is produced. Traditional reactors use catalytic technology, which faces severe challenges due to the reduced performance over time because of catalyst degradation, clogging, and breakup due to embrittlement. A high-potential alternative is the catalyst-free reverse water-gas-shift (RWGS) reactor concept.
  The primary aim of this paper is to investigate the fundamental aspects of the catalyst-free RWGS process, such as reaction kinetics and the interactions between turbulence and chemistry. The secondary aim is to identify how a typical combustion subgrid scale models for Large Eddy Simulations (LES) perform when the chemical reactions are endothermic, in contrast to the strong endothermicity associated with classical combustion.
  It is found that even small traces of O2 in the CO2 stream can significantly increase the production rate of CO. This is attributed to the increased pool of OH. The effect is strongest at atmospheric pressure and less pronounced at higher pressure. By using the temporal jet framework to study turbulence-chemistry interactions, an algebraic equation for the prediction of the CO conversion time in a turbulent flow as a function of Damkohler number and chemical timescale is employed. Finally, it is concluded that the PaSR LES subgrid model designed for combustion reactions perform well also for the endothermic reverse water-gas-shift reaction.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.08365v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Non-Hermitian Renormalization Group from a Few-Body Perspective</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08705</link><description>arXiv:2602.08705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity plays a fundamental role in open quantum systems and describes a wide variety of effects of interactions with environments, including quantum measurement. However, understanding its consequences in strongly interacting systems is still elusive due to the interplay between non-perturbative strong correlations and non-Hermiticity. While the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) method has been applied to tackle this problem, its foundation, based on the existence of the partition function, is ill-defined. In this paper, we establish a microscopic foundation of the non-Hermitian RG method from a few-body perspective. We show that the invariance of the scattering amplitude under RG transformations enables us to rigorously derive the non-Hermitian RG equation, giving a physically transparent interpretation of RG flows. We discuss a detailed structure of such RG flows in a non-relativistic two-body system with inelastic two-body loss, and show its relation to a non-Hermitian quantum scale anomaly. Our analysis suggests that non-Hermitian complex potentials often used in high-energy physics can be interpreted as being caused by quantum measurement, where the detection of elastically scattered particles updates the observer's knowledge, resulting in a nonunitary state change of the system. We apply our formalism to nuclear physics, find the emergence of a critical semicircle, and show that several nuclei are located near the critical semicircle in the coherent neutron-nucleus scattering. We also propose that the localized dineutron in two-neutron halo nuclei can be interpreted as the quantum measurement effect on the imaginary potential associated with absorption into the core nucleus. Our result bridges different contexts of non-Hermitian systems in high-energy and atomic, molecular, and optical physics, opening an interdisciplinary playground of non-Hermitian few-body physics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.08705v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Higher-order Hall response arises from octupole order and scalar spin chirality in a noncollinear antiferromagnet</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10747</link><description>arXiv:2304.10747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noncollinear antiferromagnets can generate a transverse electrical response known as the anomalous Hall effect, even though they possess almost no net magnetization. The microscopic origin of this behaviour, however, has remained unclear because conventional measurement geometries mix different contributions to the measured response. Here, we show that applying magnetic fields in selected in-plane directions allows us to disentangle the mechanisms underlying the Hall effect in a representative noncollinear antiferromagnet. By suppressing any dipole-related signal, we isolate a purely octupole-driven Hall response that exhibits a characteristic three-fold angular symmetry. At low magnetic fields, we further observe an additional Hall-like contribution that arises from the scalar spin chirality associated with noncoplanar spin textures. Combining symmetry analysis, first-principles calculations, and transport measurements, we reveal that octupole order, dipole moments, and chirality coexist and contribute in distinct field regimes. These findings establish a framework for identifying and controlling complex magnetic order parameters for spintronic applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2304.10747v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Break-down of the relationship between {\alpha}-relaxation and equilibration in hydrostatically compressed metallic glasses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13636</link><description>arXiv:2409.13636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Glasses encode the memory of any thermo-mechanical treatment applied to them. This ability is associated to the existence of a myriad of metastable amorphous states which can be probed through different experimental pathways. It is usually assumed that this memory can be erased in the supercooled liquid, and that this process occurs on a time scale controlled by the {\alpha}-relaxation. We find that this assumption does not apply for hydrostatically compressed glasses. Annealing under pressure a prototypical metallic glass can irreversibly modify its dynamics, thermodynamics and structure, reduce the atomic mobility and lead to structural modifications of the first coordination shells which reduce the thermal stability with respect to a glass annealed in absence of pressure. When heated above their glass transition temperature, these compressed glasses do not convert into the pristine supercooled liquid, implying the existence of an additional process, beyond the {\alpha}-relaxation, contributing to the equilibrium recovery of the material. These results establish pressure as a powerful tool for engineering non-equilibrium glassy materials with tailored properties, while deepening our understanding of relaxation dynamics in disordered systems under extreme conditions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2409.13636v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Susceptibility for extremely low external fluctuations and critical behaviour of Greenberg-Hastings neuronal model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22629</link><description>arXiv:2506.22629v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the scaling behaviour of the fluctuation susceptibility associated with the average activation in the Greenberg-Hastings neural network model and its relation to microscopic spontaneous activation. We found that, as the spontaneous activation probability tends to zero, a clear finite size scaling behaviour in the susceptibility emerges, characterized by critical exponents which follow already known scaling laws. This shows that the spontaneous activation probability plays the role of an external field conjugated to the order parameter of the dynamical activation transition. The roles of different kinds of activation mechanisms around the different dynamical phase transitions exhibited by the model are characterized numerically and using a mean field approximation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.22629v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Fluctuation-induced giant magnetoresistance in charge-neutral graphene</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09988</link><description>arXiv:2512.09988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Johnson-Nyquist noise associated with the intrinsic conductivity of the electron liquid, induces fluctuations of the electron density in charge-neutral graphene devices. In the presence of external electric and magnetic fields, the fluctuations of charge density and electric current induce a fluctuating hydrodynamic flow. We show that the resulting advection of charge produces a fluctuation contribution to the macroscopic conductivity of the system, $\sigma_{\mathrm{fl}}$, and develop a quantitative theory of $\sigma_{\mathrm{fl}}$. At zero magnetic field, $\sigma_{\mathrm{fl}}$ diverges logarithmically with the system size and becomes rapidly suppressed at relatively small fields. This results in giant magnetoresistance of the system.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.09988v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Non-Universality from Conserved Superoperators in Unitary Circuits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11407</link><description>arXiv:2409.11407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important result in the theory of quantum control is the "universality" of $2$-local unitary gates, i.e. the fact that any global unitary evolution of a system of $L$ qudits can be implemented by composition of $2$-local unitary gates. Surprisingly, recent results have shown that universality can break down in the presence of symmetries: in general, not all globally symmetric unitaries can be constructed using $k$-local symmetric unitary gates. This also restricts the dynamics that can be implemented by symmetric local Hamiltonians. In this paper, we show that obstructions to universality in such settings can in general be understood in terms of superoperator symmetries associated with unitary evolution by restricted sets of gates. These superoperator symmetries lead to block decompositions of the operator Hilbert space, which dictate the connectivity of operator space, and hence the structure of the dynamical Lie algebra. We demonstrate this explicitly in several examples by systematically deriving the superoperator symmetries from the gate structure using the framework of commutant algebras, which has been used to systematically derive symmetries in other quantum many-body systems. We clearly delineate two different types of non-universality, which stem from different structures of the superoperator symmetries, and discuss its signatures in physical observables. In all, our work establishes a comprehensive framework to explore the universality of unitary circuits and derive physical consequences of its absence.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2409.11407v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Uncertainty Principle from Operator Asymmetry</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06760</link><description>arXiv:2509.06760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The uncertainty principle is fundamentally rooted in the algebraic asymmetry between observables. We introduce a new class of uncertainty relations grounded in the resource theory of asymmetry, where incompatibility is quantified by an observable's intrinsic, state-independent capacity to break the symmetry associated with another. This ``operator asymmetry,'' formalized as the incompatibility norm, leads to a variance-based uncertainty relation for pure states that can be tighter than the standard Robertson bound. Most significantly, this framework resolves a long-standing open problem in quantum information theory: the formulation of a universally valid, product-form uncertainty relation for the Wigner-Yanase skew information. We demonstrate the practical power of our framework by deriving tighter quantum speed limits for the dynamics of nearly conserved quantities, which are crucial for understanding non-equilibrium phenomena such as prethermalization and many-body localization. This work provides both a new conceptual lens for understanding quantum uncertainty and a powerful, versatile toolkit for its application.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.06760v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Short-term plasticity recalls forgotten memories through a trampoline mechanism</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22848</link><description>arXiv:2511.22848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze continuous Hopfield associative memories augmented by additional, rapid short-term associative synaptic plasticity. Through the cavity method, we determine the boundary between the retrieval and forgetting, or spin-glass phase, of the network as a function of the fraction of stored memories and the neuronal gain. We find that short-term synaptic plasticity yields marginal improvements in critical memory capacity. However, through dynamical mean field theory, backed by extensive numerical simulations, we find that short-term synaptic plasticity has a dramatic impact on memory retrieval above the critical capacity. When short-term synaptic plasticity is turned on, the combined neuronal and synaptic dynamics descends a high-dimensional energy landscape over both neurons and synapses. The energy landscape over neurons alone is thus dynamic, and is lowered in the vicinity of recent neuronal patterns visited by the network, just like the surface of a trampoline is lowered in the vicinity of regions recently visited by a heavy ball. This trampoline-like reactivity of the neuronal energy landscape to short-term plasticity in synapses can lead to the recall of stored memories that would otherwise have been forgotten. This occurs because the dynamics without short-term plasticity transiently moves towards a stored memory before departing away from it. Thus short-term plasticity, operating during the transient, lowers the energy in the vicinity of the stored memory, eventually trapping the combined neuronal and synaptic dynamics at a fixed point close to the stored memory. In this manner, short-term plasticity enables the recall of memories that would otherwise be forgotten, by trapping transients that would otherwise escape. We furthermore find an optimal time constant for short-term synaptic plasticity, matched to the transient dynamics, to empower recall of forgotten memories.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.22848v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Deep learning of committor for ion dissociation and interpretable analysis of solvent effects using atom-centered symmetry functions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09468</link><description>arXiv:2512.09468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The association and dissociation of ion pairs in water are fundamental to physical chemistry, yet their reaction coordinates are complex, involving not only interionic distance but also solvent-mediated hydration structures. These processes are often represented by free-energy landscapes constructed from collective variables (CVs), such as interionic distance and water bridging structures; however, it remains uncertain whether such representations reliably capture the transition pathways between the two associated and dissociated states. In this study, we employ deep learning to identify reaction coordinates for NaCl ion pair association and dissociation in water, using the committor as a quantitative measure of progress along the transition pathway through the transition state. The solvent environment surrounding the ions is encoded through descriptors based on atom-centered symmetry functions (ACSFs), which serve as input variables for the neural network. In addition, an explainable artificial intelligence technique is applied to identify ACSFs that contribute to the reaction coordinate. A comparative analysis of their correlation with CVs representing water bridging structures, such as interionic water density and the number of water molecules coordinating both ions, further provides a molecular-level interpretation of the ion association-dissociation mechanism in water.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.09468v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Chitosan/alginate bionanocomposites adorned with mesoporous silica nanoparticles for bone tissue engineering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22192</link><description>arXiv:2601.22192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The regeneration of oral and craniofacial bone defects ranging from minor periodontal and peri-implant defects to large and critical lesions imposes a substantial global health burden. Conventional therapies are associated with several limitations, highlighting the development of a unique treatment strategy, such as tissue engineering. A well-designed scaffold for bone tissue engineering should possess biocompatibility, biodegradability, mechanical strength, and osteoconductivity. For this purpose, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were synthesized and incorporated at different ratios (10, 20, and 30%) into alginate/chitosan (Alg/Chit)-based porous composite scaffolds fabricated through the freeze-drying method. The MSN incorporation significantly improved the mechanical strength of the scaffolds while showing a negligible decreasing effect on the porosity. All of the samples showed desirable swelling behaviors, which is beneficial for cell attachment and proliferation. The MSN-containing scaffolds indicated a decreased hydrolytic degradation in an MSN percentage-dependent manner. The fabricated scaffolds did not depict cytotoxic characteristics. The Alg/Chit/MSN30 scaffolds not only showed noncytotoxic properties, but also increased the cell viability significantly compared to the control group. The biomineralization properties of the MSN-containing nanocomposite scaffolds were significantly higher than the Alg/Chit composite, suggesting the potential of these nanoparticles for bone tissue engineering applications. Taken together, it is concluded that the Alg/Chit/ MSN30 scaffolds are considerable substances for bone tissue regeneration, and MSN has a great tissue engineering potential in addition to its extensive biomedical applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22192v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Teaching Experiences using the RVfpga Package</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14954</link><description>arXiv:2411.14954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The RVfpga course offers a solid introduction to computer architecture using the RISC-V instruction set and FPGA technology. It focuses on providing hands-on experience with real-world RISC-V cores, the VeeR EH1 and the VeeR EL2, developed by Western Digital a few years ago and currently hosted by ChipsAlliance. This course is particularly aimed at educators and students in computer science, computer engineering, and related fields, enabling them to integrate practical RISC-V knowledge into their curricula. The course materials, which include detailed labs and setup guides, are available for free through the Imagination University Programme website. We have used RVfpga in different teaching activities and we plan to continue using it in the future. Specifically, we have used RVfpga as the main experimental platform in several bachelor/master degree courses; we have completed several final bachelor/master degree projects based on this platform; we will conduct a microcredential about processor design based on RVfpga; we have adapted RVfpga to a MOOC in the edX platform; and we have shared RVfpga worldwide through one-day hands-on workshops and tutorials. This paper begins by discussing how the RVfpga course matches the latest IEEE/ACM/AAAI computing curriculum guidelines. It then details various teaching implementations we have conducted over recent years using these materials. Finally, the paper examines other courses similar to RVfpga, comparing their strengths and weaknesses.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.14954v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Report for NSF Workshop on AI for Electronic Design Automation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14541</link><description>arXiv:2601.14541v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report distills the discussions and recommendations from the NSF Workshop on AI for Electronic Design Automation (EDA), held on December 10, 2024 in Vancouver alongside NeurIPS 2024. Bringing together experts across machine learning and EDA, the workshop examined how AI-spanning large language models (LLMs), graph neural networks (GNNs), reinforcement learning (RL), neurosymbolic methods, etc.-can facilitate EDA and shorten design turnaround. The workshop includes four themes: (1) AI for physical synthesis and design for manufacturing (DFM), discussing challenges in physical manufacturing process and potential AI applications; (2) AI for high-level and logic-level synthesis (HLS/LLS), covering pragma insertion, program transformation, RTL code generation, etc.; (3) AI toolbox for optimization and design, discussing frontier AI developments that could potentially be applied to EDA tasks; and (4) AI for test and verification, including LLM-assisted verification tools, ML-augmented SAT solving, security/reliability challenges, etc. The report recommends NSF to foster AI/EDA collaboration, invest in foundational AI for EDA, develop robust data infrastructures, promote scalable compute infrastructure, and invest in workforce development to democratize hardware design and enable next-generation hardware systems.

Ferroptosis, a form of programmed cell death, is closely associated with thyroid cancer prognosis and represents a potential therapeutic target. This study evaluated the antitumor effects of ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD)-mediated RAS-selective lethal 3 (RSL3) delivery to induce ferroptosis in ATC.

BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1), a tumor suppressor gene frequently mutated in CCA, encodes a nuclear deubiquitinating enzyme involved in chromatin remodeling and cell death regulation. In this study, we investigated the role of BAP1 mutations in programmed cell death and drug response using patient-derived and prime-edited CCA organoids (CCAOs).</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00357-3?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Epigenetic Mechanisms and Steroid-Resistant Nephrotic Syndrome: The Future Potential for SRNS Diagnosis</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00348-2?rss=yes</link><description>Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is commonly managed with glucocorticoid (GC) therapy, yet about 10–30% of children do not achieve remission after an adequate initial steroid course and are classified as steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS); in adults, proportions are generally higher and heterogeneous across histologies. Currently, genetic testing can identify causative mutations in 30% of SRNS cases, highlighting the need for complementary pre-treatment stratification approaches. This review synthesizes human evidence linking epigenetic dysregulation to GC responsiveness, highlighting differential DNA methylation patterns in genes such as NLRP3 and SOCS3.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00348-2?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Differential fates of Kazald gene quartet: ancestral roles in skeletogenesis and regeneration to putative innovations in fish and birds</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00309-3?rss=yes</link><description>Gene orthology inference across species is crucial to identify gains and losses of functions. The discovery in axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) of a regeneration-associated gene identified as either Kazald1 or Kazald2 led us to investigate its evolution via an extensive cross-species analysis. Molecular phylogeny inference identified the gene as Kazald2, and revealed an undescribed four-member Kazald gene family in jawed vertebrates. Synteny comparisons demonstrated that this family originated in the two-round whole genome duplication event.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00309-3?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Development of immune-derived molecular markers for coronary heart disease via multimachine learning</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00228-2?rss=yes</link><description>Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major cardiovascular disorder primarily caused by coronary atherosclerosis, and early, sensitive diagnosis remains a clinical challenge.

However, electrically tunable NDR commonly trades tunability for circuit complexity, area, and power, constraining practical integration and fast reconfigurability. Here, we demonstrate optical control of negative differential photoresistance (NDPR) in a vertical two-dimensional tunnel junction based on Nb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; tunnel barrier. Under illumination, the photocurrent rises with bias and then falls beyond a threshold, forming a clear NDPR region. The effective negative photoresistance is continuously tuned by light power, and wavelength, spanning ∼−1 to −17 MΩ within our measurement window, while the device, as a photodetector, retains high sensitivity (responsivity up to ∼0.49 AW&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). Wavelength-dependent measurements indicate multiple photocurrent-generation pathways and suggest that the NDPR onset correlates with the Nb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;'s band structure. We further carry out simulations by integrating a lumped NDPR element into an LC oscillator circuit, which yields self-oscillation and effectively enhances the resonator quality factors. These results establish adjustable NDPR in a 2D van der Waals tunneling platform and enable light-programmable impedance for reconfigurable optoelectronics, suggesting promising potential for all-optical communication systems.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/6/063103/3379232/Negative-differential-photoresistance-for</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Gate-dependent modulation of rectification characteristics of organic electrochemical rectifiers</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/6/063304/3379054/Gate-dependent-modulation-of-rectification</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Organic Electrochemical Rectifiers (OECRs), derived from Organic Electrochemical Transistors, are promising components for flexible electronics and bioelectronic circuits due to their tunable rectifying behavior. In this study, we investigate the effect of gate electrode material on the rectification performance of OECRs using platinum (Pt), silver (Ag), and copper (Cu) gates. Our results reveal that the gate electrode potential, established through electric double layer formation at the gate/electrolyte interface, significantly influences channel conductivity and sets the intrinsic potential difference between the OECR terminals. Devices with Pt and Ag gates exhibit clear diode-like rectification, while the Cu-gated device displays non-diode-like behavior. Spectro-electrochemical measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy confirm that negative gate electrode potentials (Ag and Cu) induce hole depletion in the channel. Open-circuit potential measurements further reveal a nonlinear potential profile along the channel in the absence of external bias. These findings demonstrate that the intrinsic gate potential is a critical design parameter that governs electrochemical doping, potential distribution, and the overall rectification characteristics of OECRs.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid

Abstract: In this work we present a cavity-enhanced InAs/$\mathrm{In_{0.53}Al_{0.23}Ga_{0.24}As}$ quantum dot (QD) single-photon source in the telecom C-band with a record-low biexciton emitter decay time of \SI{67.4(2)}{ps} under resonant two-photon excitation (TPE). We observe strong multiphoton suppression associated with $g^{(2)}_\mathrm{X}(0) = 0.006(1)$ and $g^{(2)}_\mathrm{XX}(0) = 0.007(1)$ for the exciton (X) and biexciton (XX) emission, respectively. Due to a asymmetric Purcell enhancement of the XX-X cascade, the two-photon interference (TPI) visibility of XX photons under $\pi$-pulse excitation of $V_{\rm{TPI}} = 90(3)\%$ reaches the theoretical limit and clearly exceeds the $\sim60\%$ expected for standard XX-X cascades without photonic engineering. Furthermore, adding a second timed laser pulse coinciding with XX emission energy, we demonstrate stimulated TPE in the telecom C-Band. The result is an improved TPI visibility of the X photons of $V_{\rm{TPI}}=0.69(3)$ compared to TPE with $V_{\rm{TPI}}=0.61(4)$, with both being reduced compared to the theoretical values due to present dephasing effects. The advances presented in this work hold important promises for the implementation of advanced schemes of quantum communication using deterministic quantum light sources.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06140v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Thermal Einstein-de Haas Effect Induced by Chiral Phonons in Carbon Nanotubes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06392</link><description>arXiv:2602.06392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of chirality on phonon thermal transport in semiconducting chiral single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) using lattice dynamics combined with Boltzmann transport theory. We find that transverse acoustic and optical phonon modes, which are degenerate in nonchiral zigzag and armchair SWCNTs, are split in chiral SWCNTs, giving rise to finite phonon angular momentum associated with circular motion of individual atoms. This angular momentum is most efficiently generated in small-diameter nanotubes with intermediate chiral angles. Consequently, chiral SWCNTs are predicted to undergo thermally induced rigid-body rotation with an experimentally observable angular velocity via the thermal Einstein-de Haas effect.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06392v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spin splitting, Kondo correlation and singlet-doublet quantum phase transition in a superconductor-coupled InSb nanosheet quantum dot</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06573</link><description>arXiv:2602.06573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We realize a superconductor-coupled quantum dot (QD) in an InSb nanosheet, a 2D platform promising for studies of topological superconductivity. The device consists of a superconductor-QD-superconductor junction, where a bottom bilayer gate defines the QD and allows tuning of its coupling to the superconducting leads. The QD exhibits large $g$-factors and strong spin-orbit coupling. Transport measurements reveal Coulomb diamond-shaped differential conductance features with even-odd alternating sizes and pronounced conductance lines associated with the superconducting gap, confirming a few-electron, superconductor-coupled regime. At an odd electron occupation, Kondo signatures emerge, including a zero-bias peak that splits with magnetic field and is logarithmically suppressed at elevated temperatures. We further observe a doublet-singlet quantum phase transition, manifested by a clear change of Andreev bound states from crossing to anticrossing as the coupling strength increases. These results underscore the rich physics of InSb nanosheet QDs and their promise for topological quantum devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06573v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Mean-Field Theory for Heider Balance under Heterogeneous Social Temperatures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06342</link><description>arXiv:2602.06342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heider balance theory provides a fundamental framework for understanding the formation of friendly and hostile relations in social networks. Existing stochastic formulations typically assume a uniform social temperature, implying that all interpersonal relations fluctuate with the same intensity. However, studies show that social interactions are highly heterogeneous, with broad variability in stability, volatility, and susceptibility to change. In this work, we introduce a generalized Heider balance model on a complete graph in which each link is assigned its own social temperature. Within a mean-field formulation, we derive a distribution-dependent self-consistency condition for the collective opinion state and identify the criteria governing the transition between polarized and non-polarized configurations. This framework reveals how the entire distribution of interaction heterogeneity shapes the macroscopic behavior of the system. We show that the functional form of the inverse-temperature distribution, in particular whether it is light-tailed or heavy-tailed, leads to qualitatively distinct phase diagrams. We also establish universal bounds for the critical transition, where the homogeneous-temperature limit provides a universal lower bound for the critical mean of an inverse-temperature distribution governing the transition. Numerical simulations confirm the theoretical predictions and highlight the nontrivial effects introduced by heterogeneity. Our results provide a unified route to understanding structural balance in realistic social systems and lay the groundwork for extensions incorporating fluctuations beyond mean field, external fields, and network topologies beyond the complete graph.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06342v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Field theories and quantum methods for stochastic reaction-diffusion systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13377</link><description>arXiv:2409.13377v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex systems are composed of many particles or agents that move and interact with one another. The underlying mathematical framework to model many of these systems must incorporate the spatial transport of particles and their interactions, as well as changes to their copy numbers, all of which can be formulated in terms of stochastic reaction-diffusion processes. The probabilistic representation of these processes is complex because of combinatorial aspects arising due to nonlinear interactions and varying particle numbers. This review presents the main field theory representations of stochastic reaction-diffusion systems, which handle these issues `under-the-hood'. First, we focus on bringing techniques familiar to theoretical physicists -- such as second quantization, Fock space, and path integrals -- back into the classical domain of reaction-diffusion systems. We demonstrate how various field theory representations can all be unified under a single basis-independent representation. We then extend existing quantum-based methods and notation to work directly on the level of the unifying representation, and we illustrate how they can be used to consistently obtain previous known results, such as numerical discretizations and relations between model parameters at multiple scales. Throughout the work, we contextualize how these representations mirror well-known models of chemical physics depending on their spatial resolution, as well as the corresponding macroscopic limits. The framework presented here may find applications in a diverse set of scientific fields, including physical chemistry, theoretical ecology, epidemiology, game theory and socio-economical models of complex systems. The presentation is done in a self-contained educational and unifying manner such that it can be followed by researchers across several fields.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2409.13377v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Tachyonic and parametric instabilities in an extended bosonic Josephson junction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10543</link><description>arXiv:2410.10543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics and decay of quantum phase coherence for Bose-Einstein condensates in tunnel-coupled quantum wires. The two elongated Bose-Einstein condensates exhibit a wide variety of dynamic phenomena where quantum fluctuations can lead to a rapid loss of phase coherence. We investigate the phenomenon of self-trapping in the relative population imbalance of the two condensates, particularly $\pi$-trapped oscillations that occur when also the relative phase is trapped. Though this state appears stable in mean-field descriptions, the $\pi$-trapped state becomes dynamically unstable due to quantum fluctuations. Nonequilibrium instabilities result in the generation of pairs excited from the condensate to higher momentum modes. We identify tachyonic instabilities, which are associated with imaginary parts of the dispersion relation, and parametric resonance instabilities that are triggered by oscillations of the relative phase and populations. At early times, we compute the instability chart of the characteristic modes through a linearized analysis and identify the underlying physical process. At later times, the primary instabilities trigger secondary instabilities due to the build-up of non-linearities. We perform numerical simulations in the Truncated Wigner approximation in order to observe the dynamics also in this non-linear regime. Furthermore, we discuss realistic parameters for experimental realizations of the $\pi$-trapped state in ultracold atom setups.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.10543v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Structural Chirality and Natural Optical Activity across the $\alpha$-to-$\beta$ Phase Transition in SiO$_2$ and AlPO$_4$ from first-principles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03047</link><description>arXiv:2510.03047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Natural optical activity (NOA), the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light, has traditionally been associated with structural chirality. However, this relationship has often been oversimplified, leading to conceptual misunderstandings, particularly when attempts are made to directly correlate structural handedness with optical rotatory power. In reality, the relationship between chirality and NOA is more nuanced: optical activity can arise in both chiral and achiral crystal structures, and the sign of the rotation cannot necessarily be inferred from the handedness of the space group. % In this work, we conduct a first-principles investigation of natural optical activity in SiO$_2$ and AlPO$_4$ crystals, focusing on their enantiomorphic structural phase transition from high-symmetry hexagonal ($P6_422$ or $P6_222$) to low-symmetry trigonal ($P3_121$ or $P3_221$) space groups. This transition, driven by the condensation of a zone-center $\Gamma_3$ phonon mode, reverses the screw axis type given by the space group symbol while leaving the sign of the optical activity unchanged. By following the evolution of the structure and the optical response along the transition pathway, we clarify the microscopic origin of this behavior. We demonstrate that the sense of optical rotation is determined not by the nominal helicity of the screw axis given in the space group symbol, but by the atomic-scale helicity of the most polarizable atoms of the structure.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.03047v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Renormalization of Interacting Random Graph Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07186</link><description>arXiv:2510.07186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random graphs offer a useful mathematical representation of a variety of real world complex networks. Exponential random graphs, for example, are particularly suited towards generating random graphs constrained to have specified statistical moments. In this investigation, we elaborate on a generalization of the former where link probabilities are conditioned on the appearance of other links, corresponding to the introduction of interactions in an effective generalized statistical mechanical formalism. When restricted to the simplest non-trivial case of pairwise interactions, one can derive a closed form renormalization group transformation for maximum coordination number two on the corresponding line graph. Higher coordination numbers do not admit exact closed form renormalization group transformations, a feature that paraphrases the usual absence of exact transformations in two or more dimensional lattice systems. We introduce disorder and study the induced renormalization group flow on its probability assignments, highlighting its formal equivalence to time reversed anisotropic drift-diffusion on the statistical manifold associated with the effective Hamiltonian. We discuss the implications of our findings, stressing the long wavelength irrelevance of certain classes of pair-wise conditioning on random graphs, and conclude with possible applications. These include modeling the scaling behavior of preferential effects on social networks, opinion dynamics, and reinforcement effects on neural networks, as well as how our findings offer a systematic framework to deal with data limitations in inference and reconstruction problems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.07186v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Compact self-matched gyrators using edge magnetoplasmons</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05439</link><description>arXiv:2602.05439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal microwave components are indispensable in quantum information processing and cryogenic measurement. Conventional implementations, however, are bulky and incompatible with on-chip scalable integration. Recent efforts to develop compact on-chip alternatives often rely on active modulation or complex circuit architectures, which introduce additional losses and degrade performance. We demonstrate the realization of compact, self-impedance-matched gyrators based on edge magnetoplasmons in a two-dimensional electron gas. Gyrators can be used as building blocks for other non-reciprocal elements such as isolators and circulators. Our devices achieve gyration from 0.2 to 2 GHz, tunable by moderate out-of plane magnetic fields below 400 mT, and sub-mm footprint, two orders of magnitude smaller than conventional ferrite-based components. Using an electrode geometry predicted to minimize reflections, we achieve insertion losses as low as 2 to 4 dB. The self-matched design framework we utilize is broadly applicable, and can be implemented in a wide variety of non-reciprocal device architectures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05439v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Hyperfine-resolved optical spectroscopy of ultracold $^{87}$Rb$^{133}$Cs molecules: the $\mathrm{b}\,^3\Pi_0$ metastable state</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24660</link><description>arXiv:2510.24660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using an ultracold gas of $^{87}$Rb$^{133}$Cs molecules, we perform hyperfine-resolved spectroscopy of transitions from the vibronic ground state to the lowest rovibrational states of the electronic state $\mathrm{b}\,^3\Pi_0$, as a function of magnetic field. These transitions are spin forbidden, resulting in narrow linewidths, and feature near-diagonal Franck-Condon factors. We develop a model of the hyperfine and Zeeman structure that includes coupling between the $0^+$ and $0^-$ components of $\mathrm{b}\,^3\Pi_0$. We fit the spectra to obtain rotational and hyperfine coupling constants. We measure transition dipole moments associated with specific transitions by directly observing Rabi oscillations as a function of a resonant laser pulse duration. Using resonant $\pi$ pulses, we prepare molecules in the electronically excited state and directly measure the spontaneous emission rate.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.24660v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] The Avatar Cache: Enabling On-Demand Security with Morphable Cache Architecture</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06433</link><description>arXiv:2602.06433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sharing of the last-level cache (LLC) among multiple cores makes it vulnerable to cross-core conflict- and occupancy-based attacks. Despite extensive prior work, modern processors still employ non-secure set-associative LLCs. Existing secure LLC designs broadly fall into two categories: (i) randomized and (ii) partitioned. The state-of-the-art randomized design, Mirage, mitigates conflict-based attacks but incurs significant area overhead (20% additional storage) and design complexity. Partitioned LLCs mitigate both conflict- and occupancy-based attacks, but often suffer from large performance overheads (on average over 5% and up to 49%), require OS support in set-based schemes, or face scalability issues in way-based schemes. These factors pose major obstacles to the industrial adoption of secure LLCs. This paper asks whether strong LLC security can be achieved with minimal changes to a conventional set-associative LLC, enabling security only when needed while preserving low performance, power, and area overheads. We propose Avatar, a secure and morphable LLC that supports three modes: non-secure (Avatar-N), randomized secure (Avatar-R), and partitioned secure (Avatar-P), and can switch dynamically between them. Avatar closely resembles a conventional set-associative LLC, facilitating industrial adoption. Avatar-R introduces extra invalid entries and leverages high associativity to provide a strong security guarantee with little capacity loss, achieving only one set-associative eviction per $10^{30}$ years, while incurring 1.5% storage overhead, a 2.7% increase in static power, and a 0.2% slowdown over a 16~MB baseline. Avatar-P mitigates both conflict- and occupancy-based attacks with only a 3% performance overhead, substantially outperforming prior way-based partitioned LLCs. When security is unnecessary, Avatar switches to Avatar-N to maximize performance and energy efficiency.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06433v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] FeNN-DMA: A RISC-V SoC for SNN acceleration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00732</link><description>arXiv:2511.00732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a promising, energy-efficient alternative to standard Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and are particularly well-suited to spatio-temporal tasks such as keyword spotting and video classification. However, SNNs have a much lower arithmetic intensity than ANNs and are therefore not well-matched to standard accelerators like GPUs and TPUs. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are designed for such memory-bound workloads, and here we present a novel, fully-programmable RISC-V-based system-on-chip (FeNN-DMA), tailored to simulating SNNs on modern UltraScale+ FPGAs. We show that FeNN-DMA has comparable resource usage and energy requirements to state-of-the-art fixed-function SNN accelerators, yet it supports more complex neuron models and network topologies, and can simulate up to 16 thousand neurons and 256 million synapses per core. Using this functionality, we demonstrate state-of-the-art classification accuracy on the Spiking Heidelberg Digits, Neuromorphic MNIST and Braille tactile classification tasks.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.00732v2</guid></item><item><title>[Nature] How to stop the survey-taking AI chatbots that threaten to upend social science</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00386-2</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature, Published online: 09 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00386-2"&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-026-00386-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Researchers need new bot-detection strategies that exploit the limits of human reasoning rather than AI weaknesses.</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00386-2</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] When machine learning models learn chemistry II: applying WISP to real-world examples</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2026/DD/D5DD00399G</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/image/GA?id=D5DD00399G" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2026, Advance Article&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00399G, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Kerrin Janssen, Jan M.

This article introduces a mathematical model that captures these oscillations. It describes the formation and dissolution of an oxide layer, determining the oxide composition and the electrostatic potential perpendicular to the electrode. Oscillationsoccur if the following three conditions are met: the etching speed increases with defects in the oxide layer, the defect density decreases with increasing electric field at the Si-oxide interface,and a sufficient time delay exists between production and etching of the oxide.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00334-2?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Spin–orbit coupling signatures in polycrystalline bismuth thin films</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/6/063102/3378915/Spin-orbit-coupling-signatures-in-polycrystalline</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Bismuth is recognized as one of the elemental solids with the strongest intrinsic spin–orbit coupling (SOC) and is widely used to induce topological characteristics in hetero-structures, particularly in chalcogenide-based material systems. Precise control over the crystalline quality and phase purity of bismuth is crucial for its characteristic topological features which can be achieved via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). In this work, we investigate the electronic transport properties of MBE-grown Bi thin films deposited on Si(111) substrates. Robust spin–orbit coupling is manifested through pronounced weak anti-localization features observed under both out-of-plane and in-plane magnetic fields. In addition, a planar Hall response consistent with Rashba-type SOC emerges at room temperature, underscoring the strong interfacial and structural asymmetry in these MBE-grown Bi films. These films display a temperature-driven sign reversal in the Hall carrier concentration, indicating a transition in the dominant carrier type. Collectively, these observations advance the fundamental understanding of SOC-mediated transport in low-dimensional Bi and open avenues for engineering Rashba-dominated states in functional hetero-structures.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/6/063102/3378915/Spin-orbit-coupling-signatures-in-polycrystalline</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] High-order harmonics generation in MoS 2  nanosheets in the presence of CdSe and CdSe/V 2 O 5  quantum dots</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/6/061101/3378914/High-order-harmonics-generation-in-MoS2-nanosheets</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Engineering nonlinear optical responses in two-dimensional materials via heterostructure design is emerging as a powerful approach for next-generation photonic devices. Although perturbative nonlinear effects in these systems are well studied, their connection to nonperturbative processes such as high-harmonic generation (HHG) remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the HHG from few-layer MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets integrated with CdSe and passivated CdSe/V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; quantum dots (QDs). The hybrid structures exhibit pronounced enhancement in harmonic intensity and a clear extension of the harmonic cutoff relative to pristine MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. We demonstrate that interfacial charge-transfer dynamics—previously associated with the dominant contribution to the third-order susceptibility χ&lt;sup&gt;(3)&lt;/sup&gt;—also govern the efficiency of HHG, thereby establishing a direct link between perturbative and nonperturbative regimes in these 0D–2D hybrids. The carrier injection from the QDs increases the electron–hole population participating in HHG, while the moderated response in passivated QD systems highlights the role of interfacial potential barriers. These results provide a unified physical picture of nonlinear optical processes in hybrid nanostructures and offer design principles for enhancing coherent light generation.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/6/061101/3378914/High-order-harmonics-generation-in-MoS2-nanosheets</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Conductivity decay in freshly fabricated TFB films</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/6/061901/3378907/Conductivity-decay-in-freshly-fabricated-TFB-films</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Understanding the hole transport layers is fundamental to improve the stability of quantum-dot light-emitting diodes. This study investigates the short-term conductivity decay of freshly fabricated poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-co-N-(4-(3-methylpropyl))diphenylamine) (TFB) films under applied voltage. In addition, the conductivity decay of freshly prepared TFB films can be partially recovered after short-term storage. The phenomenon is also observed in other hole transporting materials, such as PVK and PF8Cz. The decay dynamics can be described using the Kohlrausch–Williams–Watts stretched-exponential function. The temperature-dependent relaxation time extracted from the decay curves obeys an Arrhenius law, yielding an activation energy of  0.18  ±  0.03 eV. This value is in good agreement with the calculated reorganization energy associated with the hopping transport of charge carriers. Based on the results, conductivity decay of freshly fabricated TFB films during the initial short-term period can be explained by the coupling between electric field-induced polarization and carrier transport (denoted as polarization–conduction coupling).&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/6/061901/3378907/Conductivity-decay-in-freshly-fabricated-TFB-films</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] In situ  analysis of SiO 2  films etched under cryogenic conditions using H 2 /F 2 /Ar gas mixture plasma</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/6/061602/3378902/In-situ-analysis-of-SiO2-films-etched-under</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;High aspect ratio hole etching processes require high-speed etching of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; films. Cryogenic etching significantly increases the etch rates of these two films by lowering the substrate temperature. However, the etching behavior and mechanisms in the temperature range below −70 °C remain unclear. In this work, we investigate the etching behavior of blanket SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; films, from 25 to −200 °C, and examine the mechanisms through &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;in situ&lt;/span&gt; analyses. Our results show that the etch rate at −100 °C is approximately 3.2 times higher than that at 25 °C, and is associated with the highest etching efficiency in our experiments. This enhancement in the etch rate is attributed to the co-adsorption of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and HF, which increases the number of etchants on the SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; surface. At temperatures lower than −100 °C, the solidification of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O reduces the co-adsorption of HF, decreasing the etch rate. At temperatures below −150 °C, the etch rate declines further, owing to the reduced volatility of the reaction product SiF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. These findings provide valuable insights for optimizing etching processes under cryogenic conditions.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/6/061602/3378902/In-situ-analysis-of-SiO2-films-etched-under</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Poset sensitivity analysis reveals post 2020 changes in human development index components</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00339-1?rss=yes</link><description>Data analysis; Social sciences; Research methodology social sciences</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00339-1?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Advances and perspectives in computer-assisted structure elucidation: a review</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2026/DD/D5DD00438A</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/image/GA?id=D5DD00438A" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2026, Advance Article&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00438A, Review Article&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dagny Aurich, Emma L.

Spatial analysis confirms co-localization of ZBED6 and PIK3C3 in tumor tissues. Using genes associated with this axis, we develop a six-gene prognostic signature that stratifies patients with distinct survival outcomes and differential responses to immunotherapy and targeted therapy.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00327-5?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Photoredox Unmasking of Aromatic C–H Bonds in Living Environments Enabled by Thianthrenium Salts</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.6c00530</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.6c00530/asset/images/medium/ja6c00530_0007.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.6c00530&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 15:30:50 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.6c00530</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Single-Channel Saturation at the Quantum Conductance Limit in Single-Molecule Junctions</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c18067</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c18067/asset/images/medium/ja5c18067_0006.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c18067&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 15:29:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c18067</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Development of Substrate-Directed Activity-Based Probes via Disulfide-Trapping for Site-Specific Interrogation of Nucleosomal Deubiquitination</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c20156</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c20156/asset/images/medium/ja5c20156_0008.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c20156&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 14:33:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c20156</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Managing Active Hydrogen Species on Ternary Copper-Based Catalyst for Efficient Electrochemical Ammonia Synthesis from Nitrate</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c21149</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c21149/asset/images/medium/ja5c21149_0006.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c21149&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 14:32:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c21149</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Spin-Conserved Hot Charge Transfer Exciton Formation and Cooling at the Two-Dimensional Semiconductor Interface</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c20527</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c20527/asset/images/medium/ja5c20527_0006.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c20527&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 14:31:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c20527</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Hepatocytes functionally reprogrammed by KIAA1199-high colorectal cancer cells favour the accumulation of pro-metastatic Egr1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neutrophils</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69250-1</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 07 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69250-1"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-69250-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;KIAA1199 is upregulated in colorectal cancer (CRC), associated with metastasis and poor clinical outcomes.

Hardware-Accelerated ASIC and Cardiac Monitoring System for Wearable Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11373588</link><description>Cardiac arrhythmia is a common and potentially life-threatening cardiovascular disorder, requiring timely and accurate detection. This article presents an ultralow-power application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for real-time multiclass arrhythmia classification in wearable electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring. Unlike present works that require high computational resources or use limited resources for binary or small-category classification, this work proposes a hardware-friendly ASIC to support seven categories of cardiac arrhythmia classification based on the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard, outperforming most existing chips. Through a shared discrete wavelet transform (DWT) module and an optimized support vector machine (SVM) core, the hardware resources are reduced by over 30% for the optimized SVM and by over 75% when both optimizations are applied together. Through optimized circuit design and low-power design, this ASIC can maintain a high accuracy of 97.2% and an ultralow power consumption of 35.5 nJ/inference, which is lower than most of the existing tasks. This work uses an efficient hardware design to reduce the hardware complexity, making it suitable for wearable devices that require low power consumption.

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been considered as a next-generation disruptive photovoltaic technology, yet their advancement is constrained by the complexity of perovskite recipe with high-dimensional material and process design space. Despite the impressive general reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs), they struggle with two limitations for application in PSCs: an inability to align general semantics with the perovskite domain knowledge, and an inefficiency in navigating high-dimensional perovskite material and recipe design spaces. To address these limitations, we introduce a domain-knowledge-guided framework PVK-LLM, a specialized model to serve as an expert to bridge general semantics with perovskite domain knowledge. By integrating this domain knowledge into a hierarchical Bayesian Optimization workflow, our approach efficiently navigates the high-dimension design space on a solar cell simulator platform. The domain knowledge resolves cold-start problems while dynamically adapting to simulator feedback. Moreover, in an individual wet-lab experiment aimed at maximizing power conversion efficiency (PCE), our framework autonomously proposes a novel synergistic four-component recipe comprising specialized organic passivation recipe (3MTPAI, PDAI2, EDAI2, and PipDI) which has not been reported in existing literature. This AI-designed recipe effectively achieves a champion PCE value of over 26.0 %, approaching world records achieved through extensive expert trial-and-error. Our approach can effectively enable LLM comprehend the domain knowledge, which can efficiently navigate in a high-dimensional, capable to accelerate the advancement in real-world perovskite as well as other material science development.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04914v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Constraints on stability and renormalization group flows in nonequilibrium matter</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04961</link><description>arXiv:2602.04961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive constraints on renormalization group (RG) flows and stability of phases in nonequilibrium systems using quantum information inequalities. These constraints involve conditional mutual information (CMI), which quantifies correlations between spatially separated regions not mediated by their surroundings. First, assuming CMI is UV finite, we show that the scaling function associated with CMI is monotonic along the RG flow. This implies a non-perturbative stability criterion: a fixed point with smaller CMI cannot be destabilized toward one with larger CMI. Second, we bound the CMI of a convex mixture of states in terms of the CMI of individual components. We use this inequality to infer perturbative stability of spontaneous symmetry breaking states against quantum channels that explicitly break symmetry. We illustrate these constraints through several examples, including decoherence-driven transitions in classical symmetry-broken states, strong-to-weak symmetry breaking criticality in two dimensions, and even transitions in pure quantum states. We also discuss implications for classical nonequilibrium steady states.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04961v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Josephson Dynamics of 2D Bose-Einstein Condensates in Dual-Core Trap: Homogeneous, Droplet-Droplet, and Vortex-Vortex Regimes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05001</link><description>arXiv:2602.05001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of a two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate mixture, loaded into a dual-core trap, when beyond-mean-field effects are taken into account, are considered. The effects of quantum fluctuations are described by the Lee-Huang-Yang correction terms in the extended coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations. The spatially uniform and inhomogeneous BEC cases are studied. In the first case, the parameter regimes associated with macroscopic quantum tunnelling, self-trapping, and revival-like localisation dynamics are found. The Josephson oscillation frequencies for both the zero-phase and the $\pi$-phase modes are derived. As the total atom number varies, the dynamics exhibit a nontrivial bifurcation structure: along the zero-phase branch, two pitchfork bifurcations generate bistability and hysteresis, while the $\pi$-phase branch shows a single pitchfork bifurcation. In the second case, the Josephson dynamics for quantum droplets and vortices are investigated. Predictions for the oscillation frequencies of the atomic population between quantum droplets are obtained and fully validated by direct numerical simulations of coupled extended GP equations. The existence of the Andreev-Bashkin nondissipative drag through simulations of droplet-droplet interactions is shown. The Josephson dynamics of vortex states are studied. Vortices with topological charge $S$ and sufficiently small particle number are typically unstable, breaking up into $S+1$ (occasionally $S+2$) fundamental fragments, with the breakup time increasing as the particle number grows. Unstable asymmetric vortices show splitting and/or crescent-like instability. For vortices with sufficiently large norms, long-time simulations confirm robust stability against small perturbations; in this regime, Josephson oscillations and Andreev-Bashkin-type entrainment for vortex states with charges $S=1, 2$, and $3$ are investigated.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05001v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Strong radial electric field scaling near nanoscale conductive filaments and the ReRAM resistive switching mechanism</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05067</link><description>arXiv:2602.05067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics underlying reset in bipolar resistive memory has been the subject of decades of controversy and has been identified as the primary barrier to resistive memory technology development. This manuscript introduces a nanoscale effect in current carrying conductors, whereby surface charge induced radial electric fields are found to be inversely proportional to the radius of the conductive path. This nanoscale effect is then applied to explain the negative resistance switching (reset) mechanism in filamentary metal oxide resistive switching memory devices (memristors). Previous explanations for the negative resistive switching mechanism state that diffusion constitutes the radial driving mechanism for oxygen ions, and drift under electric fields is restricted to the direction parallel to current flow. This explanation conflicts with retention and microscopy data collected in a subset of devices presented in literature. We demonstrate that the electric field's dependency on the on the radius of a nanoscale conductive path can result in radial fields on the order of 10^5 to 10^6 V/cm at only -1 V bias, sufficient to govern the negative resistance switching mechanism in filamentary metal oxides. By accounting for this nanoscale size effect, long standing anomalous experimental data about the negative (reset) resistance switching mechanism in bipolar filamentary resistive memory devices is finally reconciled. Wide understanding of surface charges and associated electric fields in nanoscale conductive paths could prove important for further scaling of integrated circuits and aid in elucidating many nanoscale phenomena.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05067v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spin current generation via magnetic skyrmion, bimeron, and meron crystals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05332</link><description>arXiv:2602.05332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin current offers a promising route toward energy-efficient and high-speed information processing. Developing efficient methods for their generation remains a central challenge in spintronics. Here, we investigate spin current generation via two-dimensional topological spin textures: a skyrmion crystal (SkX) with out-of-plane magnetization, a bimeron crystal (BmX) with in-plane magnetization, and a meron crystal (MX) with zero net magnetization. We show that these distinct spin textures generate spin currents with characteristic spin polarization directions. In the absence of spin--orbit coupling, the SkX and BmX generate spin currents polarized along their magnetization directions, whereas the MX yields no spin current. Upon introducing spin--orbit coupling, while the behavior of the SkX does not qualitatively change, the BmX generates nonzero spin currents in multiple polarization directions. Notably, the MX, despite its zero net magnetization, exhibits a pronounced spin current with out-of-plane spin polarization, driven by an enhanced spin Berry curvature associated with characteristic band degeneracy. We further demonstrate that the electronic and spin transport properties of each texture are governed by their magnetic symmetries. Our results highlight the topological spin textures as efficient sources of spin current even without net magnetization, expanding the design for spintronics devices based on topological magnetic metals.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05332v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] First-principles study of photovoltaic and thermoelectric properties of AgBiSCl2</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05355</link><description>arXiv:2602.05355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work systematically investigates the potential of the hybrid anion semiconductor AgBiSCl2 for photovoltaic and thermoelectric applications, aiming to provide theoretical guidance for high-performance energy conversion devices. Structural analysis reveals favorable ductility and a relatively low Debye temperature. Analysis of interatomic interactions indicates that Ag-S and Ag-Cl bonds are relatively weak, resulting in local structural softness and enhanced lattice anharmonicity. These weak bonds facilitate phonon scattering and give rise to low-frequency localized rattling vibrations primarily associated with Ag atoms, contributing to reduced lattice thermal conductivity. In contrast, Bi-S bonds exhibit stronger, directional interactions, which help stabilize the overall structure. The coexistence of weak bonding and strong lattice coupling enables favorable modulation of thermal transport properties.Optically, AgBiSCl2 possesses a high static dielectric constant and exhibits strong absorption in the ultraviolet region. In terms of thermal transport, phonon spectrum exhibit mode hardening with temperature increasing. The localized Ag vibrations intensify the anharmonicity, reducing phonon lifetimes and group velocities.For electronic transport, the p-type material maintains a higher Seebeck coefficient than the n-type, while the latter shows greater electrical conductivity. At 700 K, the figure of merit reaches 0.77 for p-type and 0.69 for n-type AgBiSCl2, indicating promising high-temperature thermoelectric performance.In summary, AgBiSCl2 exhibits excellent potential for dual photovoltaic and thermoelectric applications. Its unique bonding features and lattice response mechanisms offer valuable insights into designing multifunctional energy conversion materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05355v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Compact self-matched gyrators using edge magnetoplasmons</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05439</link><description>arXiv:2602.05439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal microwave components are indispensable in quantum information processing and cryogenic measurement. Conventional implementations, however, are bulky and incompatible with on-chip scalable integration. Recent efforts to develop compact on-chip alternatives often rely on active modulation or complex circuit architectures, which introduce additional losses and degrade performance. We demonstrate the realization of compact, self-impedance-matched gyrators based on edge magnetoplasmons in a two-dimensional electron gas. Gyrators can be used as building blocks for other non-reciprocal elements such as isolators and circulators. Our devices achieve gyration from 0.2 to 2 GHz, tunable by moderate out-of plane magnetic fields below 400 mT, and sub-mm footprint, two orders of magnitude smaller than conventional ferrite-based components. Using an electrode geometry predicted to minimize reflections, we achieve insertion losses as low as 2 to 4 dB. The self-matched design framework we utilize is broadly applicable, and can be implemented in a wide variety of non-reciprocal device architectures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05439v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Reducing the Computational Cost Scaling of Tensor Network Algorithms via Field-Programmable Gate Array Parallelism</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05900</link><description>arXiv:2602.05900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving the computational efficiency of quantum many-body calculations from a hardware perspective remains a critical challenge. Although field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have recently been exploited to improve the computational scaling of algorithms such as Monte Carlo methods, their application to tensor network algorithms is still at an early stage. In this work, we propose a fine-grained parallel tensor network design based on FPGAs to substantially enhance the computational efficiency of two representative tensor network algorithms: the infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD) and the higher-order tensor renormalization group (HOTRG). By employing a quad-tile partitioning strategy to decompose tensor elements and map them onto hardware circuits, our approach effectively translates algorithmic computational complexity into scalable hardware resource utilization, enabling an extremely high degree of parallelism on FPGAs. Compared with conventional CPU-based implementations, our scheme exhibits superior scalability in computation time, reducing the bond-dimension scaling of the computational cost from $O(D_b^3)$ to $O(D_b)$ for iTEBD and from $O(D_b^6)$ to $O(D_b^2)$ for HOTRG. This work provides a theoretical foundation for future hardware implementations of large-scale tensor network computations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05900v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spontaneous Parity Breaking in Quantum Antiferromagnets on the Triangular Lattice</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05901</link><description>arXiv:2602.05901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frustration on the triangular lattice has long been a source of intriguing and often debated phases in many-body systems. Although symmetry analysis has been employed, the role of the seemingly trivial parity symmetry has received little attention. In this work, we show that phases induced by frustration are systematically shaped by an implicit rule of thumb associated with spontaneous parity breaking. This principle enables us to anticipate and rationalize the regimes and conditions under which nontrivial phases emerge. For the spin-$S$ antiferromagnetic XXZ model, we demonstrate that a controversial parity-broken phase appears only at intermediate values of $S$. In bilayer systems, enhanced frustration leads to additional phases, such as supersolids, whose properties can be classified by their characteristic parity features. Benefiting from our improved tensor network contraction techniques, we confirm these results through large-scale tensor-network calculations. This study offers an alternative viewpoint and a systematic approach for examining the interplay between spin, symmetry, and frustration in many-body systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05901v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Tunable multi-magnon Floquet topological edge states</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20049</link><description>arXiv:2508.20049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that periodically time-modulating the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in a two-dimensional magnon insulator may induce a topological phase transition that results in the presence of robust edge modes. To this end, we study a square lattice of spins interacting via an XXZ Heisenberg model with a ferromagnetic longitudinal coupling and antiferromagnetic transverse coupling, as well as the aforementioned time-modulated DMI. The topologically protected edge states of this system are composed of coherent superpositions of single-magnon excitations and two magnon bound states. Furthermore, we show that the chirality of the edge states can be controlled by adjusting the relative phase for the drive on the DMI associated with nearest neighbors in the x and y directions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.20049v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Shape-specific fluctuations of an active colloidal interface</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08567</link><description>arXiv:2509.08567v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by a recently synthesizable class of active interfaces formed by linked self--propelled colloids, we investigate the dynamics and fluctuations of a phoretically (chemically) interacting active interface with roto--translational coupling. We enumerate all steady--state shapes of the interface across parameter space and identify a regime where the interface acquires a finite curvature, leading to a characteristic ''C--shaped'' topology, along with persistent self--propulsion. In this phase, the interface height fluctuations obey Family--Vicsek scaling but with novel exponents: a dynamic exponent $z_h \approx 0.5$, a roughness exponent $\alpha_h \approx 0.9$ and a super--ballistic growth exponent $\beta_h \approx 1.7$. In contrast, the orientational fluctuations of the colloidal monomers exhibit a negative roughness exponent, reflecting a surprising smoothness law, where steady--state fluctuations diminish with increasing system size. Together, these findings point towards a unique non--equilibrium universality class associated with self--propelled interfaces of non--standard shape.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.08567v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Average density of Bloch electrons in a homogeneous magnetic field: A second-order response</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08761</link><description>arXiv:2511.08761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the average density of a three-dimensional multiband crystal of arbitrary symmetry, metal or insulator, to first and second order in a weak homogeneous magnetic field. To linear order and for insulators, the density follows the well-known Streda formula, but for metals there is an extra contribution from the orbital magnetic moments at the Fermi surface. To second order the average density depends on several microscopic processes. Among these, the quantum metric tensor plays an important role by generating a pseudo-magnetic moment resulting from the rotation of the Bloch wave functions in the complex projective plane. We also discuss the implications of our results for the volume and pressure. The method we develop is explicitly gauge invariant, considers intraband and interband processes on equal footing, accommodates relaxation processes, and can be readily extended to other observables.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.08761v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Ion Jump Motion as the Background for Muon Diffusion in Battery Materials Research Using $\mu$SR</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21013</link><description>arXiv:2511.21013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) in ion diffusion were performed using the {\sl extended} Kubo-Toyabe (KT) relaxation function $G_z^{\rm EA}(t)$ that incorporates an Edwards-Anderson type autocorrelation function for the jump motion of ions. The analysis of the generated $\mu$SR spectra using the conventional KT function $G_z^{\rm KT}(t;\Delta_{\rm KT},\nu_{\rm KT})$ (mimicking the previous analysis procedure) suggest that the anomalous peak in the fluctuation rate $\nu_{\rm KT}$ around a specific temperature $T^*$ and associated decrease of the linewidth $\Delta_{\rm KT}$ above $T^*$, often observed in the previous $\mu$SR studies on ion diffusion, originate from the sharp increase in the ion jump rate $\nu_{\rm i}$ against that of the muon $\nu_\mu$ with increasing temperature. This indicates that a more detailed reanalysis of the vintage data using $G_z^{\rm EA}(t)$ is useful for the proper evaluation of $\nu_{\rm i}$ and $\nu_\mu$. Meanwhile, it also suggests that the $\mu$SR results showing no such anomaly convey little information on ion diffusion.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.21013v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Topological hybridisation of plasmons with ferrimagnetic magnons</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18995</link><description>arXiv:2601.18995v3 Announce Type: replace

Using a combined microscopic-macroscopic framework for plasmon-magnon coupling, we show that plasmons and magnons strongly hybridize over both GHz and THz frequency ranges, enabling experimental access well above cryogenic temperatures. Moreover, the developed approach provides an efficient and natural classification of the topology of the hybrid modes, rooted in the phase winding of the plasmon-magnon coupling induced by spin-momentum locking and the associated chiral winding of the electronic spin along the Fermi contours. Finally, we identify experimentally accessible manifestations of the hybridization, such as topological interface modes and an anomalous thermal Hall response.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18995v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dynamics of string breaking and revival in a Rydberg atomic chain</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04141</link><description>arXiv:2602.04141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: String breaking is one of the most representative non-perturbative dynamics processes in confinement theory, typically associated with the creation of particle-antiparticle pairs. In this paper, we take a one-dimensional Rydberg atomic chain to theoretically study the dynamical of finite-length string state. Under different string tension conditions, we find that the string dynamics exhibits two clearly distinguishable evolution characteristics: one is that the string breaks and the system enters a superposition state space containing multiple meson state configurations; the other is localized string dynamics, in which the string undergoes local breaking but can then recombine and return to a state close to the initial structure, with the breaking and recombination processes recurring over a long time scale. Through the analysis of the evolution of different meson state configurations, we visually depict the redistribution of configuration weights during the string breaking process, and reveal the observable recovery characteristics of the string after breaking. Further analysis shows that the enhancement of quantum fluctuations can increase the weight of the double-meson state configurations in the system wave function without changing the dominant dynamical behavior. The above results present a rich picture of string breaking dynamics in a one-dimensional Rydberg atomic chain and provide insights for studying confinement physics and related gauge field theory phenomena on quantum simulation platforms.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04141v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Recovery dynamics of a gap-engineered transmon after a quasiparticle burst</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08104</link><description>arXiv:2505.08104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ionizing radiation impacts create bursts of quasiparticle density in superconducting qubits. These bursts temporarily degrade qubit coherence which can be detrimental for quantum error correction. Here, we experimentally resolve quasiparticle bursts in 3D gap-engineered transmon qubits by continuously monitoring qubit transitions. Gap engineering allows us to reduce the burst detection rate by a factor of five. This reduction falls four orders of magnitude short of that expected if the quasiparticles were to quickly thermalize to the cryostat temperature. We associate the limited effect of gap engineering with the slow thermalization of the phonons in our chips after the burst.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.08104v3</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] System-Level Isolation for Mixed-Criticality RISC-V SoCs: A "World" Reality Check</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05002</link><description>arXiv:2602.05002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As RISC-V adoption accelerates, domains such as automotive, the Internet of Things (IoT), and industrial control are attracting growing attention. These domains are subject to stringent Size, Weight, Power, and Cost (SWaP-C) constraints, which have driven a shift toward heterogeneous Systems-on-Chip (SoCs) integrating general-purpose CPUs, tightly coupled accelerators, and diverse I/O devices with different integrity levels. While such integration improves cost efficiency and performance, it introduces a fundamental safety and security challenge: enforcing system-level isolation in mixed-criticality environments. Although RISC-V International has proposed several hardware isolation primitives, including RISC-V Worlds, IOPMP, and SmMTT, their interoperability, scalability, and suitability for real-time systems remain insufficiently understood. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of these primitives from the perspective of practical heterogeneous SoC designs. We implement an IOPMP, a World-based checker, and a modified RISC-V World checker that addresses key limitations of the baseline specification, and evaluate their trade-offs in terms of security guarantees and power-performance-area (PPA). Our results show that the World-based checker introduces a fixed, configuration-independent access latency, achieving lower worst-case delay than the evaluated alternatives while scaling predictably with system size. At the macro level, we estimate that the proposed modifications reduce SoC area by up to approximately 5% compared to a baseline design. All artifacts will be released as open source, and we expect these findings to directly contribute to the evolution and ratification of RISC-V specifications, as well as to the design of future RISC-V SoCs.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05002v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] CGRA4ML: A Hardware/Software Framework to Implement Neural Networks for Scientific Edge Computing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15561</link><description>arXiv:2408.15561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scientific community increasingly relies on machine learning (ML) for near-sensor processing, leveraging its strengths in tasks such as pattern recognition, anomaly detection, and real-time decision-making. These deployments demand accelerators that combine extremely high performance with programmability, ease of integration, and straightforward verification. We present cgra4ml, an open-source, modular framework that generates parameterizable CGRA accelerators in synthesizable SystemVerilog RTL, tailored to common ML compute patterns found in scientific applications. The framework supports seamless system integration through AXI-compliant interfaces and open-source DMA components, and it includes automatic firmware generation for programming the accelerator. A comprehensive verification suite and a runtime firmware stack further support deployment across diverse SoC platforms. cgra4ml provides a modular, full-stack infrastructure, including a Python API, SystemVerilog hardware, TCL toolflows, and a C runtime, which facilitates easy integration and experimentation, allowing scientists to focus on innovation rather than dealing with the intricacies of hardware design and optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of cgra4ml to implement common scientific edge neural networks using ASIC and FPGA design flows.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2408.15561v3</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

From 4 microarray datasets (n=859) and a large OC cohort (n=1793), we identified 87 overall survival (OS) and/or progression-free survival (PFS)-associated genes. Multigene models revealed that 25 combinations and 5 combinations were predicted at least 5-year OS and 5-year PFS, respectively. Notably, compared with all combinations of 4 randomly selected genes, combinations involving ALDH1A2, DCN, GATA6, and PDGFRA were frequent among the top 20 OS models; 6 combinations predicted at least 50-month OS, and tissue microarray (155 OC samples) analyses confirmed this.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00307-X?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Interferon Signaling Gene Expression and DNA Methylation Interactions in Sjögren's Disease via Mendelian Randomization</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00325-1?rss=yes</link><description>Sjögren's disease (SD) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by dysregulated interferon (IFN) signaling, but the causal genes and regulatory mechanisms remain unclear.

Abstract: Understanding defects in atomically thin van der Waals (vdW) semiconductors is essential for advancing their use in next-generation optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices. Here, we apply a combination of various impedance spectroscopy techniques to two-dimensional (2D) vdW GaSe doped with silicon (Si) to reconstruct deep trap states across the full bandgap. Deep-level transient spectroscopy reveals three distinct deep states 0.31, 0.88, and 1.40 eV below the conduction band edge. Complementary deep-level optical spectroscopy and photocapacitance measurements identify three deep states at 1.4 and 1.8 eV below the conduction band edge, and 2.0 eV above the valence band edge, with thermal admittance spectroscopy providing additional verification and further resolving two trap states, at 0.16 eV above the valence band edge and at 0.26 eV below the conduction band edge. By comparing the experimentally extracted ionization energies with the predictions of density functional theory, our results attribute these trap states primarily to Si-related defects and metal vacancies. This work presents a comprehensive defect map of Si-doped GaSe, providing critical insights into carrier trapping mechanisms that are essential for optimizing the design of 2D material-based devices for industrial applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03964v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dynamics of string breaking and revival in a Rydberg atomic chain</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04141</link><description>arXiv:2602.04141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: String breaking is one of the most representative nonperturbative dynamics processes in confinement theory, typically associated with the creation of particle-antiparticle pairs. In this paper, we take a one-dimensional Rydberg atomic chain to theoretically study the dynamical of finite-length string state. Under different string tension conditions, we find that the string dynamics exhibits two clearly distinguishable evolution characteristics: one is that the string breaks and the system enters a superposition state space containing multiple meson state configurations; the other is localized string dynamics, in which the string undergoes local breaking but can then recombine and return to a state close to the initial structure, with the breaking and recombination processes recurring over a long time scale. Through the analysis of the evolution of different meson state configurations, we visually depict the redistribution of configuration weights during the string breaking process, and reveal the observable recovery characteristics of the string after breaking. Further analysis shows that the enhancement of quantum fluctuations can increase the weight of the double-meson state configurations in the system wave function without changing the dominant dynamical behavior. The above results present a rich picture of string breaking dynamics in a one-dimensional Rydberg atomic chain and provide insights for studying confinement physics and related gauge field theory phenomena on quantum simulation platforms.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04141v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Restoring Sparsity in Potts Machines via Mean-Field Constraints</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04200</link><description>arXiv:2602.04200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ising machines and related probabilistic hardware have emerged as promising platforms for NP-hard optimization and sampling. However, many practical problems involve constraints that induce dense or all-to-all couplings, undermining scalability and hardware efficiency. We address this constraint-induced density through two complementary approaches. First, we introduce a hardware-aware native formulation for multi-state probabilistic digits (p-dits) that avoids the locally dense intra-variable couplings required by binary Ising encodings. We validate p-dit dynamics by reproducing known critical behavior of the 2D Potts model. Second, we propose mean-field constraints (MFC), a hybrid scheme that replaces dense pairwise constraint couplings with dynamically updated single-node biases. Applied to balanced graph partitioning, MFC achieves solution quality comparable to exact all-to-all constraint formulations while dramatically reducing graph density. Finally, we demonstrate the practical impact of restored sparsity by an FPGA implementation, enabling orders-of-magnitude acceleration over CPU-based solvers. Together, these results outline a pathway for scaling constrained optimization on probabilistic hardware.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04200v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Piezomagnetic transport in van der Waals noncoplanar Antiferromagnets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04245</link><description>arXiv:2602.04245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The piezomagnetic effect-strain-induced linear modulation of magnetization, arises in magnets with broken time-reversal symmetry (BTRS), offering a pathway to bidirectional strain-based control of magnetism, which is an essential straintronic and spintronic functionality in solids. Metallic antiferromagnets with BTRS provide an ideal platform to study this effect through transport measurements, yet experimental demonstrations are limited. Van der Waals (vdW) nanomagnets, with their mechanical flexibility, are particularly promising for realizing large piezomagnetic responses and effective transport control. Here we demonstrate piezomagnetic control of electronic transport in nano-devices of the vdW antiferromagnets CoNb$_3$S$_6$ and CoTa$_3$S$_6$, archetypal vdW metals with BTRS that exhibit a spontaneous Hall effect. Applying uniaxial strain linearly modulates both the antiferromagnetic transition temperature and coercive field, consistent with strain-driven tuning of exchange coupling, key signatures of the piezomagnetic effect. Moreover, spontaneous Hall effect is controllable via strain, evidencing piezomagnetic tuning of Berry curvature and its associated geometric transport. These findings establish piezomagnetism as a powerful route to manipulate antiferromagnetic transport, opening avenues for straintronic and spintronic applications in vdW magnetic systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04245v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Revealing the interfacial kinetic mechanisms in high-entropy doped Na$_3$V$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ through electrochemical investigation and distribution of relaxation times</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04372</link><description>arXiv:2602.04372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We designed a high-entropy doped NASICON cathode, Na$_3$V$_{1.9}$(CrMoAlZrNi)$_{0.1}$(PO$_4$)$_3$ and investigate its electrochemical performance for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) to understand the diffusion mechanism including distribution of relaxation times analysis of interfacial kinetics. This trace doping induces high-entropy mixing at the vanadium site, tuning the lattice and enhancing specific capacity, activating V$^{4+}$/V$^{5+}$ redox couple 3.95~V. Interestingly, it delivers a reversible capacity of 119~mAh~g$^{-1}$ at 0.1~C, and demonstrate excellent stability of 68\% after 1000 cycles at 10~C. The calculated diffusion coefficient values are found within the range of \(10^{-11}\)--\(10^{-13}~\mathrm{cm^2\,s^{-1}}\). The systematic investigation of temperature and voltage-dependent impedance data using the distribution of relaxation times provides deeper insights into the underlying charge-transfer and transport processes. The full cells with hard carbon delivers 326~Wh~kg$^{-1}$ (with respect to cathode mass) at $\approx$3.2~V and retained $\sim$79\% capacity after 100 cycles at 2~C. Our study opens new avenues for developing high-entropy doped cathodes for enhanced structural stability, extended redox activity, and optimized electrochemical kinetics for practical implementation of SIBs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04372v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Transport Properties of Active Particles Moving on Adjustable Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04732</link><description>arXiv:2602.04732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active adaptive matter has attracted considerable interest due to its rich, largely unexplained dynamics and its relevance to a wide range of synthetic and biological materials. An important subclass of such systems consists of active particles that can remodel the network in which they move. Here, we introduce a minimal yet versatile model of active particles moving on an adjustable network. In this model, particles undergo discrete run-and-tumble motion along the links of a triangular lattice and leave behind a trail of temporarily blocked links. These closed links cannot be traversed by other particles and reopen only after a characteristic healing time. The resulting trail-mediated blocking mechanism is fundamentally distinct from more familiar interactions such as excluded-volume effects. In the high-persistence limit, we find a qualitative contrast between the two mechanisms: while steric blocking leads to reduced diffusivity with increasing persistence, trail-induced blocking causes diffusivity to increase monotonically. We characterize this fundamental difference and the associated, unexpected transport properties, and discuss potential applications of our findings.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04732v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dimensional crossover of bound complexes in a two-species Bose-Hubbard lattice: correlations and dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04741</link><description>arXiv:2602.04741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the equilibrium and nonequilibrium formation of four-particle complexes in a balanced two-species Bose-Hubbard model with repulsive intra- and attractive inter-species interactions. Using exact diagonalization, we characterize the transition from weakly- to strongly-correlated dimer and tetramer states along the one- to two-dimensional crossover in coupled-chain geometries by combining local correlation signatures with global diagnostics such as the binding energy and interspecies entanglement entropy. We show that transverse connectivity between chains qualitatively reshapes the phase diagram, substantially enlarging the tetramer region and, in particular, stabilizing weakly bound tetramers when compared to the one-dimensional chains. By tuning the interchain hopping, we identify a transition from a degenerate manifold of spatially separated dimers to a localized tetramer ground state, driven by the lifting of one-dimensional configurational degeneracies and an associated kinetic-energy gain. Finally, we demonstrate interaction and geometric quench protocols to dynamically prepare these complexes with high fidelity. Our results provide a microscopic framework for engineering and probing few-body bosonic bound states in tunable lattice geometries.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04741v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A brief review of evolutionary game dynamics in the reinforcement learning paradigm</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04150</link><description>arXiv:2602.04150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperation, fairness, trust, and resource coordination are cornerstones of modern civilization, yet their emergence remains inadequately explained by the persistent discrepancies between theoretical predictions and behavioral experiments. Part of this gap may arise from the imitation learning paradigm commonly used in prior theoretical models, which assumes individuals merely copy successful neighbors according to predetermined, fixed rules. This review examines recent advances in evolutionary game dynamics that employ reinforcement learning (RL) as an alternative paradigm. In RL, individuals learn through trial and error and introspectively refine their strategies based on environmental feedback. We begin by introducing key concepts in evolutionary game theory and the two learning paradigms, then synthesize progress in applying RL to elucidate cooperation, trust, fairness, optimal resource coordination, and ecological dynamics. Collectively, these studies indicate that RL offers a promising unified framework for understanding the diverse social and ecological phenomena observed in human and natural systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04150v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Theory of Speciation Transitions in Diffusion Models with General Class Structure</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04404</link><description>arXiv:2602.04404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Models generate data by reversing a stochastic diffusion process, progressively transforming noise into structured samples drawn from a target distribution. Recent theoretical work has shown that this backward dynamics can undergo sharp qualitative transitions, known as speciation transitions, during which trajectories become dynamically committed to data classes. Existing theoretical analyses, however, are limited to settings where classes are identifiable through first moments, such as mixtures of Gaussians with well-separated means. In this work, we develop a general theory of speciation in diffusion models that applies to arbitrary target distributions admitting well-defined classes. We formalize the notion of class structure through Bayes classification and characterize speciation times in terms of free-entropy difference between classes. This criterion recovers known results in previously studied Gaussian-mixture models, while extending to situations in which classes are not distinguishable by first moments and may instead differ through higher-order or collective features. Our framework also accommodates multiple classes and predicts the existence of successive speciation times associated with increasingly fine-grained class commitment. We illustrate the theory on two analytically tractable examples: mixtures of one-dimensional Ising models at different temperatures and mixtures of zero-mean Gaussians with distinct covariance structures. In the Ising case, we obtain explicit expressions for speciation times by mapping the problem onto a random-field Ising model and solving it via the replica method. Our results provide a unified and broadly applicable description of speciation transitions in diffusion-based generative models.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04404v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions in Boundary Time Crystals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04792</link><description>arXiv:2602.04792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of a dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) in a dissipative collective-spin model that exhibits the boundary time crystal (BTC) phase. We initialize the system in the ground state of the Hamiltonian in either the BTC or the non-BTC phase, and drive it across the BTC transition. The driving is done by an abrupt quench or by a finite-time linear ramp of a Hamiltonian control parameter under Markovian Lindblad dynamics. We diagnose DQPTs through zeros of the fidelity-based Loschmidt echo between the initial state and the evolving mixed state, which induce nonanalytic cusp-like features in the associated rate function. For quenches into the BTC phase, the Loschmidt echo exhibits repeated zeros due to the emergent time-periodic steady state, whereas for quenches into the non-BTC phase, the overlap vanishes and remains zero once the dynamics relaxes to a stationary state. We further show that the DQPT persists under the ramp protocol followed by unitary evolution with the final Hamiltonian. Finally, we analyze the finite-size scaling of the first critical time and find convergence to a constant in the thermodynamic limit, with distinct power-law approaches for the quench and the ramp protocols.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04792v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spin-momentum Locking and Topological Vector Charge Response with Conserved Spin</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03301</link><description>arXiv:2304.03301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-momentum locking plays a fundamental role in spintronics and, more broadly, is an important concept in condensed matter physics. In 2D and 3D, spin-momentum locking typically does not allow spin-conservation because the spin-1/2 operators of electrons anticommute. Instead, here we study spin-momentum locking terms with conserved, commuting pseudospins built from a combination of spin and orbitals. We find that 2D spin-momentum locking terms with conserved pseudospins generally lead to linearly dispersing modes at low-energy with anomalous charge and pseudospin currents. To cure the anomaly we show that such anomalous modes can be realized on the surface of a 3D Weyl semimetal (or an associated weak topological insulator) with a nonzero mixed spin-momentum quadrupole moment, which is determined by the momentum location and pseudospin eigenvalues of Weyl points at the Fermi level. Crucially, this mixed quadrupole moment captures a mixed pseudospin-charge bulk response that cancels the anomaly of surface modes, and can generate a giant 3D spin Hall effect, among other phenomena.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2304.03301v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Deterministic scale-invariant dynamics in a logistic Game-of-Life model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07189</link><description>arXiv:2411.07189v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scale invariance is a hallmark of criticality in complex dynamical systems. While random external inputs or tunable stochastic interactions are typically required to produce critical behavior, it remains unclear whether scale-invariant dynamics can emerge from purely deterministic interactions. Here, we address this question by studying the asymptotic dynamics of the logistic Game of Life (GOL), a deterministic-parameter extension of Conway's GOL. In this system, we identify three distinct asymptotic phases separated by two fundamentally different critical points. The first critical point, associated with an unusual form of self-organized criticality, separates a sparse-static phase from a sparse-dynamic phase. The second critical point corresponds to a deterministic percolation transition between the sparse-dynamic phase and a third, dense-dynamic phase. In addition, we observe power-law cluster size distributions with unconventional critical exponents not found in standard equilibrium systems. Overall, our work paves the way for studying emergent scale invariance in purely deterministic systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.07189v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interplay of localization and topology in disordered dimerized array of Rydberg atoms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07720</link><description>arXiv:2505.07720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg tweezer arrays provide a platform for realizing spin-1/2 Hamiltonians with long-range tunneling that decays as a power law with distance. We numerically investigate the effects of positional disorder and dimerization on the properties of excited states in such a one-dimensional system. Our model allows for continuous tuning of both the dimerization pattern and the disorder strength. Within the parameter space constrained by our geometry, we show that both mechanisms lead to a localized phase that does not resemble standard MBL. This phase can be understood as an ensemble of distinct Hilbert space fragmented realizations induced by small inter-spin separations. As dimerization is commonly associated with Symmetry Protected Topological (SPT) physics, we also examine the SPT states across the entire energy spectrum. Despite a partial spin-glass order, we argue that the system hosts an extensive fraction of SPT states.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.07720v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Crossover between intrinsic and temperature-assisted regimes in spin-orbit torque switching of antiferromagnetic order</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27138</link><description>arXiv:2510.27138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intensive studies have been made on antiferromagnets as candidate materials for next generation memory bits due to their ultrafast dynamics reaching picosecond time scales. Recent demonstrations of electrical bidirectional switching of antiferromagnetic states have attracted significant attention. However, under the presence of significant Joule heating that destabilizes the magnetic order, the timescales associated with the switching can be limited to nanoseconds or longer. Here, we present the observation of a crossover in the switching behavior of the chiral antiferromagnet Mn3Sn by tuning the magnetic layer thickness. While Joule heating interferes with switching in thicker devices, we find clear signatures of an intrinsic spin-orbit torque mechanism as the thickness is reduced, avoiding the heating effect. The suppression of heating enables switching without significant attenuation of the readout signal using pulses shorter than those required by temperature-assisted mechanisms. The crossover into the spin-orbit torque switching behavior clarifies the potential for achieving ultrafast switching as expected from the picosecond spin dynamics of antiferromagnets. Our results lay the groundwork for designing antiferromagnetic memory devices that can operate at ultrafast timescales.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.27138v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Polymer-assisted wet-chemical synthesis and characterization of zinc sulphide nanoparticles by hydrothermal and co-precipitation methods</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07554</link><description>arXiv:2601.07554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zinc sulphide (ZnS) is a non-toxic, wide-bandgap II-VI semiconductor with well-established optoelectronic properties. In this work, ZnS quantum dots (QDs) were synthesized using polymer-assisted wet-chemical routes, namely hydrothermal processing and room-temperature co-precipitation. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) were employed as capping agents to investigate their influence on particle growth, dispersion, and optical behaviour. Room-temperature co-precipitation produced ZnS QDs with crystallite sizes as small as 2.03 nm, whereas hydrothermal synthesis at elevated temperature resulted in larger crystallites exceeding approximately 6 nm. X-ray diffraction confirmed the formation of cubic zinc-blende ZnS in all samples, with peak broadening and minor lattice parameter variations associated with nanoscale dimensions. UV-visible absorption spectra exhibited systematic shifts in the absorption edge, with optical bandgap values ranging from 3.60 eV to 3.80 eV, consistent with size-dependent quantum confinement effects. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering measurements verified effective polymer capping and particle size distribution, with PVP providing stronger growth suppression and improved dispersion compared to PEG. These results provide insight into the role of polymer-nanocrystal interactions in wet-chemical synthesis and demonstrate how synthesis route and polymer chemistry influence the structural and optical properties of ZnS nanoparticles.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07554v2</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] Crypto-RV: High-Efficiency FPGA-Based RISC-V Cryptographic Co-Processor for IoT Security</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04415</link><description>arXiv:2602.04415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryptographic operations are critical for securing IoT, edge computing, and autonomous systems. However, current RISC-V platforms lack efficient hardware support for comprehensive cryptographic algorithm families and post-quantum cryptography. This paper presents Crypto-RV, a RISC-V co-processor architecture that unifies support for SHA-256, SHA-512, SM3, SHA3-256, SHAKE-128, SHAKE-256 AES-128, HARAKA-256, and HARAKA-512 within a single 64-bit datapath. Crypto-RV introduces three key architectural innovations: a high-bandwidth internal buffer (128x64-bit), cryptography-specialized execution units with four-stage pipelined datapaths, and a double-buffering mechanism with adaptive scheduling optimized for large-hash. Implemented on Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA at 160 MHz with 0.851 W dynamic power, Crypto-RV achieves 165 times to 1,061 times speedup over baseline RISC-V cores, 5.8 times to 17.4 times better energy efficiency compared to powerful CPUs. The design occupies only 34,704 LUTs, 37,329 FFs, and 22 BRAMs demonstrating viability for high-performance, energy-efficient cryptographic processing in resource-constrained IoT environments.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04415v1</guid></item><item><title>[cs.AR updates on arXiv.org] A Parameterizable Convolution Accelerator for Embedded Deep Learning Applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04044</link><description>arXiv:2602.04044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolutional neural network (CNN) accelerators implemented on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are typically designed with a primary focus on maximizing performance, often measured in giga-operations per second (GOPS). However, real-life embedded deep learning (DL) applications impose multiple constraints related to latency, power consumption, area, and cost. This work presents a hardware-software (HW/SW) co-design methodology in which a CNN accelerator is described using high-level synthesis (HLS) tools that ease the parameterization of the design, facilitating more effective optimizations across multiple design constraints. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed design methodology is able to outperform non-parameterized design approaches, and it can be easily extended to other types of DL applications.</description><author>cs.AR updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04044v1</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Environmental and societal costs of maize production decrease by addressing the uncertainty in nitrogen rate recommendations</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68988-y</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 05 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68988-y"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-68988-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Excess nitrogen fertilization in maize production harms the environment and society, yet farmers face yield risks when reducing inputs.
